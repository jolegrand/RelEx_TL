Seven polymorphic variants in genes drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 and drug7 were associated with drug8 . 
Noteworthy , the considerable number of patients carrying drug1 and drug2 alleles underlies the importance of considering pharmacogenetic testing before starting drug therapy protocols to prevent toxicity and/or lack of effectiveness in drug3 or drug4 virus infections .

The best-studied functional genetic variant relevant to drug2 treatment is drug1 , a single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the OPRM1 gene that encodes the u-opioid receptor . 
METHODS : The association between the OPRM1 A118G ( Asn40Asp , drug1 ) polymorphism and drug2 and alcohol consumption was analyzed using three different population-based samples : ( a ) a Finnish cohort study , Health 2000 , with 503 participants having a DSM-IV diagnosis for drug3 and/or drug4 and 506 age- and sex-matched controls ; ( b ) a Finnish cohort study , FINRISK ( n = 2360 ) and ( c ) the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study ( n = 1384 ) . 
In the case-control study that included 187patients with drug2 ( cases ) and 189 normal subjects ( controls ) , the AA genotype and variant Met allele frequencies of drug1 in the COMTgene were significantly higher in patients with drug3 than those in the control group ( both p <0.05 ) . 
Compared with nonsmokers , European-American COMT drug1 double-variant carriers who smoked had increased odds of drug2 [adjusted odds ratio ( AOR ) 6.15 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.32-28.78 ) ] ; 
European-American COMT drug1 double-variant carriers who smoked heavily had more frequent moderate or severe drug2 than nonsmokers ( AOR 13.7 , 95 % CI 1.2-154.9 ) . 
European-American drug1 double-variant carriers who smoked described more frequent moderate or severe drug2 than nonsmoking ( AOR 20.6 , 95 % CI 1.64-257.93 ) and never-smoking ( AOR 20.59 , 95 % CI 1.39-304.68 ) carriers , respectively . 
African-American single-variant drug1 carriers who smoked were more likely to report drug2 than the nonsmoking carriers ( AOR 6.16 , 95 % CI 1.11-33.91 ) . 
This study aimed to test the association between the Val158Met polymorphism drug1 of the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene andanorexia nervosa drug2 . 
The present association studies found no association between drug2 and drug1 when testing the allelic contrast [Utrecht odds ratio ( OR ) =1.14 , P=0.14 ; Leiden OR=1.02 , P=0.85 ] . 
Meta-analytically combined evidence from the present genotypings and the literature search shows that the effect sizes are homogeneous across studies and that drug1 is not associated with drug2 . 
the COMT drug1 SNP that reduces enzyme activity , has previously been linked to drug2 . 
Although the drug1 SNP was not a risk factor for drug2 , 
We conclude that the functional COMT drug1 SNP contributes to drug2 , drug3 and drug4 . 
The authors examined relations between reproductive factors and 5 estrogen pathway gene polymorphisms ( drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and COMT drug5 ) among 702 Singapore Chinese female drug6 cases and 1,578 hospital controls , of whom 433 cases ( 61.7 % ) and 1,375 controls ( 87.1 % ) were never smokers . 
The COMT drug1 A allele was positively associated with drug2 in never smokers ( for G/A or A/A vs. G/G , OR = 1.46 , 95 % CI : 1.12 , 1.90 ) but not in ever smokers . 
Thus , we hypothesized that ( 1 ) the COMT gene contributes to drug2 and ( 2 ) a COMT polymorphism ( drug1 : Val158Met ) causing thermolability of enzymatic activity affects liver enzymes ( e.g. , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( γ-GT ) ) in serum . 
Recently we identified two SNPs in COMT ( drug1 and drug2 ) that are associated with drug3 in an Australian cohort . 
Individuals with drug3 were more than twice as likely to carry the GG genotype compared to the AA genotype for both the drug1 and drug2 SNPs . 
Association of both drug1 and drug2 withsubstance dependence , a common comorbidity of drug3 has not been investigated . 
The drug1 SNP was associated with drug2 . 
The drug1 SNP showed a weak association with drug2 at the allele level that did not reach significance at the genotype level but it was not associated with drug3 . 
Analysis of drug1 haplotypes also revealed association with drug2 with the G/Ghaplotype being almost 1.5 times more common in drug3 cases . 
It is possible that the drug1 SNP , in combination with drug2 , results in a common molecular variant of COMT that contributes to drug3 and drug4 susceptibility . 
However , when this relation was assessed within strata based on estrogen-related factors , a few SNPs ( HSD17B1 ( drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ) , COMT ( drug4 ) , UGT1A1 ( drug5 ) and ESR1 ( drug6 ) seemed to be related to drug7 in the same direction of their associations with drug8 . 
we examined variations in maternal and fetal COMT genes and their association with drug5 ( term vs preterm pregnancies ) using 4 functional SNPs : drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 in both AA and Cau . 
In conclusion , our study demonstrated that a synonymous polymorphism , drug1 in the fetal COMT gene , is associated with drug2 in AA . 
Variants of drug1 drug2 and drug3 were not associated with the risk of developing drug4 . 
A common C-G-C-C-G-A haplotype for drug1 - drug2 - drug3 - drug4 - drug5 - drug6 showed an inverse association with drug7 risk in Hispanic Caucasians ( OR = 0.19 , P = 0.04 , 95 % CI = 0.04-0.95 ) and with aggressive disease status ( i.e. Gleason score >or=7 ) in non-Hispanic Caucasian cases ( OR = 0.64 , P = 0.008 , 95 % CI = 0.47-0.89 ) . 
A subset of 82 patients also underwent drug8 testing , Patients were genotyped for the MTHFR 677C>T drug1 drug2 , MTR 2756A>G drug3 MTRR 203A>G drug4 , FOLH1 484T>C drug5 , RFC 80A>G drug6 and COMT675G>A drug7 polymorphisms . 
A common Val->Met polymorphism ( drug1 ) in the COMT gene , associated with increased prefrontal dopamine catabolism , impairs prefrontal cognition and might increase risk for drug2 . 
We have previously found an association with drug1 and drug2 addiction . 
Our results suggest that individual susceptibility to drug4 incidence may be increased by combined effects of the high-risk genotypes in drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 estrogen metabolic genes . 
The Val108/158Met drug1 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene contributes to genetic susceptibility to drug2 , which is specifically related to impairments in executive functioning . 
A different genomic region composed of three SNPs ( drug1 , drug2 , drug3 ) within the COMT gene has been reported to be significantly associated with drug4 in Ashkenazi Jews . 
The SNP drug1 , which has been mapped to the 3'-UTR region of the COMT gene , was significantly associated with drug2 in our family study , and possibly associated with the age of onset , delusion/hallucination symptom dimension , and CPT performance . 
Therefore , COMT may contribute to the genetic risk for drug2 not through the drug1 polymorphism , but through other variants that are situated 3 ' to this region , in the Taiwanese population . 
OBJECTIVE : The T allele of a functional polymorphism ( drug1 : LCT-13910 C>T ) , close to the lactase gene , correlates with drug2 ( LP ) in adults . 
Our aim was to test in this study , the association of drug1 with BMI and related drug2 , in interaction with dairy product consumption . 
drug2 ( PLI ) was defined as the C/C genotype of the drug1 polymorphism . 
We hypothesized that individuals with the drug2 allele of the LCT SNP ( drug1 ) would exhibit a greater degree of drug3 and that this relationship would be mediated by lactose consumption . 
The C/T-13910 lactasevariant ( drug1 ) was genotyped in 630 men with drug2 and 873 matched control participants . 
The -13910C>T polymorphism ( drug1 ) upstream from the lactase ( LCT ) gene , strongly associated with drug2 ( LP ) in Europeans , is emerging as a new candidate for drug3 . 
In contrast , haplotypes at another block tagged by drug1 associated with prevalent drug2 ( b=0.239 , p= 2.05 * 10 ( -4 ) ) , but remarkably these are inversely associated with disease severity ( b=-0.196 , p=0.003 ) . 
The presence of four common oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms ( drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ) was evaluated in one hundred women with drug5 and one hundred healthy women using restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping . 
In haplotype analysis , the haplotype combination of drug1 A allele , drug2 C allele and drug3 G allele was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of drug4 ( OR=3.2 [CI 1.04-9.8 ] , p=0.043 ) . 
With respect to OXTR drug1 , mothers with the GG genotype showed greater drug2 across varying levels of interparental conflict . 
The aim of this study was to investigate whether a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) within cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 , drug1 and drug2 ) and oxytocin receptor ( OXTR , drug3 and drug4 ) genes was associated with drug5 , response or remission . 
For this purpose , two single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , 6930G>A ( drug1 ) and 9073G>A ( drug2 ) , within the oxytocin receptor gene ( OXTR ) , were studied in a cohort of 185 patients with major drug3 ( 50.3 % ) or drug4 I or II disorders ( 49.7 % ) and 192 matched healthy controls . 
A positive association between the GG genotype of drug1 SNPs ( 6930G>A or 9073G>A ) and unipolar drug2 was demonstrated . 
For drug1 , overtransmission of the G allele to probands with drug2 disorder was found which contrasts with the overtransmission of A previously reported in the Chinese Han sample . 
RESULTS : The family-based association test ( FBAT ) revealed a significant genetic association between drug3 and two of the SNPs tested ( drug1 A : Z = 2.287 , p = .0222 ; drug2 A : Z = 2.573 , p = .0101 ) . 
When haplotypes were constructed with two , three , and four markers , the haplotype-specific FBAT revealed that a number of haplotypes , particularly those involving drug1 , were significantly associated with drug2 . 
CONCLUSIONS : Our meta-analysis suggests that the G allele of drug1 polymorphism might be a potential risk factor for drug2 , especially in whitepopulations . 
The real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was used to analyze 4 SNPs ( drug1 A/G , drug2 A/G , drug3 A/G , drug4 C/G ) in 291 drug5 patients and 247 controls . 
Analysis of 4 SNPs revealed a significant difference in the genotype distribution for drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 between drug5 patients and controls ( p = 0.041 , p = 0.005 , p = 0.023 , respectively ) but not for drug4 ( p = 0.211 ) . 
Minor alleles in three correlated ht SNPs ( drug1 , , drug2 , and drug3 ; r ( 2 ) >0.6 ) were associated with increased risk for drug4 .
