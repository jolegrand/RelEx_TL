We have determined 4 frequent nonsynonymous gene polymorphisms of CYP1B1 in the human tumor cell lines panels of the National CancerInstitute (NCI) and the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR):rs10012 (R48G), rs1056827 (A119S),  rs1056836 (L432V), and  rs1800440 (N453S)	
Seven polymorphic variants in genes CYP1A1, GSTM1, ABCB1, NOS3, IL6, CCR5 and ACE were associated with CAP.	
Noteworthy, the considerable number of patients carrying CYP2B6 (516T) and IL28B (12007005T) alleles underlies the importance of considering pharmacogenetic testing before starting drug therapy protocols to prevent toxicity and/or lack of effectiveness in AIDS or hepatitis C virus infections.

The best-studied functional genetic variant relevant to alcoholism treatment is rs1799971, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the OPRM1 gene that encodes the u-opioid receptor.	
METHODS: The association between the OPRM1 A118G (Asn40Asp, rs1799971) polymorphism and  alcohol use disorders and alcohol consumption was analyzed using three different population-based samples: (a) a Finnish cohort study, Health 2000, with 503 participants having a DSM-IV diagnosis for alcohol dependence and/or alcohol abuse and 506 age- and sex-matched controls; (b) a Finnish cohort study, FINRISK (n = 2360) and (c) the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (n = 1384).	
In the case-control study that included 187patients with preeclampsia (cases) and 189 normal subjects (controls), the AA genotype and variant Met allele frequencies of Val158Met in the COMTgene were significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia than those in the control group (both p <0.05).	
Compared with nonsmokers, European-American COMT Val158Met double-variant carriers who smoked had increased odds of hot flashes [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-28.78)];	
European-American COMT Val158Met double-variant carriers who smoked heavily had more frequent moderate or severe hot flashes than nonsmokers (AOR 13.7, 95% CI 1.2-154.9).	
European-American CYP 1B1*3  double-variant carriers who smoked described more frequent moderate or severe hot flashes than nonsmoking (AOR 20.6, 95% CI 1.64-257.93) and never-smoking (AOR 20.59, 95% CI 1.39-304.68) carriers, respectively.	
African-American single-variantCYP 1A2  carriers who smoked were more likely to report  hot flashes than the nonsmoking carriers (AOR 6.16, 95% CI 1.11-33.91).	
This study aimed to test the association between the Val158Met polymorphism rs4680 of the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene andanorexia nervosa (AN).	
The present association studies found no association between AN and rs4680 when testing the allelic contrast [Utrecht odds ratio (OR)=1.14, P=0.14; Leiden OR=1.02, P=0.85].	
Meta-analytically combined evidence from the present genotypings and the literature search shows that the effect sizes are homogeneous across studies and that rs4680 is not associated with AN.	
the COMT Val158Met SNP that reduces enzyme activity, has previously been linked to pain sensitivity.	
Although the Val158Met SNP was not a risk factor for  disc herniation,	
We conclude that the functional COMT Val158Met SNP contributes to long lasting low back pain, sciatica and disability after lumbar disc herniation.	
The authors examined relations between reproductive factors and 5 estrogen pathway gene polymorphisms (CYP17 rs743572, CYP19A1 rs10046, ERb rs1256049, ERb rs4986938, and COMT rs4680) among 702 Singapore Chinese female lung cancer cases and 1,578 hospital controls, of whom 433 cases (61.7%) and 1,375 controls (87.1%) were never smokers.	
The COMT rs4680 A allele was positively associated with lung cancer in never smokers (for G/A or A/A vs. G/G, OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.90) but not in ever smokers.	
Thus, we hypothesized that (1) the COMT gene contributes to liver homeostasis and (2) a COMT polymorphism (rs4680: Val158Met) causing thermolability of enzymatic activity affects liver enzymes (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT)) in serum.	
Recently we identified two SNPs in COMT (rs4680 and rs165774) that are associated with schizophrenia in an Australian cohort.	
Individuals with schizophrenia were more than twice as likely to carry the GG genotype compared to the AA genotype for both the rs165774 and rs4680 SNPs.	
Association of both rs4680 and rs165774 withsubstance dependence, a common comorbidity of schizophrenia has not been investigated.	
The rs165774 SNP was associated with alcohol dependence.	
The rs4680 SNP showed a weak association with alcohol dependence at the allele level that did not reach significance at the genotype level but it was not associated with nicotine or opiate dependence.	
Analysis of rs165774/rs4680 haplotypes also revealed association with alcohol dependence with the G/Ghaplotype being almost 1.5 times more common in alcohol-dependent cases.	
It is possible that the rs165774 SNP, in combination with rs4680, results in a common molecular variant of COMT that contributes to schizophrenia and alcohol dependence susceptibility.	
However, when this relation was assessed within strata based on estrogen-related factors, a few SNPs (HSD17B1 (rs2010750,rs598126 and rs676387),COMT (rs4680), UGT1A1 (rs8175347) and ESR1 (rs9340799) seemed to be related to MD in the same direction of their associations with breast cancerrisk.	
we examined variations in maternal and fetal COMT genes and their association with pregnancy outcomes (term vs preterm pregnancies) using 4 functional SNPs: rs4633,rs4680,rs4818, and rs6269 in both AA and Cau.	
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that a synonymous polymorphism, rs4818 in the fetal COMT gene, is associated with PTB in AA.	
Variants ofDRD2 Taq1A , COMT and DAT1 were not associated with the risk of developing ICDs.	
A common C-G-C-C-G-A haplotype for rs2567206-rs2551188-rs2617266-rs10012-rs1056836-rs1800440 showed an inverse association with PCa risk in Hispanic Caucasians (OR = 0.19, P = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.04-0.95) and with aggressive disease status (i.e. Gleason score >or=7) in non-Hispanic Caucasian cases (OR = 0.64, P = 0.008, 95% CI = 0.47-0.89).	
A subset of 82 patients also underwent nonfasting serum folate testing, Patients were genotyped for the MTHFR 677C>T rs1801133 ,  MTHFR 1298A>C rs1801131, MTR 2756A>G  rs1805087 , MTRR 203A>G rs1801394, FOLH1 484T>C rs202676, RFC 80A>G rs1051266 , and COMT675G>A rs4680 polymorphisms .	
A common Val->Met polymorphism (rs4680) in the COMT gene, associated with increased prefrontal dopamine catabolism, impairs prefrontal cognition and might increase risk for schizophrenia.	
We have previously found an association with rs4680 and MAMP addiction.	
Our results suggest that individual susceptibility to breast cancer incidence may be increased by combined effects of the high-risk genotypes in CYP1B1,COMT, and MnSOD estrogen metabolic genes.	
The Val108/158Met (rs4680) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene contributes to genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, which is specifically related to impairments in executive functioning.	
A different genomic region composed of three SNPs(rs737865, rs4680, rs165599) within the COMT gene has been reported to be significantly associated with schizophrenia in Ashkenazi Jews.	
The SNP rs165599, which has been mapped to the 3'-UTR region of the COMT gene, was significantly associated with schizophrenia in our family study, and possibly associated with the age of onset, delusion/hallucination symptom dimension, and CPT performance.	
Therefore, COMT may contribute to the genetic risk for schizophrenia not through the Val108/158Met polymorphism, but through other variants that are situated 3' to this region, in the Taiwanese population.	
OBJECTIVE: The T allele of a functional polymorphism (rs4988235: LCT-13910 C>T), close to the lactase gene, correlates with lactase persistence (LP) in adults.	
Our aim was to test in this study, the association of rs4988235 with BMI and related metabolic diseases, in interaction with dairy product consumption.	
Primary lactose intolerance (PLI) was defined as the C/C genotype of the rs4988235 polymorphism.	
We hypothesized that individuals with the lactase persistence(LP) allele of the LCT SNP (rs4988235) would exhibit a greater degree of adiposity and that this relationship would be mediated by lactose consumption.	
The C/T-13910 lactasevariant (rs4988235) was genotyped in 630 men with prostate cancer and 873 matched control participants.	
The -13910C>T polymorphism (rs4988235) upstream from the lactase (LCT) gene, strongly associated with lactase persistence (LP) in Europeans, is emerging as a new candidate for obesity.	
In contrast, haplotypes at another block tagged by rs518394 associated with prevalent MI (b=0.239, p= 2.05*10(-4)), but remarkably these are inversely associated with disease severity (b=-0.196, p=0.003).	
The presence of four common oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms (rs2254298, rs53576, rs2228485 and rs237911) was evaluated in one hundred women with preterm birth and one hundred healthy women using restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping.	
In haplotype analysis, the haplotype combination of rs2254298 A allele, rs2228485 C allele and rs237911 G allele was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (OR=3.2 [CI 1.04-9.8], p=0.043).	
With respect to OXTR rs53576, mothers with the GG genotype showed greater differential maternal sensitivity across varying levels of interparental conflict.	
The aim of this study was to investigate whether a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, rs5275 and rs20417) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR, rs53576 and rs2254298) genes was associated with antidepressant treatment resistance, response or remission.	
For this purpose, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 6930G>A (rs53576) and 9073G>A (rs2254298), within the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), were studied in a cohort of 185 patients with major depression (50.3%) or bipolar I or II disorders (49.7%) and 192 matched healthy controls.	
A positive association between the GG genotype of OXTR SNPs (6930G>A or 9073G>A) and unipolar depression was demonstrated.	
For rs2254298, overtransmission of the G allele to probands with autistic disorder was found which contrasts with the overtransmission of A previously reported in the Chinese Han sample.	
RESULTS: The family-based association test (FBAT) revealed a significant genetic association between autism and two of the SNPs tested (rs2254298 A: Z = 2.287, p = .0222; rs53576 A: Z = 2.573, p = .0101).	
When haplotypes were constructed with two, three, and four markers, the haplotype-specific FBAT revealed that a number of haplotypes, particularly those involving rs53576, were significantly associated with autism.	
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the G allele of AR StuI polymorphism might be a potential risk factor for AGA, especially in whitepopulations.	
The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze 4 SNPs (rs10757274 A/G, rs2383207 A/G, rs10757278 A/G, rs1333049 C/G) in 291 MetS patients and 247 controls.	
Analysis of 4 SNPs revealed a significant difference in the genotype distribution for rs2383207, rs10757278, and rs1333049 between MetS patients and controls (p = 0.041, p = 0.005, p = 0.023, respectively) but not for rs10757274 (p = 0.211).	
Minor alleles in three correlated ht SNPs (rs6152, ,rs1204038, and rs1337082; r(2) >0.6) were associated with increased risk for endometrial cancer.
