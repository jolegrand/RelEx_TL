the val108/158met drug1 single nucleotide polymorphism -lrb- snp -rrb- in the catechol-o-methyltransferase -lrb- comt -rrb- gene contribute to genetic susceptibility to drug2 , which be specifically related to impairment in executive functioning . 
a different genomic region compose of three snp -lrb- drug1 , drug2 , drug3 -rrb- within the COMT gene have be report to be significantly associate with drug4 in Ashkenazi Jews . 
the snp drug1 , which have be map to the 3 ' - utr region of the COMT gene , be significantly associate with drug2 in we family study , and possibly associate with the age of onset , delusion/hallucination symptom dimension , and CPT performance .
