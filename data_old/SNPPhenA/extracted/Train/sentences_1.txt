Gene expression analysis indicated an association between genotypes of the rs1051730 variant and CHRNA5 expression in brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and with the rs16969968 and rs17477223 variants in brain.	
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of   APOE genotypes, the intake of saturated fatty acids(SFA), and obesity on serum lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population.	
CONCLUSIONS:  APOE genotypes, SFA intake, and obesity were found to be associated with blood lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population.	
Analysis of gene-diet and gene-obesity interactions did not confirm that the effects of diet and obesity on TC and LDL-C level significantly depended on APOE genotype.	
Inside this region of 16.3 kb, LD (r2 = 0.14) between TOMM40 rs157590 and APOE rs429358 was observed in PPA, but not in bvFTD and in controls.	
RESULTS: In the discovery population, we observed an association between SIRT2 rs10410544 T allele and AD (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.50, P = .02, after correction for sex, age, and APOE e4 genotype).	
The association between AD and SIRT2 rs10410544 T allele was only present in APOE e4 noncarriers (adjusted OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.61, P = .03).	
Over an average period of three years, participants with the risk-conferring TT genotype at rs7903146 were more likely to have progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes than were CC homozygotes (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.01; P<0.001).	
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of   ApoE polymorphisms did not differ between patients with RA and controls.	
The results indicated that homozygous APOE e4 carriers aged 35 years or older had worse cognitive function than heterozygous carriers and noncarriers.	
Nine loci were statistically associated with incident CHD events in white participants: 9p21 (rs10757278; P=4.7 * 10(-41)), 16q23.1 (rs2549513; P=0.0004), 6p24.1 (rs499818; P=0.0002), 2q36.3 (rs2943634; P=6.7 * 10(-6)), MTHFD1L (rs6922269, P=5.1 * 10(-10)),APOE (rs429358; P=2.7*10(-18)), ZNF627 (rs4804611; P=5.0 * 10(-8)), CXCL12 (rs501120; P=1.4 * 10(-6)) and LPL (rs268; P=2.7 * 10(-17))	
BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) functional haplotypes determined by rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs have been extensively studied and found to be one of the most consistent association in human longevity studies.	
There were also no significant effects of   APOE2 or E4 carriers on the development of DN, but multivariate logistic regression testing revealed that the duration of diabetes and triglyceride and hemoglobin A1c concentrations had independent effects on the development of DN.	
RESULTS: Significant associations with FTD were observed for genotypes rs449647 A/T (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-4.5), rs769446 T/C (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.9-10.2), and APOE e3/e4 (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.6-10.9)	
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor polymorphism (rs1051730) on chromosome 15q25 is associated with major tobacco-related diseases in the general population with additional increased risk of COPD as well as lung cancer.	
Although there was only moderate linkage disequilibrium between rs2075650 and the ApoE e4 defining SNP rs429358, we could not find an APOE-independent effect of rs2075650 on longevity, either in cross-sectional or in longitudinal analyses.	
In conclusion, the major locus determining familial longevity up to high age as detected by GWAS was marked by rs2075650, which tags the deleterious effects of the ApoE e4 allele.	
RESULTS: After correcting for multiple testing (p<0.05) and accounting for significant differences in the association effect sizes between subjects with and without MetS (p<0.05), variants of APOA5 (rs662799) and APOE (rs429358) were associated with HDL-C and LDL-C responses in MetS subjects, while APOA4 rs675 was associated with TG response in non-MetS subjects.	
Our findings confirm that the TCF7L2 gene represents an important locus for predicting inherited susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.	
Five polymorphisms (-491 rs449647, -427 rs769446, -219 rs405509, and e rs429358-rs7412) were studied in 1308 AD patients and 1082 control individuals from the Central-Northern Italy.	
BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (e2/e3/e4: rs429358 e4 allele; rs7412 e2 allele) is strongly associated with both lipid levels and Alzheimer's disease.	
As expected, the most strongly  associated SNP was the APOE e4 rs429358 variant (HR=2.47 [1.58, 3.87], p=7.52*10(-5)), although variants within the more recently implicated SORL1 and RUNX1 genes were also strongly associated with DAD in DS (HR=0.54 [0.37, 0.80], p=0.002 and HR=1.61 [1.15, 2.26], p=0.006 respectively).	
Disease association analysis revealed a susceptibility haplotype CGTC (in order of rs440446, rs769450, rs429358, rs7412) and the carriers of this haplotype has higher risk of osteopenia (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.21-11.0, P=0.017) and osteoporosis (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.53-9.48, P=0.002) after adjusting the confounding effect of age, BMI and years since menopause.	
RESULTS: With multivariate generalized linear models, the association of TEF rs738499 with depressive symptoms was confirmed.	
Several markers in strong LD (r(2) > 0.7) with rs3183702 were found to be significantly associated with AD risk in recent genome-wide association studies with similar effect sizes, providing independent support of the current findings.	
The frequency of the G genotype in COMT rs4680 was statistically different between patients with NSCLC and controls (P = .04), and between patients with adenocarcinomas (ADC) and controls (P = .02).	
The frequency of the A genotype in PLCH1 rs181696 occurred more frequently in squamous cell carcinomas (SQC) than in controls (P = .02).	
The G/G homozygous genotype in COMT rs4680 and A/A homozygous genotype in PLCH1 rs181696 were associated with ADC and SQC, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 0.61 and OR 2.01, respectively).	
In this study, we found that the COMT rs4680 SNP was significantly associated with a reduced risk of NSCLC, especially ADC, which suggests that this SNP may have a protective effect.	
Moreover, the PLCH1 rs181696 SNP was strongly associated with an increased risk of SQC,	
OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype has been associated with systemic inflammation and athero-thrombosis however the association with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has not been previously examined.	
CONCLUSIONS: We found no consistent association between ApoE genotype and AAA.	
RESULTS: As previously reported in Spain, APOE epsilon 4 allele was strongly associated with AD in our series (OR=2.88 [95% C.I. 2.16- 3.84], p=7.38E-11).	
Our results strengthen the evidence that one or more variants in TCF7L2 are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes.	
No combined effect of COMT/OPRM1 polymorphisms on CPP phenotypes was observed.	
COMT didn't affect CPP, suggesting its potential modality-specific effects on human pain.	
We compared genotype frequencies in subjects with type 2 diabetes with those with NGT and found marginal association for rs7901695 (P = 0.05; odds ratio [OR] 1.51);	
comparison between NGT control subjects and the combined type 2 diabetes/IGT case group showed strong association with rs7901695 and rs7903146 (P = 0.008-0.01; OR 1.53-1.57) and marginal association with rs11196205 and rs12255372 (P = 0.07 and P = 0.04, respectively).	
We also genotyped these SNPs in nondiabetic, non-Amish subjects (n = 48), in whom intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed, and found an association between rs7901695 and rs7903146 and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively) and disposition index (P = 0.04 and P = 0.007, respectively).	
Thus, the Val158Met COMT polymorphism is not associated with PD in the Caucasian population but acts as a modifier of the AAO in PD with a sexual dimorphism: the Val allele is associated with a younger AAO in men with idiopathic PD.	
The rs7903146 T at-risk allele associates with decreased BMI and earlier age at diagnosis in the type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 8.0 x 10(-3) and P = 3.8 x 10(-4), respectively), which is supported by quantitative family-based association tests.	
CONCLUSIONS: COMT Val158Met was seen to show a decreased risk for endometrial cancer in Asian population	
CYP1B1 Leu432Val and Asn453Ser polymorphisms demonstrated an increased and decreased risk for endometrial cancer, respectively.	
RESULTS: We found no association between smoking status and SNP rs4680 genotype nor did we find a significant association to the degree of tobacco dependence	
CONCLUSIONS: Although prefrontal cortical and ventral striatal activity are highly relevant for addictive behavior, and under partial control of COMT rs4680 genotype, no association between COMT and smoking behavior was observed	
Our data strongly confirm that variants of the TCF7L2 gene contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes.	
In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that in addition to other genes,   COMT also has a significant role in the development of depression, and demonstrate that analysing the complex phenotype associations of genes by haplotype tagging is a powerful method.	
In contrast to previous findings, analysis by logistic regression failed to find any associations between rs4680 and psychotic symptoms.	
Although prefrontal cortical and ventral striatal activity are highly relevant for addictive behavior, and under partial control of COMT rs4680 genotype, no association between   COMT and smoking behavior was observed.	
A significant association was observed between, CYP1A1 rs1048943 (OR = 1.95, C.I. 1.13-3.36) and GSTP1 rs1695 (OR = 2.39, C.I. 1.24-4.24) polymorphisms with the risk of breast cancer.	
We observed a strong association type 2 diabetes with all the polymorphisms, including rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.50 [95% CI = 1.24-1.82], p = 4.0 x 10(-5)), rs4506565 (OR 1.48 [95% CI = 1.24-1.77], p = 2.0 x 10(-5)) and rs7903146 (OR 1.46 [95% CI = 1.22-1.75], p = 3.0 x 10(-5)).	
We found no association of the TCF7L2 genotypes with age at diagnosis, BMI or WHR, but the risk genotype at rs12255372 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.001), higher 2-h plasma glucose (p = 0.0002) and higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R; p = 0.012) in non-diabetic subjects.	
However, we found an association between COMT GG genotype (Val/Val) and APOE e4 carrier status and the risk of AD and MCI.	
However,COMT: rs4680: A>G and rs4633: C>T polymorphisms were found to significantly affect PD risk, and the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism helped determine plasma Hcy concentrations.	
The association of   OPRM1 with the ADHD and SUD combination could help to explain the contradictory results of previous studies.	
There were no significant associations between COMT genotypes and CSI or ICAI.	
The Met158 allele of the COMT gene confers a significantly increased risk for aggressive and violent behavior in schizophrenia.	
The data show a statistical association and suggest biological plausibility that the rs6495309T>C polymorphism contributed to increased risks and poor prognosis of both COPD and lung cancer.	
The increased volumes in the genu, splenium and total CC in the 22q11DS group were associated with polymorphisms within the candidate genes: COMT rs4680, ZDHHC8 rs175174 and UFD1L (rs5992403).	
The OPRM1 A118G genotype was associated with patients' postoperative Numerical Pain scale (NPS) ratings at 15 min in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (p = .01) and patients'sedation scores at 15 min in the PACU (p = .02).	
COMT genotype rs4818 was associated with opioid consumption in the first 45 min in the PACU (p = .04).	
Our haplotype trend analysis identified a COMT haplotype GCGG significantly associated with NPS at 15 min (p = .0013), amount of opioids consumed in the first 45 min (p = .0024), and heart rate at 45 min in the PACU (p = .017).	
Allele G fromCOMT SNPs rs4680 and rs165599 may represent reliable state-dependent predictors of global CD during manic and mixed episodes in BD.	
Moreover, the T allele at rs7903146 was inversely associated with log-transformed, HOMA-%B (beta=-0.07, p=0.005) as a measure of basal insulin secretion, and log-transformed fasting insulin (beta=-0.06, p=0.02).	
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor polymorphism rs1051730 on chromosome 15q25 is associated with major tobacco-related diseases in the general population with additional increased risk of COPD as well as lung cancer.	
Variant alleles of polymorphisms of TLR2 rs1898830, rs5743708, and rs3804100 demonstrated a consistent association with lung disease severity (p = 0.008, p = 0.006 and p = 0.029 respectively).	
Variant alleles of polymorphisms of TLR2 rs1898830, rs5743708, and rs3804100 demonstrated a consistent association with lung disease severity (p = 0.008, p = 0.006 and p = 0.029 respectively)	
Patients homozygous AA for TLR1 polymorphism rs5743551 are more frequently associated with faster decline of FEV1 compared to heterozygous genotype (OR:7.33 (95% CI:1.63-33.11)	
CONCLUSIONS: There is a close relationship between the presence of TLR3 rs5743313/CT and an increased risk of pneumonia in children infected by the pandemic A/H1N1/2009influenza virus.	
METHODS: Overall, 150 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites were genotyped for TLR2 gene variants -16934 (rs4696480), Arg753Gln (rs5743708), Pro631His (rs5743704) and the TLR2GT microsatellite polymorphism in intron 2.	
CONCLUSIONS: The study extends on the observation of a strong multiethnic association of polymorphisms in the TCRA and P2RY11 with narcolepsy, but does not confirm the association of CPT1B/CHKB (rs5770917) in the Chinese population.	
Common variation at rs1051730 is robustly associated with smoking quantity and was recently shown to influence smoking cessation during pregnancy, but its influence on birth weight is not clear.	
Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the risk allele (C) for SNP rs5770917 was significantly associated with decreased CPT1B mRNA expression (P = 1.0 * 10(-9)), and the CPT1B expression was higher in the narcolepsy patients than in the controls (P = 0.005).	
RESULTS: EHS was significantly associated with SNP rs5770917 (P(allele) = 3.6x10(-3); OR = 1.56; 95% c.i.: 1.12-2.15) and HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 haplotype (P(positivity) = 9.2x10(-11); OR = 3.97; 95% c.i.: 2.55-6.19).	
rs5770917, a SNP located between CPT1B and CHKB, was associated with narcolepsy in Japanese (rs5770917[C], odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, combined P = 4.4 x 10(-7)) and other ancestry groups (OR = 1.40, P = 0.02).	
rs5770917, a SNP located between CPT1B and CHKB, was associated with narcolepsy in Japanese (rs5770917[C], odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, combined P = 4.4 x 10(-7)) and other ancestry groups (OR = 1.40, P = 0.02).	
Case-control comparisons revealed higher prevalence of short CAG alleles as well as of the A allele of the rs6152 SNP in female Autism cases than in controls, but revealed no significant differences with respect to the GGN repeat.	
We identified Xq11-q12 as strongly associated with AGA, In particular, we found that rs1352015 located 8 kb from the EDA2R gene showed the best result (P=7.77e(-7)).	
In conditional logistic regression, there was no association between the number of alleles with CAG repeat length >or=21 (or >or=22) and risk of CVD, myocardial infarctions or ischemic stroke.	
In 2001, we published the first significant evidence of a genetic association between baldness and a synonymous coding SNP rs6152 in the androgen receptor gene, AR.	
We utilised statistical methods appropriate for the categorical nature of the phenotype and familial structure of the cohort, and determined that whilst SNP rs6152 was strongly associated with baldness (P < 0.0001), the GGN triplet repeat was not (P = 0.13).	
We genotyped the CAG microsatellite and six haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs962458, rs6152, rs1204038, rs2361634, rs1337080, rs1337082) of the androgen receptor gene in 987 ovarian cancer cases and 1,034 controls from a study conducted in New Hampshire and eastern Massachusetts between May 1992 and July 2003.	
We observed that carriage of two alleles with > or = 22 CAG repeats was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer compared with carriage of two alleles with <22 CAG repeats (covariate-adjusted odds ratios, 1.31; 95% confidence intervals, 1.01-1.69).	
Our results suggest that possession of two long AR alleles  or = 22 CAG repeats may be associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer compared with women with two short AR alleles (<22 CAG repeats).	
Recently, TCF7L2 variants, including the microsatellite marker DG10S478 and the nearly perfectly linked SNP rs12233372, were identified to associate with type 2 diabetes	
The T allele of rs12255372 showed an association with borderline significance (OR = 1.19, 95% C.I. = 1.01-1.42, P = 0.04), and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend revealed an allele dose-dependent association of rs12255372 with BC risk (Ptrend = 0.04).	
Our results suggest a possible influence of TCF7L2 rs12255372 on the risk of familial BC.	
Further, effects of a stronger beneficial association between n-3 PUFA in RBCs and plasma lipid parameters- including lower totalcholesterol (TC), lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations- were associated with AGT M235T (rs699) TT genotype, CETP G-971A (rs4783961) AG genotype, T allele carriers of CETP C-4502T (rs183130), and T allele carriers ofCETP Ile405Val (rs5882).	
Based on 12 studies with 5,573 MetS cases and 8,290 controls from 5 East Asian studies, 5 European studies and 2 studies of other ethnic groups, the -1131C allele was associated with increased risk of MetS with an OR (95% CI)  =  1.33 (1.16, 1.53) in the overall population, 1.43 (1.29, 1.58) in East Asian and 1.30 (0.94, 1.78) in European populations.	
In conclusion, the -1131C allele may be associated with elevated levels of fasting TG, TC, LDL-C and decreased HDL-C, and increased risk of MetS, especially in East Asians.	
Conclusion:This study highlights the gender-specific and weight-sensitive effects of APOA5 rs662799 on central obesity in Taiwanese individuals, and that these effects are dyslipidemia-independent and weight-loss responsive.	
Though APOA1/C3/A4/A5 genetic polymorphisms are associated with dyslipidemia, their effect on central obesity is less known	
The present study demonstrated that carrying rare alleles of APOA5 S19W, -1131T>C and G185C alone do not constitute a risk for ischemic stroke in the studied Turkish subjects.	
Multivariable logistic regression analysis of combined genotypes with adjustment for age, gender and diabetes mellitus revealed that rs662799 and rs6929846 significantly and synergistically affected dyslipidemia.	
Genetic variants of APOA5 and BTN2A1 may synergistically affect the prevalence of dyslipidemia in East Asian populations and of MetS in Japanese individuals.	
Our cross-sectional study confirmed the essential roles of the polymorphisms of the APOA5, GCK and GCKR in the lipid or glucose metabolism disorders, and suggested the importance of fat intake control in the individualized prevention of dyslipidemia.	
This study examined the associations of the APOA5 T-1131C (rs662799), G553T (Cys185Gly, rs2075291), GCK G-30A (rs1799884), GCKR A/G at intron16 (rs780094) and T1403C (Leu446Pro, rs1260326) polymorphisms with serum lipid and glucose levels in Japanese, considering lifestyle factors	
Moreover, a significant positive interaction between APOA5 553 G/T+T/T genotypes and fat intake > 25% of total energy for the risk of dyslipidemia was observed.	
PON1 and APOA5 polymorphisms may serve as biomarkers in the South Indian population to identify T2DM patients who are at risk of developing CAD.	
Two SNPs (rs2656069 and rs10851906) in IREB2 were associated with COPD (P=0.045 and 0.032, respectively) in non-smoker.	
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend and add new information to the existing data regarding the association between APOA5 and TG regulation during long-term atypical antipsychotic treatment.	
significant differences in the association effect sizes between subjects with and without MetS (p<0.05), variants of APOA5 (rs662799) and APOE (rs429358) were associated with HDL-C and LDL-C responses in MetS subjects, while APOA4 (rs675) was associated with TG response in non-MetS subjects.	
CONCLUSIONS: The APOA5-1131C allele, associated with higher fasting triglyceride levels, strongly affects the risk for early-onset MI, even after adjusting for triglycerides.	
The association of rs662799 with the number of the MetS components was significant regardless of age, sex, obesity and alcohol drinking, but almost disappeared after further adjusting for plasma triglycerides.	
CONCLUSIONS: While previous studies in adults demonstrated, that the APOA5 -1131C minor allele confers risk for adult metabolic syndrome, here we show, that the susceptibility nature of this SNP restricted to the APOA5*2 haplotype in pediatric obese subjects.	
OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) gene variants have been shown to be associated with elevated TG levels; the T-1131C (rs662799) variant has been reported to confer risk for the metabolic syndrome in adult populations.	
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) gene have been associated with hypertriglyceridaemia.	
BACKGROUND: Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the influence of several geneti c variants in genes related with triglyceride (TG) metabolism has been described, including LPL, APOA5 and APOE.	
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a significant independent additive effect on TG levels of the LPL polymorphisms HindIII, S447X, D9N and N291S; the S19W and -1131T/C variants of APOA5, and the epsilon4 allele of APOE in our study population.	
These results suggest that different SNPs in ApoA5 polymorphisms may be associated with triglyceride concentration and CVD in each of these ethnic origins.	
Homozygosity for the minor allele (TT) of SNP rs12255372 occurred in 9% of individuals and was associated with a 31% reduction in DI values in a recessive model.	
whereas rs12255372 genotype was not associated with measures of adiposity or with S(i).	
le of rs12255372 was also associated with increased prevalence of impaired fasting glucose.	
Genotypes at rs7903146 were not associated with any metabolic trait.	
Singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster are associated with FCH in Caucasians and with elevatedtriglycerides (TG) in various ethnic groups.	
We found that: (i) genotypes, including those of APOA5 S19W, APOA5 -1131T > C, APOE, GCKR, TRIB1 and TBL2/MLXIPL, were significantly associated with severe HTG; (ii) odds ratios for these genetic variables were significant in both univariate and multivariate regressionanalyses, irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes or obesity; (iii) a significant fraction-about one-quarter-of the explained variation in disease status was associated with these genotypes.	
However, no relationships were found between rs769446 genotype and plasma lipoprotein levels in 2 cohorts (n=1648 and n=1039) of healthy middle-aged carriers of the APOE e3/e3 genotype.	
CONCLUSIONS: rs769446 is a functional polymorphism involved in the regulation of the plasma APOE concentration.	
BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs429358 (e4) and rs7412 (e2), both invoking changes in the amino-acid sequence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, have previously been tested for association with multiple sclerosis(MS) risk.	
Despite sufficient power to detect associations at genome-wide significance thresholds across a range of ORs, our analyses did not support a role of rs429358 or rs7412 on MS susceptibility.	
Furthermore, studies of APOE rs429358,rs7412, (defining e2/e3/e4 alleles; 12 studies) and APOB rs693 (eight studies) were included in meta-analyses, the observational hazard ratio (HR) for symptomatic gallstone disease for the fifth versus first quintile of LDL-C was 0.94 (95%confidence interval: 0.76-1.17), despite a corresponding 134% increase in LDL-C .	
There were no associations between APOE polymorphisms and serum HDL-C, APO-CIII and triglycerides	
In CHC patients, genetic heterogeneity in the APOE/TOMM40 genomic region is significantly associated with variation in serum ApoE and ApoB levels, and also with fibrosis suggesting a pleiotropic attribute of this genomic region.	
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of APOE genotypes, the intake of saturated fatty acids(SFA), and obesity on serum lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population.	
APOE genotypes, SFA intake, and obesity were found to be associated with blood lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population.	
Multivariate analysis showed association between rs7856774 and LOAD, independently from the effect of APOE variation.	
Pooled DNA GWAS enabled the identification of a novel LOAD candidate risk variant, rs7856774 (9q21.33), tagging a possible genomic enhancer affecting proximal transcribed elements including DAPK1 gene.	
the minor alleles of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene SNPs rs708272 and rs1800775 were associated with higher serum TC and apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene SNP rs7412 with lower TC concentrations; CETP SNPs rs708272, rs1800775, and rs3764261 and apolipoprotein B (APOB)gene SNP rs693 with higher serum HDL-C; APOE SNP rs7412, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) gene SNP rs10865710 with lower LDL-C, and CETP SNP rs1800775 with higher LDL-C; and APOE/C1/C4/C2 cluster SNP rs35136575 with lower serum TG.	
For example, the association of polymorphisms rs1051730 and rs8034191 with lung cancer was heterogeneous between Caucasians (OR = 1.32 and 1.22; 95% CI: 1.25-1.44 and 1.05-1.42; P<0.0005 and 0.008, respectively) and East Asians (OR = 1.51 and 1.03; 95% CI: 0.76-3 and 0.47-2.27; P = 0.237 and 0.934, respectively) under theallelic model, and this association was relatively strengthened under the dominant model.	
Inside this region of 26.9 kb, LD (r2 > 0.50) between TOMM40 (rs2075650) and APOE (rs429358) was observed in bvFTD and in controls, but not in PPA	
The SIRT2 rs10410544 T allele deserves further investigation as a novel minor genetic risk factor for AD in the APOE e4-negative Caucasian population.	
There was moderate consistency between the cross-sectional and longitudinal findings, with eight SNP:BL associations consistently identified across both study designs: [APOE.2 and APOE.4 (rs7412 and rs429358)]:TC; HL/LIPC (rs2070895):HDL; [APOB (rs1367117), APOE.2 and APOE.4 (rs7412 and rs429358)]:LDL; [APOA5(rs2072560) and APOC III (rs5128)]:TG.	
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of ApoE polymorphisms did not differ between patients with RA and controls.	
In the present study, we investigated whether APOE genotype was associated with cognitive function in predominantly middle-aged persons.	
The results indicated that homozygous APOE e4 carriers aged 35 years or older had worse cognitive function than heterozygous carriers and noncarriers.	
Collectively, these results also suggest and claim for further investigations on APOE/HP interaction in other age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis and Parkinson's disease.	
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) functional haplotypes determined by rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs have been extensively studied and found to be one of the most consistent association in human longevity studies.	
CONCLUSIONS: APOE haplotypes are significantly associated with longevity in our population.	
CONCLUSIONS: Although the physiological role of   apoE in FTD and PPA needs further investigations, our results suggest an involvement of the APOE gene locus in the genetics of FTD and PPA.	
Individuals were genotyped for PCSK9 R46L (rs11591147), ABCG8 D19H (rs11887534), and APOE R112C (rs429358) and R158C (rs7412) polymorphisms, all of which are associated with lifelong reduced plasma LDL cholesterol levels.	
This paper addresses a tenet of the literature on   APOE, i.e., the relationship between the effects of the e4, one of the established genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its expression levels as determined by APOE promoter polymorphisms.	
Three SNPs (rs2568494 in IREB2, rs8034191 in LOC123688, and rs1051730 in CHRNA3) were associated with pre-bronchodilator FEV1 percent of predicted in the AAT Genetic Modifiers Study.	
Two SNPs (rs2568494 and rs1051730) were associated with the post-bronchodilator FEV1 percent of predicted and pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio; SNP-by-gender interactions were observed.	
In the UK National Registry dataset, rs2568494 was significantly associated with emphysema in the male subgroup; significant SNP-by-smoking interactions were observed.	
We investigated thecausal relationship between smoking and symptoms of anxiety and depression in the Norwegian HUNT study using the rs1051730 single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) variant located in the nicotine acetylcholine receptor gene cluster on chromosome 15 as an instrumental variable for smokingphenotypes	
Our data are compatible with the hypothesis of a complex role of   ApoE in the   AD pathogenesis, with positive and negative effects occurring concomitantly according to its expression levels and its protein-protein interactions largely unclarified.	
VKORC1 3673 AA or GA genotype (P<0.0001), one or two variant alleles of CYP2C9 gene (P=0.0004),   APOE e2 haplotype (P=0.01), and increasing age (P<0.0001) were all associated with lower warfarin dose, whereas smoking (P=0.025) and pulmonary embolism (P=0.0059) showed association with higher warfarin doses.	
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that VKORC1, CYP2C9 polymorphisms, APOE e2 variant, and several clinical/demographic variables are important determinants of warfarin dose requirements in Egyptian patients.	
CONCLUSIONS: Although   APOE genotype does have strong associations with lipid levels in childhood, there does not seem to be meaningful effects on cognitive performance, suggesting that any detrimental effects of the e4 allele on cognitive function are not important until later life.	
rs429358 alone is responsible for the association of APOE with dementia;	
CONCLUSIONS: The present study exposed a susceptibility haplotype CGTC, within   APOE gene, which was found to  be associated with BMD and risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis in postmenopausal females of India.	
BACKGROUND: The association of   apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes with bone mineral density (BMD) and risk of osteoporosis have remained unclear.	
BACKGROUND: Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the influence of several genetic variants in genes related with triglyceride (TG) metabolism has been described, including LPL,   APOA5 and   APOE.	
Among SNPs tested with an allele frequency of at least 5%, only SNPs in   apoE are found to influence statin response significantly.	
Of the 3 SNPs most significantly associated with MI, rs7412, which defines the Apo E2 isoform, was associated with both a lower Apo B/A1 ratio (P=1.0x10(-7)) and lower MI risk (P=0.0004).	
METHODS: We reviewed the literature relating to SNPs rs16969968 and rs1051730  and  smoking-related phenotypes, and clinical and preclinical studies, which shed light on the mechanisms underlying these associations	
Two polymorphisms (rs7412, rs429358) that define the epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 isoforms of apolipoprotein E were significantly associated with percent reduction in LDL-C with atorvastatin (epsilon2 carriers 53.8%, epsilon3/epsilon3 48.1%, and epsilon4 carriers 46.4%, respectively, P=0.00039) and replicated in the pravastatin arm (epsilon2 carriers 22.1%, epsilon3/epsilon3 21.8%, and epsilon4 carriers 16.6%, respectively, P=0.00038).	
Our results support the hypothesis that APOE gene variants influence the prevalence of diabetes and possibly overweight in psychiatric patients.	
These associations warrant prospective study to assess interaction between APOE gene variants and the propensity of antipsychotics to induce cardiovascular risk factors.	
Lower lipid profile values among patients, even those on lipid-rich diets associated with the   APOE*4 allele, suggest alterations in the lipid synthesis and metabolism pathways in CRC.	
GAB2 rs2373115 marker does not modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish APOE epsilon 4 carriers.	
OBJECTIVE: Although several studies have reported an association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the chromosomal region containing the Apolipoprotein E (  ApoE) gene, findings about the exact location in the ApoE gene have been inconsistent.	
The sliding window haplotype trend regression test revealed that SNP rs405509 was included in all haplotypes that are significantly associated with OSA status.	
In a clinical setting,   APOE genotyping could offer additional biological evidence of whether a subject may develop AD, but it is not robust enough to serve as an independent screening or predictive test in thediagnosis of AD	
In this study, we investigated whether variants in three key pigmentation genes-  MC1R,   MATP/SLC45A2, and   OCA2--were involved in melanoma predisposition	
MC1R and SLC45A2 variants had additive effects on melanoma risk, and after adjusting for pigmentation characteristics, the risk was persistent, even though both genes had a strong impact on pigmentation	
We conducted additional genotyping to clarify the role of the   OCA2 locus in the inheritance of eye color and other pigmentary traits associated with skin-cancer risk inwhite populations	
The minor alleles of rs7903146  T= TF(TCF7L2), rs12255372 T=TF (TCF7L2), rs1799884 (-30G/A, GCK), rs5219 (E23K,KCNJ11), rs7754840  (CDKAL1), rs4402960 (IGF2BP2), rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs1387153  (MTNR1B) and rs1801278 (Gly972Arg, IRS1) were significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM.	
Among them, genetic variants in   TCF7L2 showed the strongest association with GDM risk, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.44 (1.29-1.60, P < 0.001) per T allele of rs7903146 and 1.46 (1.15-1.84, P = 0.002) per T allele of rs12255372	
BACKGROUND: Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs1051730 and rs16969968, located within the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster on chromosome 15q25 locus, are associated with heaviness of smoking, risk for lung cancer, and other smoking-related health outcomes.	
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to replicate the association of the rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) polymorphisms of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Han Chinese people in Henan province, China.	
CONCLUSIONS: The CC genotype and the recessive model of the variant rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and CC haplotype of rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) in TCF7L2may be associated with T2DM in Han Chinese people in Henan province, China..	
Here, we report replication of association between T2D and three SNPs in the case-control (rs7901695, P=0.003; rs7901346, P=0.00002; and. rs12255372, P=0.000004) and two SNPs in the family-based  (rs7901695, P=0.01 and rs7901346, P=0.04) samples from northern Sweden.	
This 263 indel (rs67384697) is </ModMar>reported</ModMar> to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kilobases upstream of HLA-C (-35T/C; rs9264942) in Caucasian individuals, making this SNP a potential marker for both HLA-C expression and HIV-1 disease progression	
Two polymorphisms affecting HLA-Csurface expression (rs9264942 and rs67384697) have recently been identified, and shown to influence progression of HIV infection.	
OBJECTIVE: Heterozygosity for a 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene (CCR5wt/d32) and the minor alleles of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the HCP5 gene (rs2395029) and in the HLA-C gene region (-35HLA-C; rs9264942) has been associated with a lower viral load set point	
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kb upstream of HLA-C (rs9264942; termed -35) associates with control of HIV, and with levels of HLA-C messenger RNA transcripts and cell-surface expression, but the mechanism underlying its varied expression is unknown.	
RESULTS: Significant associations between the minor allele variants of SNPs HLA-C rs9264942 and HCP5 rs2395029 and a lower viral load at set point could be replicated in the ACS.	
In adiposity-matched, normal-weight humans, we showed that subjects homozygous for the FTO obesity-risk rs9939609 A allele have dysregulated circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone acyl-ghrelin and attenuated postprandial appetitereduction.	
Through an exhaustive search of pair-wise interactions and a selected search of three- to five-way interactions conditioned on significant pair-wise results, we identified 24 core SNPs in six genes(FTO: rs9939973, rs9940128, rs9922047, rs1121980, rs9939609, rs9930506; TSPAN8: rs1495377; TCF7L2: rs4074720, rs7901695, rs4506565, rs4132670, rs10787472, rs11196205, rs10885409, rs11196208; L3MBTL3: rs10485400, rs4897366; CELF4: rs2852373, rs608489; RUNX1: rs445984, rs1040328, rs990074, rs2223046, rs2834970) that appear to be important for T2D.	
The increase in cotinine levels indicated an increased risk of lung cancer with each additional copy of the rs1051730-rs16969968 risk allele 	
OBJECTIVE: We investigated if the FTO rs9939609 associates with food preferences in healthy adults with no cancer,cardiovascular disease, or diabetes.	
Conclusions:The present study demonstrated that FTO rs9939609 and combined SNPs were significantly associated with risk of hypertension, which seems to be dependent on BMI.	
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that FTO rs9939609 and combined SNPs were significantly associated with risk of hypertension, which seems to be dependent on BMI.	
METHODS: All obese patients were genotypedfor the FTO single nucleotide polimorphysm (SNP) rs9939609.	
We investigated the rs1051730 single nucleotide polymorphism in the nicotine acetylcholine receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4), associated with smoking phenotypes, to determine whether women who continued to smoke were also more likely to report a low mood during pregnancy.	
We found among women who smoked pre-pregnancy, those with the 1051730 T allele smoked more and were less likely to quit smoking during pregnancy, but were also less likely to report high levels of depressed mood at 18 weeks of pregnancy (per allele OR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.99, p = 0.034).	
The rs1051730 genetic variant within the CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster is associated with heaviness of smoking and has recently been reported to be associated with likelihood of stopping smoking.	
We investigated the potential association of rs1051730 gLLLenotype with reduced likelihood ofsmoking cessation in 2 cohorts of treatment-seeking smokers in primary care in the United Kingdom.	
There was evidence of association of rs1051730 genotype with short-term (4-week) cessation in our open-label trial sample but not our placebo-controlled trial sample.	
Moreover, the rs1051730 variant may not merely operate as a marker for dependence or heaviness of smoking.	
Nominally significant associations with candidateSNPs within cholinergic receptors, nicotinic, alpha 3/5 (CHRNA3/CHRNA5; eg, p=0.00011 for SNP rs1051730) and cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily A, polypeptide 6 (CYP2A6; eg, p=2.78*10(-5) for a non-synonymous SNP rs1801272) regions were observed for lifetime average CPD, however only CYP2A6 showed evidence of significant association with current CPD.	
A candidate SNP (rs3025343) in   DBH was significantly (p=0.015) associated withsmoking cessation.	
We examined the associations between the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor polymorphism (rs1051730) on chromosome 15q25 marking thegene cluster CHRNA3-CHRNB4-CHRNA5, smoking behavior, and tobacco-related cancer and lung and cardiovascular diseases in the general population.	
Both the T-allele of rs7903146 and the T-allele of rs12255372 significantly increase type 2 diabetes risk with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.69 (95% CI 1.55-1.83) (P = 6.0 x 10(-35)) and 1.60 (1.47-1.74) (P = 7.6 x 10(-28)), respectively.	
The rs7903146 T at-risk allele associates with decreased BMI and earlier age at diagnosis in the type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 8.0 x 10(-3) and P = 3.8 x 10(-4), respectively), which is supportedby quantitative family-based association tests.	
We genotyped four of the SNPs (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372) in Amish subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 137), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 139), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 342).	
A-allele of rs1051730 was associated with an increased risk of COPD regardless of smoking exposure (pooled OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.18-1.34, p < 10⁻⁵).	
Our findings suggest that rs1051730 in CHRNA is a susceptibility variant for COPD, in terms of both airway obstruction and parenchyma destruction.	
Recently, a microsatellite marker in intron 3 DG10S478 and five correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in Icelandic individuals that showed strong association with type 2 diabetes, which was replicated in Danish and European-American cohorts.	
We genotyped four of the SNPs (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372) in Amish subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 137), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 139), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 342).	
We compared genotype frequencies in subjects with type 2 diabetes with those with NGT and found marginal association for rs7901695 (P = 0.05; odds ratio [OR] 1.51);	
comparison between NGT control subjects and the combined type 2 diabetes/IGT case group showed strong association with rs7901695 and rs7903146 (P = 0.008-0.01; OR 1.53-1.57) and marginal association with rs11196205 and rs12255372 (P = 0.07 and P = 0.04, respectively).	
We also genotyped these SNPs in nondiabetic, non-Amish subjects (n = 48), in whom intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed, and found an association between rs7901695 and rs7903146 and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively) and disposition index (P = 0.04 and P = 0.007, respectively).	
we examined the association of a common variant of the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372 [T/G]) with type 2 diabetes risk among Caucasians.	
Over an average period of three years, participants with the risk-conferring TT genotype at rs7903146 were more likely to have progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes than were CC homozygotes (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.01; P<0.001).	
Common variants in TCF7L2 seem to be associated with an increased risk of diabetes among persons with impaired glucose tolerance.	
The SNP rs7903146 was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in the initial (p = 0.08) and two replication sample sets (p = 0.05 and 0.06).	
For the combined sample set, in which we successfully genotyped 1,174 type 2 diabetes patients and 823 control subjects, rs7903146 showed a significant association with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio = 1.69 [95% CI 1.21-2.36], p = 0.002) with the same direction as the previous reports in samples from European and European-origin populations.	
The rest of the five SNPs (rs7895340, rs11196205 and rs12255372) did not show any significant associations with type 2 diabetes.	
The consistent association between rs7903146 in TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes in different ethnic groups, including the Japanese population, suggests that TCF7L2 is a common susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes.	
The minor alleles of rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs12255372 (TCF7L2), rs1799884 (-30G/A, GCK), rs5219 (E23K,KCNJ11), rs7754840 (CDKAL1), rs4402960 (IGF2BP2), rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs1387153 (MTNR1B) and rs1801278 (Gly972Arg, IRS1) were significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM.	
In summary, by pooling all available qualified data from genetic studies on rs12255372 and T2DM, we have confirmed that rs12255372 is significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM in the global population.	
In recent years, it has been widely accepted that transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in multiple ethnic groups, especially its single nucleotide polymorphisms of rs7903146C/T, rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C.	
In conclusion, this study indicated that the rs7903146C/T polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene had a significant effect on T2DM risk in Chinese Han population, with rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C polymorphisms showing no significant effect.	
Subgroups analyses show that significant associations are not found between the six SNPs (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, rs7901695, rs7895340, and rs4506565) and the type 2 diabetes in some ethnic populations.	
The four tested TCF7L2 variants were in linkage disequilibrium, and 4-locus (rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, rs12255372) haplotype analysis demonstrated that haplotype 1111 was negatively associated (Pc<0.001), while haplotypes 2222 (Pc=0.008) and 2211 (Pc=0.020) were positively associated with T2DM risk, after controlling for a number of covariates.	
We evaluated the published evidence for association between rs16969968 (k = 27 samples) and rs1051730 (k = 44 samples) SNPs with heaviness of smoking using meta-analytic techniques.	
Meta-analysis indicated compelling evidence of an association between the rs1051730/rs16966968 variants and daily cigarette consumption (fixed effects: B = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.77, 1.06, p < .001; random effects: B = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.81, 1.22, p < .001), equivalent to a per-allele effect of approximately 1 cigarette/day.	
Among women with a history of diabetes, the TT genotype of rs3750804 increased breast cancer risk (OR, 2.46; 95 % CI 1.28-4.73)	
CONCLUSIONS: Donor TCF7L2 rs290487 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of NODM after LT and has a potential clinical value for the prediction of NODM.	
The minor T allele of TCF7L2 rs12255372 was found to significantly increase the risk of T2DM, with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.458 (95% CI 1.108-1.918, p = 0.007).	
We also found a strong correlation between the rs7903146 and the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (P = 0.02 with a high OR = 8.28).	
We conclude that rs11196236 GTCF7L2 variant is associated with peripheral insulin resistance in PCOS but this effect is not seen in control women.	
CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 rs12255372 polymorphism protects Mexican children from obesity.	
THADA variant (rs7578597) was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.04, 2.22; p = 0.03).	
If the application of TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNPs as a marker for PTDM is confirmed by further independent studies, replacing tacrolimus with other immunosuppressants could be warranted in patients at high risk of PTDM, as diagnosed by TCF7L2 genotyping.	
In addition, an association of two SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene with T2D was observed in both cities: rs7903146, (for Guerrero OR = 1.98 CI95% 1.02-3.89 and for Mexico OR = 1.94 CI95% 1.31-2.88) and rs12255372(OR = 1.79 CI95% 1.08-2.97, OR = 1.78 CI95% 1.17-2.71 respectively).	
No interaction was observed between TCF7L2 and HLA-DQB1*0602, which was shown to be negatively associated with gestational diabetes in mothers born in Sweden (P = 0.010).	
A genetic variant within the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 region (rs1051730), previously associated with smoking quantity, was recently shown to interact with smoking on obesity predisposition.	
The rs1051730 variant was not significantly associated with smoking status or snus use (P > 0.05); the T allele was associated with lower BMI in the overall cohort (b = -0.10 kg/m(2), SE = 0.05; P = 0.03) and with smoking quantity in those in whom this was measured (n = 5,304) (b = 0.08, SE = 0.01; P < 0.0001)	
The rs7903146(T) allele genotype was significantly associated with nodal involvement (P = 0.003) but rs12255372 (T) allele genotype was not associated with the clinico-pathologic characteristics.	
Thus, we have shown that the rs12255372 and rs13266634 markers are independent genetic T2D risk factors in a Russian population.	
Thus, we have shown that the rs12255372 and rs13266634 markers are independent genetic T2D risk factors in a Russian population.	
The non-synonymous rs4994 polymorphism of the ADRB3 gene was associated with T2D (Trpallele, OR = 0.62, p = 0.001) and MS (Trp allele, OR = 0.74, p = 0.018).	
BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymiorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146 and rs12255372 located within TCF7L2 gene have been identified as the strongest common genetic risk factors for development of type 2 diabetes(T2D).	
CONCLUSIONS: Although the biology of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and prior association between rs12255372 and numerous phenotypes warranted examination of this TCF7L2 SNP, no compelling evidence for association with breast or ovarian cancer was observed.	
However, the risk allele at TCF7L2 rs7903146 was more frequent in PA subjects than in controls when we restricted the analysis to the subjects with lower weight-for-height than the median of the PA subjects (	
To investigate the expression of ABCC11 (MRP8) protein in normal breast tissue, and examine the difference in ABCC11 mRNA and proteinexpression between normal breast and breast cancer tissues taking into account ABCC11 genotype (a functional SNP, rs17822931) and estrogen receptor (ER) status	
In the present study, to determine whether the SNP can serve as a diagnostic marker for axillary osmidrosis (AO), we examined genotypes at rs17822931 in 79 Japanese AO individuals.	
In Europeans, three haplotypes in the region have been shown to be associated with eye pigmentation and a missense SNP (rs1800407) has been associated with green/hazel eyes	
Our data suggest that the haplotype restricted to Europe is the strongest marker for blue eyes globally and add further inferential evidence that the derived allele of rs1800414 is an East Asian skin pigmentation allele.	
Moreover, the TT genotype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) a3-subunit (CHRNA3) rs1051730 polymorphism has previously been associated with diminished PPI and nicotine dependence.	
We found that the variant allele of OCA2 R419Q (rs1800407) was associated with increased risk of MM (	
We were also able to demonstrate the OCA2 R419Q,rs1800407, coding SNP acts as a penetrance modifier of this new HERC2 SNP for eye color, and somewhat independently, of melanoma risk.	
Conclusions: Genetic variation of DRD2, specifically the rs1799732 polymorphism, may produce an earlier clinical presentation of Wilson disease neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs that occur in the course of dopaminergic system impairment due to copper accumulation in the brain.	
We investigated the relationship between withdrawal syndrome symptoms and dopamine receptor 2 DRD2 gene polymorphisms-141 C I/D (rs1799732) exon 8 G/A (rs6276) and ANKK1 (Ankyrin Repeat and Kinase Domain Containing 1) gene polymorphism Taq1A (rs1800497)	
These results strongly suggested that A1+ variants of the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A allele do confer an associated risk for akathisia inpatients who were treated with SGAs, and these variants may explain inconsistencies found across prior studies, when comparing FGAs and SGAs.	
Eleven tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PRCP gene and four tag SNPs and G-1903A rs1800875 polymorphism in the CMA1 gene were genotyped in the Chinese Han population (n=1020) using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method	
CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicated PRCP rs7104980 can be considered as a marker for EH and Hap3 GAGCACTAACA (PRCP) and Hap16 TTTA (CMA1) might be associated with EH in Chinese Han population.	
Previous studies have indicated that CMA1 promoter polymorphism rs1800875 may be involved in regulating immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in patients with eczema, and it is associated with the progression of immunoglobulin A nephropathy.	
Polymorphism rs1800875 of CMA1 may be associated with serum IgE level in CHD subjects, but not with chymase level in both groups.	
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the CMA rs1800875 polymorphism is associated with the progression of IgAN inKorean patients.	
In the LEUVEN cohort, rs1051730 AA-carriers and rs8034191 GG-carriers had a two-fold increased risk to suffer from COPD GOLD IV (	
CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm previous observations of a significant association between the CMA1 promoter polymorphism rs1800875 and atopic eczema, but not with serum IgE levels, and support the hypothesis that CMA1 serves as candidate gene for atopic eczema.	
The increased risk of brain tumors was evident for CYP1A1 rs2606345 (P = 0.0028; OR = 2.06; 95 % CI, 1.27-3.34) and minor haplotypes rs2606345-rs1048943-rs4646903 in females (global haplotypeassociation P value, 0.0011).	
Only STK39 rs3754777 was significantly associated with higher DBP (P = 0.02) in the overweight subjects.	
The association between C677T and cervical cancer susceptibility has been widely studied.	
CONCLUSIONS: C677T polymorphism of MTHFR gene may increase the risk of cervical cancer in the complete over-dominant model.	
The ACTN3 R577X (rs1815739) polymorphism determines the presence or absence of functional ACTN3, which may influence the extent of exercise-induced muscle damage.	
We conclude that HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism by itself is not critical in determining sprint performance.	
To best of our knowledge, we first screened these variants known to be associated with neurodegeneration disease, E46K (rs104893875) in SNCA, A1442P in LRRK2,  IVS9 in PARK2, A350V in SLC41A1, P268S rs2066842, R702W rs2066844, G908R (rs2066845), 1007fs (rs2066847) in NOD2 and G2385R (rs34778348) in LRRK2 from southern China population.	
Colonic lesions were positively associated with the risk alleles of IL23R rs11209026 (OR = 2.25 [1.13-4.51]) and 6q21 rs7746082 (OR = 1.60 [1.10-2.34] and negatively associated with the risk alleles of IRGM rs13361189 (OR = 0.29 [0.11-0.74]) and DEFB1 rs11362 (OR = 0.50 [0.30-0.80]).	
In genotype-association SNP analysis, all NOD2 SNPs (rs5743293, rs2066844, rs2066845) and the IL23r SNP (rs11465804) showed a significant association to IBD (p < 0.03).	
Three NOD2/CARD15 variants, namely two missense polymorphisms R702W rs2066844 and G908R rs2066845, and a frame shift polymorphism L1007fs rs2066847, were associated with CD in Caucasian populations.	
Our analysis revealed that effects of two linked variants(rs1051730 and rs8034191) in the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 cluster on   COPD development are significantly, yet not entirely, mediated by the smoking-related phenotypes	
In association analysis, we found statistically significant association of L1007fs (p =0.001, OR=3.011, CI95%=1.494-6.071) and G908R (p=2.62 * 10<formula>^{-4}</formula>, OR=14.117, CI95%= 1.884-105.799) polymorphisms with CD patients.	
Whereas the NOD2 genotype and smoking are positively associated with ileal (L1 + L3) disease, the TNFSF15 genotype is positively associated with isolated colonic (L2) disease.	
The association between the Serine/threonine kinase 15 (STK15) F31I polymorphism (rs2273535) and cancer susceptibility remains controversial.	
Stratified analysis by cancer type revealed that the STK rs2273535 polymorphism may contribute to the risk of breast cancer (AA vs. TT: OR=1.21, 95%CI=1.01-1.44, Pheterogeneity=0.002), colorectal cancer (AA vs. UNASSIGNED: OR=1.24, 95%CI=1.05-1.47, Pheterogeneity=0.124), and esophageal cancer (AA vs. UNASSIGNED: OR=1.19, 95%CI=1.02-1.39, Pheterogeneity=0.148)	
The results showed that four SNPs in AURKA (data in recessive model, rs2273535: OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.03-4.66, p = 0.0422; rs2298016: OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.18-0.82, p = 0.0141; rs6024836: OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.18-2.00, p = 0.0014; rs10485805: OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.47-0.98, p = 0.0380) and one SNP in BRCA1(rs3737559, dominant model OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.11-1.64, p = 0.0030) were associated with breast cancer susceptibility.	
METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA (rs2273535), ERBB2 (rs1136201), MDM2 (rs2279744), CDH1 (rs5030625), CDKN2A (rs11515), and TP73 (rs2273953) genes were genotyped in a consecutive cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients, who had underwent surgical resection with curative intent.	
However, in a multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.45-0.88]).	
In addition, higher frequencies of the MMP1 rs1799750 2G allele (p = 0.017, OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.06-2.08) and the MMP1/MMP3 rs1799750/rs679620 2G/G haplotype (OR 1.45, 95%CI 1.01-2.10) were detected in sporadic RCC patients than in controls (n = 295).	
The presence of the variant allele TNFA c.-238A (rs361525) was associated with lower serum levels of TNF-a, and with significantly decreased risk of SBI in both cohorts.	
BACKGROUND: Evidence has suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a may be involved in the aetiology of psoriasis, but the underlying association of the TNF-a polymorphisms -238G/A (rs361525) and -308G/A (rs1800629) with the risk of psoriasis is still unconfirmed.	
RESULTS: Risk alleles previously associated with smoking heaviness were significantly (P<0.05) associated with reduced abstinence in the PLA pharmacotherapy group (PG) at 6MO [for rs588765, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.41 (0.17-0.99)], and at end of treatment and at 6MO [for rs1051730, 0.42 (0.19-0.93) and 0.31 (0.12-0.80)], and with increased abstinence in the NRT PG at 6MO [for rs588765, 2.07 (1.11-3.87) and for rs1051730, 2.54 (1.29-4.99)]	
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the   TNF-a -238 and -308 promoter polymorphisms may play different roles in conferring susceptibility to psoriasis.	
We genotyped and analyzed 4 SNPs in 3 genes: PTPN22 C1858T (rs2476601), TNFA G-308A, G-238A (rs1800629, rs361525) and MIF G-173C (rs755622) in 647 JIA cases and 751 healthy controls.	
CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed associations between JIA and PTPN22 and TNFA G-308A.	
CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-a -857C>T genotype was found to be predictive of clinical response and was more likely to predict long-term survival in Japanese ESCC patients receiving definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based CRT.	
RESULTS: Alcoholic cirrhotics compared to healthy individuals demonstrated a statistically significant increase in PNPLA3 (10109G) allele (p = 0.037, OR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.29-3.4).	
RESULTS: Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in   ABCA7 (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 * 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 < D' < 0.9).	
Genotyping was performed for five single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been associated with cognitive performance: APOE rs429358, COMT rs4680, BDNF rs6265, KIBRA rs17070145, and CLSTN2 (rs6439886).	
Three SNPs[rs429358 in APOE: odds ratio (OR)=4.24, 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.01-5.96, P=1.23*10; rs2075650 in APOE: OR=3.57, 95% CI=2.51-5.06, P=1.23*10; and rs677909 in PICALM: OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.49-0.81, P=0.00036, log additive model] were significantly associated with AD susceptibility after correction for multiple testing.	
BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs429358 (e4) and rs7412 (e2), both invoking changes in the amino-acid sequence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, have previously been tested for association with multiple sclerosis (MS) risk.	
RESULTS: Despite sufficient power to detect associations at genome-wide significance thresholds across a range of ORs, our analyses did not support a role of rs429358 or rs7412 on MS susceptibility	
The distributions of SNPs relating to the amyloid cascade hypothesis (TOMM40 rs157581 G and TOMM40 rs2075650 G), to the cholesterol metabolism hypothesis (ApoE rs429358 C, LDLR rs11668477 G and CH25H rs7091822 T and PLAU rs2227564 CT) and to the tau hypothesis (MAPT/STH rs242562 GG) in aMCI were significantly different than those in normal controls.	
The authors then performed a large meta-analysis of 36 studies examining the association of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene in various ethnicities, containing rs7903146 C-to-T (IVS3C>T), rs7901695 T-to-C (IVS3T>C), a rs12255372 G-to-T (IVS4G>T), and rs11196205 G-to-C (IVS4G>C) polymorphisms and toevaluate the size of gene effect and the possible genetic mode of action	
Carbohydrate quality and quantity modified risk of T2D associated with   TCF7L2, which suggests that changes in risk attributable to the TCF7L2 variant are magnified under conditions of increased insulin demand.	
We genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 (previously associated with type 2 diabetes) and rs10885406 and rs7924080 (which tag haplotype A [HapA], a haplotype reported to be associated with obesity) in 2,512 FHS participants.	
As expected, the T risk allele of rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.01).	
There was no association of HapA with BMI (p = 0.98), waist circumference (p = 0.89), subcutaneous adipose tissue (p = 0.32) or visceral adipose tissue (p = 0.92).	
We confirmed that the risk allele of rs7903146 is associated with hyperglycaemia and a higher proinsulin/insulin ratio.	
We did not detect any association of the TCF7L2 HapA with adiposity measures,	
We investigated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs7903146 and rs12255372, within the TCF7L2 locus on postprandial lipemia and other MetS-related traits and their modulation by dietary fat.	
In summary, high (n-6) PUFA intakes (> or = 6.62% of energy intake) were associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia in carriers of the minor T allele at the TCF7L2rs7903146 SNP and may predispose them to MetS, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.	
We found that SNPs rs7901695, rs4506565, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene were strongly associated with T2D (p<0.004).	
In rs7903146, T2D patients carrying genotypes CT or TT had higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (p=0.042) and lower HOMA-beta index (p=0.015) and BMI (p=0.015) compared to the patients carrying CC genotype.	
Furthermore, the risk alleles from TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism either with IDErs2251101 polymorphism (p=0.0257, OR=1.398) or with HHEX rs1544210 polymorphism (p=0.0024, OR=1.514) were significantly associated with T2D.	
The allele and genotype frequencies of two SNP srs12255372 and rs7903146 showed that these are associated (odds ratio up to 4) with the development of diabetes in the autoantibody-negative diabetic cohort, but not in the autoantibody-positive diabetic cohort.	
In our case-control subjects, susceptibility to type 2 diabetes was replicated in TCF7L2 rs12255372, CDKAL1 rs7756992, rs7754840, HHEX (rs7923837), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960 and rs1470579), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), and SLC30A8 (rs13266634).	
In addition to these polymorphisms, meta-analysis confirmed the association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility with KCNJ11 rs5219, TCF7L2 rs7903146, and HHEX rs1111875.	
The TCF7L2 rs12255372 polymorphism showed the highest odds ratio (OR) for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.714 [1.298-2.263]).	
Odds ratio of other polymorphisms ranged from 1.13 to 1.41. The risk allele of CDKAL1 rs7756992 was significantly associated with lower insulin levels in type 2 diabetic patients after adjustment for other confounding factors.	
Compared with controls (men and women combined), GDM was associated with rs7756992 and rs7754840 (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, p = 4.17 x 10(-9)) in CDKAL1; rs10811661 (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.29-1.72, p = 1.05 x 10(-7)) in the CDKN2A-CDKN2B region; rs1111875 (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.49, p = 0.003), rs5015480, and rs7923837 in HHEX; rs4402960 (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.38, p = 0.03) in IGF2BP2; rs13266634 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.43, p = 0.005) in SLC30A8; and rs7903146 (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03-2.43, p = 0.038) in TCF7L2.	
The risk alleles of the SNPs rs7756992 and rs7754840 in CDKAL1; rs10811661 in the CDKN2A-CDKN2B region; and rs1111875, rs5015480 and rs7923837 in HHEX were associated with significant decreases in the insulin AUC during a 100 g OGTT performed at the time of diagnosis of GDM.	
The risk alleles of the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372 and rs7903146) were strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, even after controlling for traditional risk factors in both a cross-sectional and prospective setting.	
The minor allele frequency of rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with that in non-diabetic individuals.	
The T (minor) allele of the variant rs7903146 was significantly associated with a greater OR for type 2 diabetes adjusted for age, sex and BMI in logistic regression analysis:	
No statistically significant association of the SNPs was observed with TCP or FCPD or between carriers and non-carriers of N34S SPINK1 and L26V CTSB mutations.	
while, TCF7L2variant showed a statistically significant association between TCP and FCPD patients carrying the 26V allele (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.11-2.56, P = 0.013).	
The rs7903146 and rs12255372 variants of TCF7L2 have been strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in most populations studied to date.	
Comparison between allele and genotype frequencies of these SNPs in patients and controls showed marginal association for rs7903146 and rs290487 with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.063, OR 1.982, 95% CI 1.128-3.485; p = 0.071, OR 1.237, 95% CI 0.983-1.557, respectively).	
No association was found for rs12255372, rs3814573, c.1,637C>A and type 2 diabetes (p = 0.278-1.000).	
We evaluated  the association of a polymorphism in TCF7L2 RS12255372 in the WNT signaling pathway, which previously has been strongly associated with risk of Type II Diabetes, with colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma in the prospective Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Health ProfessionalsFollow-up Study (HPFS) cohorts.	
Overall, in the NHS and HPFS, there was suggestive evidence for an inverse association associated with homozygosity for the minor allele of RS12255372 (TCF7L2 TT) and CRC (conditional and covariate adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.37-1.08; P for heterogeneity 0.52 for the association in women and men).	
This result suggests that the increased health risk associated with rs7903146 genotype is specific to diabetes.	
Specifically, the same risk allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12255372 that is associated with diabetes (T allele) has recently been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.	
The minor allele of each variant was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes; the greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146, with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11 - 1.56, p = 1.96 x 10(-3)).	
Diabetes disease stage was marginally significantly associated with the frequency of the T variant at rs12255372 (p=0.057; adjusted p=0.017) but not at rs7903146 (p=0.5; adjusted p=0.2).	
Comparison between subjects with normal glucose and the combined DM/pre-diabetes showed a significant association with rs12255372 (OR 1.47, CI 1.04-2.08; p=0.03) but not with rs7903146 (OR 1.16, CI 0.81-1.64; p=0.4).	
These data suggest that TCF7L2 variants are associated with increased risk for DM in Emirati subjects.	
The minor alleles of rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372 showed significant associations with type 2 diabetes (OR=1.48, P=2.7 x 10(-4); OR=1.39, P=4.6 x 10(-4); OR=1.70, P=9.8 x 10(-5), respectively) in the combined sample sets,However, neither rs11196218 nor rs290487 showed a significant association.	
Significant evidence for association was observed for high TG for the T alleles of rs7903146 and rs12255372 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01) in Mexican FCHL families,No evidence for association was observed for FCHL, TC, ApoB or glucose in Mexicans.	
When testing rs7903146 and rs12255372 for replication in Finnish FCHL families, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with TG (p = 0.01 and p = 0.007).	
These data show that rs7903146 and rs12255372 are significantly associated with high TG in FCHL families from two different populations.	
These data suggest that the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic variation is associated with an increased risk of PTDM in renal allograft recipients.	
One representative variant, rs1225404, was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in a general model (additive P = 0.03, dominant P = 0.005) but not in a within-family analysis (additive P = 0.2, dominant P = 0.07).	
However, several variants were associated with BMI; in particular, rs12255372 was associated in both general and within-family analyses (both P = 0.0007).	
There was no association between rs7903146 and PCOS in the UK case-control study (Cochran-Armitage test, p = 0.51); nor with symptomatic status in the Finnish cohort (p = 0.36).	
In addition, there were no relationships between the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 and androgen levels (UK cases, p = 0.99; Finnish controls, p = 0.57; Finnish symptomatic cases, p = 0.80).	
The frequency of the T allele of both rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms was significantly higher in diabetic subjects (23% and 33%) compared to that in normal glucose-tolerant subjects (19% and 28%; P = .001 and P = .0001, respectively).	
Normal glucose-tolerant subjects with the TT genotype of rs12255372(G/T) had significantly higher  2-hour plasma glucose levels (mean +/- SD, 6.1 +/- 1.4 mmol/L) than those with the GG genotype (5.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P = .011).	
Normal glucose-tolerant subjects with the TT genotype of rs7903146(C/T) polymorphism had significantly higher 2-hour plasma glucose levels (mean +/- SD, 6.0 +/- 1.3 mmol/L) than those with the CC genotype (5.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P = .004).	
In conclusion, the T allele of the rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms of TCF7L2 gene confer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indians.	
The CT/TT genotypes of SNP rs7903146 strongly predicted future T2D in 2 independent cohorts (Swedish and Finnish).	
These results extend previous observations to other ethnic groups, and strongly confirm that   TCF7L2 genotype is a major risk factor for development of T2D.	
However, GLP-1-infusion combined with a hyperglycaemic clamp showed a significant reduction in GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in carriers of the risk allele in two variants ( rs7903146 , rs12255372 , p < 0.02),	
we analysed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7903146 and rs12255372, in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), which are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.	
Both TCF7L2 SNPs ( rs7903146 and rs12255372)were found to be significantly associated with plasma proinsulin when adjusting for insulin sensitivity, both in the whole cohort and when the diabetic subjects were excluded.	
The most significant associations were observed with TCF7L2 intron 3 SNPs rs7903146 (additive P = 4.10 x 10(-6), odds ratio [OR] 1.51; admixture-adjusted P(a) = 3.77 x 10(-6)) and rs7901695 (P = 0.001, OR 1.30; P(a) = 0.003), The 2-SNP haplotype containing these SNPs was also associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 3 x 10(-5))	
The previously reported SNPs rs7903146 T- and rs12255372 T-alleles of the TCF7L2 gene were rare and were not associated with type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population, which may attribute to the low frequencies of these two SNPs.	
SNP rs290487 located in an LD block close to the 3' end of the gene was associated with type 2 diabetes (allele-specific P = 0.0021; permuted P = 0.03).	
We studied the effect of TCF7L2  rs12255372 and   rs7903146  genotypes on glycemic response	
We observed a significant association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12255372 and the microsatellite DG10S478 with T2D in the Mexican sample	
The SNP rs7903146 shows similar trends, but its association with T2D is not as strong (OR = 1.39, p = 0.152).	
In the DPS, the TT genotype of rs12255372 was significantly associated with an adjusted 2.85-fold risk (95% CI 1.17-6.95, p = 0.021) of incident diabetes in the control group, but not in the intervention group.	
The T allele of rs12255372 was significantly associated with decreased insulin secretion (Studies II, III).	
The variant of rs12255372 of TCF7L2 was associated with incident type 2 diabetes in the DPS and in a separate population-based cross-sectional study.	
We genotyped 6,516 participants for rs12255372 and  rs7903146 and analysed the role in type 2 diabetes susceptibility using binary logistic regression. Age, sex and obesity status were examined as covariates	
RESULTS: All investigated polymorphisms were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes, and rs12255372 showed the strongest association (T vs G, chi2 = 9.20, p = 0.0024, odds ratio = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.20-2.41),	
However, rs12255372 showed association with 30' Deltainsulin (OGTT 30' min fasting insulin) in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.027).	
rs12255372 also showed an association with beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance based on 30' Deltainsulin in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.014).	
rs12255372 was also associated with GDM (odds ratio [OR] 2.49 [95% CI 1.17-5.31]; P = 0.018) in our case-control sample.	
We observed nominal association between four SNPs (rs10885390, rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs3814573) in three haplotype blocks and type 2 diabetes, age at diagnosis, and 2-h glucose levels (P = 0.001-0.055).
