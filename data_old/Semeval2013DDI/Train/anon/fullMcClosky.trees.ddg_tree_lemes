metabolism of drug0 be mainly hepatic . 
caution be recommend in patient with hepatic impairment . 
renal impairment there be currently no clinical study with drug0 in patient with impaired renal function -lrb- clinical study have exclude patient with serum creatinine concentration 0 time the upper limit of the normal range -rrb- . 
drug0 and its metabolite be minimally excrete via the kidney . 
since the renal excretion of unchanged drug0 and its metabolite be 0 % , a decrease in total body clearance be not expect in patient with renal insufficiency . 
drug interaction study have not be performed with drug0 . 
no formal drug-drug interaction study have be performed . 
no confirm interaction have be report between drug0 and other drug 
drug0 inhalation aerosol have be use concomitantly with other drug , include drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 , commonly use in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 
with the exception of drug0 , there be no formal study fully evaluate the interaction effect of drug0 inhalation aerosol and these drug with respect to effectiveness . 
drug0 : although drug0 be minimally absorb into the systemic circulation , there be some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly use drug0 . 
caution be therefore advise in the coadministration of drug0 inhalation aerosol with other drug0 -containing drug . 
concomitant treatment with drug0 -lrb- eg , rt-pa or drug0 -rrb- may : - increase the risk of bleeding complication - considerably enhance the effect of drug0 on aptt prolongation 
concomitant treatment with drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and drug that affect platelet function may also increase the risk of bleeding . 
co-administration of drug0 at steady-state with a single dose of drug0 . 
co-administration of drug0 at steady-state with a single dose of drug0 -lrb- 0 x 0 mg tablet -rrb- result in increase drug0 serum concentration . 
although a dose adjustment of drug0 be not recommend when administer in combination with drug0 , close monitoring for known side effect of drug0 , such as liver enzyme abnormality and hearing impairment , be warrant . 
drug0 do not affect the prothrombin time response to a single dose of drug0 . 
however , prudent medical practice dictate careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patient treat with drug0 and drug0 concomitantly . 
concurrent use of drug0 and drug0 in clinical practice have be associate with increase anticoagulant effect . 
drug interaction study be performed with drug0 and other drug likely to be co-administered . 
when use in therapeutic dose , drug0 have a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -lrb- intravenous and oral -rrb- , drug0 , drug0 / drug0 or drug0 .

interaction with the drug list below have not be report in clinical trial with drug0 ; 
however , no specific drug interaction study have be performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction . 
nonetheless , they have be observe with drug0 . 
until far datum be develop regard drug interaction when drug0 and these drug be use concomitantly , careful monitoring of patient be advised : drug0 elevate drug0 concentration . 
drug0 or drug0 acute ergot toxicity characterize by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia . 
drug0 , drug0 and drug0 concentration . 
laboratory test interaction there be no report laboratory test interaction . 
repeat treatment study evaluate the use of repeated course of drug0 have not be conduct . 
oral drug0 : drug0 appear to increase catabolism of vitamin k-dependent clotting factor . 
if oral drug0 be also be give , compensatory increase in clotting factor synthesis be impair . 
patient stabilize on oral drug0 who be find to require drug0 replacement therapy should be watch very closely when thyroid be start . 
if a patient be truly hypothyroid , it be likely that a reduction in drug0 dosage will be require . 
no special precaution appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy be begin in a patient already stabilize on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug0 or oral drug0 : initiate thyroid replacement therapy may cause increase in drug0 or oral drug0 requirement . 
the effect see be poorly understand and depend upon a variety of factor such as dose and type of drug0 and endocrine status of the patient . 
patient receive drug0 or oral drug0 should be closely watch during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug0 : drug0 bind both drug0 and drug0 in the intestine , thus impair absorption of these drug0 . 
in vitro study indicate that the binding be not easily remove . 
therefore , 0 to 0 hour should elapse between administration of drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 , oral drug0 : drug0 tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin -lrb- tbg -rrb- . 
in a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who be receive thyroid replacement therapy , free drug0 may be decrease when drug0 be start thus increase drug0 requirement . 
however , if the patient thyroid gland have sufficient function , the decrease free drug0 e will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine output by the thyroid . 
therefore , patient without a function drug0 gland who be on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if drug0 or drug0 -containing oral drug0 be give . 
drug0 : use of drug0 with drug0 and other drug0 may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmia have be observe . 
drug0 activity may also be enhance . 
drug0 : drug0 may potentiate the toxic effect of drug0 . 
thyroid hormonal replacement increase metabolic rate , which require an increase in drug0 dosage . 
drug0 : when administer to patient on a drug0 , this parenteral drug0 may cause hypertension and tachycardia . 
use with caution and be prepare to treat hypertension , if necessary . 
drug0 s : drug0 increase the adrenergic effect of catecholamine such as drug0 and drug0 . 
therefore , injection of these agent into patient receive drug0 increase the risk of precipitate coronary insufficiency especially in patient with coronary artery disease . 
careful observation be require . 
drug/laboratory test interaction the following drug or moiety be know to interfere with laboratory test performed in patient on drug0 therapy : drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , oral drug0 containing drug0 , drug0 -containing preparation and the numerous preparation contain drug0 . 
- change in tbg concentration should be take into consideration in the interpretation of t0 and t0 value . 
in such case , the unbound -lrb- free -rrb- hormone should be measure . 
pregnancy drug0 and drug0 -containing oral drug0 increase tbg concentration . 
tbg may also be increase during infectious hepatitis . 
decrease in tbg concentration be observe in nephrosis , acromegaly and after drug0 or drug0 therapy . 
familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine-binding-globulinemias have be describe . 
the incidence of tbg deficiency approximate 0 in 0 . 
the binding of thyroxine by thyroxine-binding prealbumin -lrb- tbpa -rrb- be inhibit by drug0 
. 
- medicinal or dietary drug0 interfere with all in vivo test of radio-iodine uptake produce low uptake which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone synthesis 
. 
- the persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicate either poor patient compliance , poor absorption , excessive fecal loss , or inactivity of the preparation . 
intracellular resistance to drug0 be quite rare . 
drug0 injection and drug0 should not be administer simultaneously because both drug be direct cardiac stimulant and their combined effect may induce serious arrhythmia . 
the drug may , however , be administer alternately provided a proper interval have elapse between dose . 
drug0 should be use with caution , if at all , when potent inhalational drug0 such as drug0 be employ because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effect of drug0 . 
take drug0 after drinking drug0 may worsen side effect and may cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse . 
in vitro mixing of an drug0 with beta-lactamtype drug0 -lrb- drug0 or drug0 -rrb- may result in a significant mutual inactivation . 
even when an drug0 and a drug0 -type drug be administer separately by different route , a reduction in drug0 serum half-life or serum level have be report in patient with impaired renal function and in some patient with normal renal function . 
usually , such inactivation of the drug0 be clinically significant only in patient with severely impaired renal function . . 
see 
no formal drug interaction study have be conduct . 
the effect of drug0 may be potentiate by drug0 which inhibit the metabolism of drug0 . 
the pressor effect of drug0 and other drug0 can combine to cause dangerous hypertension . 
administration of 0-mg/kg -lrb- 0 x ed0 -rrb- drug0 at 0 % or 0 % recovery follow an intubating dose of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- produce 0 % neuromuscular block . 
the time to onset of maximum block follow drug0 be approximately 0 minute fast with prior administration of drug0 . 
prior administration of drug0 have no effect on the duration of neuromuscular block follow initial or maintenance bolus dose of drug0 . 
infusion requirement of drug0 in patient administer drug0 prior to infusion of drug0 be comparable to or slightly great than when drug0 be not administer . 
the use of drug0 before drug0 to attenuate some of the side effect of drug0 have not be study . 
although not study systematically in clinical trial , no drug interaction be observe when drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 be administer follow vary degree of recovery from single dose or infusion of drug0 . 
drug0 or drug0 administer with drug0 / drug0 to achieve 0 mac -lsb-minimum alveolar concentration -rsb- may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance dose of drug0 and decrease the required infusion rate of drug0 . 
the magnitude of these effect may depend on the duration of administration of the volatile agent . 
#crd# to 0 minute of exposure to 0 mac drug0 or drug0 have minimal effect on the duration of action of initial dose of drug0 and therefore , no adjustment to the initial dose should be necessary when drug0 be administer shortly after initiation of volatile agent . 
in long surgical procedure during drug0 or drug0 anesthesia , less frequent maintenance dosing , low maintenance dose , or reduce infusion rate of drug0 may be necessary . 
the average infusion rate requirement may be decrease by as much as 0 % to 0 % . 
in clinical study drug0 have no effect on the duration of action or dosing requirement for drug0 . 
other drug which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of drug0 such as drug0 include certain drug0 -lrb- e. g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -rrb- , drug0 salt , drug0 , local drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of drug0 have be demonstrate in patient chronically administer drug0 or drug0 . 
while the effect of chronic drug0 or drug0 therapy on the action of drug0 be unknown , slightly short duration of neuromuscular block may be anticipate and infusion rate requirement may be high . 
drug/laboratory test interaction none know . 
in clinical study , drug0 have be co-administered with other anti-asthma medication , include inhaled and oral drug0 , and inhaled drug0 , with no evidence of increase frequency of adverse event or laboratory abnormality . 
no formal drug-drug interaction study , however , have be conduct . 
drug0 can interact with drug0 or other drug0 -lrb- may potentiate the cns depressant effect of either these medication or drug0 -rrb- , drug0 or other medication with anticholinergic activity -lrb- anticholinergic effect may be potentiate when these medication be use concurrently with drug0 -rrb- , and drug0 -lrb- concurrent use with drug0 may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and cns depressant effect of drug0 -rrb- . 
drug0 such as drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- , and drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- : use these medicine with drug0 may increase the chance of side effect . 
addition or deletion of any drug from the therapeutic regimen of patient receive oral drug0 may affect patient response to the drug0 . 
frequent determination of prothrombin time and close monitoring of the patient be essential to ascertain when adjustment of dosage of drug0 may be need . 
because of the variability of individual patient response , multiple interact mechanism with some drug , the dependency of the extent of the interaction on the dosage and duration of therapy , and the possible administration of several interact drug simultaneously , it be difficult to predict the direction and degree of the ultimate effect of concomitant medication on drug0 response . 
for example , since drug0 may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of both the oral drug0 and drug0 , the net effect be unpredictable . 
drug0 may cause an increase prothrombin response by displace the drug0 from protein binding site or a diminish prothrombin response through increase metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction , thus lead to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect . 
an interact drug which lead to a decrease in prothrombin time necessitate an increase dose of oral drug0 to maintain an adequate degree of anticoagulation may , if abruptly discontinue , increase the risk of subsequent bleeding .

potential drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 interaction 
drug0 , drug0 and drug0 be all metabolize by the cytochrome p0iiia0 isozyme , and it have be demonstrate that drug0 , a potent inhibitor of iiia0 , block the metabolism of these drug , result in increase plasma concentration of parent drug . 
increase plasma concentration of drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 cause qt prolongation and have be associate with torsades de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia , sometimes fatal . 
as note below , a sub- for drug0 in combination with drug0 , a drug that be know to be metabolize by the iiia0 isozyme . 
although it have not be definitively demonstrate that drug0 be a potent iiia0 inhibitor , it be likely to be , given the substantial interaction of drug0 with drug0 . 
consequently , it be recommend that drug0 not be use in combination with either drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 . 
other potentially important drug interaction : drug0 : drug0 metabolize by hepatic oxidation -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 elc. -rrb- should be use with caution because the clearance of these drug be likely to be reduce by drug0 . 
the clearance of drug0 metabolized by glucuronidation -lrb- e. g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- be unlikely to be affect by drug0 . 
drug0 : when drug0 -lrb- 0 mg qd -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- 0 mg q.d. be co-administered to steady state , plasma concentration and other pharmacokinetics parameter -lrb- auc , cmax , t0 , -rrb- of drug0 be approximately twice those observe when drug0 be administer alone ; 
oral clearance be reduce by about 0 % . 
the elevated plasma drug0 concentration result in decrease psychomotor performance and memory . 
this interaction , which have not be investigate use high dose of drug0 , may be more pronounced if a 0 mg daily dose be co-administered , particularly since drug0 exhibit non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 0 mg. if drug0 be co-administered with drug0 tablet , the initial drug0 dosage should be at least halve and titration to the low effective dose be recommend . 
no dosage adjustment be require for drug0 tablet . 
drug0 : the co-administration of drug0 tablet and drug0 be generally not advisable . 
because drug0 reduce the clearance of both drug0 and its active metabolite , drug0 , there be a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic co-administration . 
evidence support the conclusion that it be inadvisable to co-administer drug0 and drug0 be derive from a study in which healthy volunteer take 0 mg/day of drug0 be administer a single oral dose of 0 mg of drug0 . 
in these subject -lrb- r= b -rrb- , the clearance of drug0 be reduce by 0 % and that of drug0 to a level that be too low to measure over the course of the 0 week long study . 
it be likely that experience significantly underestimate the degree of accumulation that might occur with repealed drug0 administration . 
moreover , as note with drug0 , the effect of drug0 may even be more pronounced when it be administer at high dose . 
accordingly , drug0 and drug0 should not ordinarily be co-administered . 
drug0 : the effect of steady-state drug0 l0 mg bid on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg -rrb- as 0 mg drug0 be evaluate in 0 healthy non-smoking , male volunteer . 
the clearance of drug0 be decrease approximately 0-fold . 
therefore , if drug0 be co-administered with drug0 , its dose should be reduce to #crd# #ord# of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentration of drug0 should to monitor . 
no dosage adjustment be require for drug0 tablet . 
drug0 : when drug0 -lrb- 0 mg tid -rrb- be administer concomitantly with drug0 for #crd# week , drug0 plasma concentration increase by 0 % and prothrombin time be prolonged . 
thus patient receive oral drug0 and drug0 tablet should have their prothrombin time monitor and their drug0 dose adjust accordingly . 
no dosage adjustment be require for drug0 tablet . 
in occasional susceptible patient or in those receive drug0 -lrb- include antiparkinsonism agent -rrb- in addition , the atropine-like effect may become more pronounced -lrb- e.g. , paralytic ileus -rrb- . 
close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage be require when this drug be administer concomitantly with drug0 . 
avoid the use of preparation such as drug0 and local drug0 which contain any drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , since it have be report that drug0 can potentiate the effect of catecholamine . 
caution should be exercise when drug0 be use with agent that low blood pressure . 
drug0 may potentiate the effect of drug0 . 
the plasma concentration of drug0 may increase when the drug be give concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducer -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , and adjustment of the dosage of drug0 may therefore be necessary . 
drug metabolize by p0 0d0 the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome p0 0d0 -lrb- debrisoquin hydroxylase -rrb- be reduce in a subset of the caucasian population -lrb- about 0 to 0 % of caucasian be so call poor metabolizers -rrb- ; 
reliable estimate of the prevalence of reduce p0 0d0 isozyme activity among asian , african and other population be not yet available . 
poor metabolizers have high than expect plasma concentration of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- when give usual dose . 
depend on the fraction of drug metabolize by p0 0d0 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large -lrb- 0-fold increase in plasma auc of the drug0 -rrb- . 
in addition , certain drug inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble p.o. 
metabolizers . 
an individual who be stable on a given dose of drug0 may become abruptly toxic when give #crd# of these inhibiting drug as concomitant therapy . 
the drug that inhibit cytochrome p0 0d0 include some that be not metabolize by the enzyme -lrb- drug0 ; 
drug0 -rrb- and many that be substrate for p0 0d0 -lrb- many other drug0 , drug0 , and the drug0 drug0 and drug0 -rrb- . 
while all the drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , e. g. , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 , inhibit p0 0d0 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
the extent to which drug0 - drug0 interaction may pose clinical problem will depend on the degree of inhibition , and the pharmacokinetics of the drug0 involve . 
nevertheless , caution be indicate in the co-administration of tca0 with any of the drug0 and also in switching from #crd# class to the other . 
of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiate tca treatment in a patient be withdraw from drug0 , give the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite -lrb- at least 0 week may be necessary -rrb- . 
concomitant use of drug0 with drug that can inhibit cytochrome p0 0d0 may require low dose than usually prescribe for either the drug0 or the other drug . 
furthermore , whenever #crd# of these other drug be withdraw from cotherapy , an increase dose of drug0 may be require . 
it be desirable to monitor drug0 plasma level whenever a drug0 be going to be co-administered with another drug know to be an inhibitor of p0 0d0 . 
drug0 , drug0 , metal cation , drug0 drug0 form chelate with alkaline earth and transition metal cation . 
administration of drug0 with drug0 contain drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 , with drug0 , with metal cation such as drug0 , or with drug0 contain drug0 or drug0 , or with formulation contain divalent and trivalent cation such as drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- chewable/buffered tablet or the pediatric powder for oral solution , may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug0 , result in systemic concentration considerably low than desired . 
these agent should not be take within 0 hour before or 0 hour after drug0 administration . 
drug0 drug0 drug0 , like other drug0 , may inhibit the metabolism of drug0 and drug0 . 
these stimulant be commonly find in coffee and tea , respectively . 
in some patient , this may lead to reduce clearance , prolongation of plasma half-life , and enhance effect of drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 : drug0 be a competitive inhibitor of the metabolism of drug0 . 
serum drug0 concentration increase when drug0 be initiate in a patient maintain on drug0 . 
when initiate a multi-day course of drug0 in a patient maintain on drug0 , the drug0 maintenance dose should be halve for the period of concurrent use of drug0 and monitoring of serum drug0 concentration should be initiate as a guide to far dosage adjustment . 
drug0 : in subject receive drug0 , no significant change in clotting time be observe when drug0 be coadministered . 
however , because some drug0 have be report to enhance the effect of drug0 or its derivative , prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitor closely if a drug0 be administer with drug0 or its derivative . 
drug metabolize by cytochrome p0 enzyme the drug interaction study evaluate the effect of drug0 on drug0 indicate that drug0 inhibit drug0 metabolism , which be mediate by cyp0a0 . 
while no clinical study have be conduct to evaluate the effect of drug0 on the metabolism of c.p.a. 
substrate , in vitro datum suggest similar effect of drug0 in cyp0a0 mediated metabolism and drug0 metabolism . 
in addition , other drug0 have be report to decrease the cyp0a0-mediated metabolism of drug0 . 
other drug metabolize by c.p.a. 
include drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
the clinical relevance of the potential effect of drug0 on the metabolism of c.p.a. substrate be not know . 
patient receive concurrent administration of substrate of c.p.a. be not exclude from clinical trial of drug0 . 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- : the concomitant administration of a drug0 with a drug0 may increase the risk of cns stimulation and convulsions . 
drug0 : disturbance of blood glucose , include hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia , have be report in patient treat concomitantly with drug0 and an drug0 . 
therefore , careful monitoring of blood glucose be recommend when these agent be coadministered . 
the absorption of drug0 may be affect by the simultaneous administration of indigestion remedy , drug0 or drug0 supplement . 
oral drug0 may be less effective while you be take drug0 .

drug0 : drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- have be safely coadministered with drug0 . 
drug0 : a study in normal healthy volunteer have show that concomitant administration of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and drug0 do not result in altered pharmacoktnetics of either drug . 
in a study in hypertensive patient , addition of drug0 to existing drug0 therapy do not result in any unexpected adverse effect , and drug0 have an additional antihypertensive effect . 
drug0 : in a single dose study in normal volunteer , coadministration of drug0 have a small effect on the rate but no effect on the extent of drug0 bioavailability . 
significant increase in auc -lrb- 0 % -rrb- and cmax -lrb- 0 % -rrb- and decrease in tmax -lrb- 0 % -rrb- of drug0 be note in this study . 
however , concomitant administration of 0 mg b.i.d. drug0 and 0 mg b.i.d. 
drug0 to healthy volunteer under steady-state condition have no relevant effect on either drug s bioavailability , auc and cmax , difference be 0 % between drug0 give singly and in combination with drug0 , and between drug0 give singly and in combination with drug0 . 
drug0 : in a study in healthy volunteer , a one-week course of drug0 at 0 mg b.i.d. with a single 0 mg dose of drug0 on the #ord# day show an increase in drug0 mean peak plasma concentration -lrb- 0 % -rrb- and significant increase in area under the curve -lrb- 0 % -rrb- . 
if drug0 therapy be initiate in a patient currently receive drug0 careful monitoring for adverse reaction be advised and downward dose adjustment may be require . 
drug0 : in a study in healthy volunteer , a six-day course of drug0 at 0 mg/day followed by a single 0 mg dose of drug0 result in a reduction in drug0 level to below detectable limit . 
if drug0 therapy be require , drug0 concentration and therapeutic effect be likely to be markedly reduce or abolish as a consequence of increase metabolism and high clearance of drug0 . 
drug0 : in a study in healthy volunteer , no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between drug0 and racemic drug0 be see when #crd# single oral dose of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg body weight -rrb- be administer during 0 day of multipledose treatment with 0 mg b.i.d. drug0 . 
neither racemic drug0 nor drug0 binding to plasma protein in vitro be alter by the addition of the other drug . 
drug0 : the concomitant administration of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and drug0 in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study do not affect renal , nonrenal and total body clearance of drug0 . 
drug0 anesthesia : severe hypotension have be report during drug0 anesthesia with concomitant use of a drug0 and a drug0 . 
even though such interaction have not be see in clinical study with drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , an increase volume of circulate fluid might be require if such an interaction be to occur . 
in normal volunteer receive drug0 , the administration of drug0 decrease the renal clearance and significantly increase the plasma level of drug0 . 
in some patient , combined use of drug0 and drug0 have be associate with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage . 
therefore , drug0 and drug0 should not be use concomitantly . 
in a study in normal volunteer , it be find that chronic concurrent administration of 0 g of drug0 per day decrease drug0 blood level approximately 0 % . 
the concomitant use of drug0 with other drug0 be not recommend due to the increase possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity , with little or no increase in efficacy . 
clinical study have show that drug0 do not influence the hypoprothrombinemia produce by drug0 . 
however , when any additional drug , include drug0 , be add to the treatment of patient on drug0 therapy , the patient should be observe for alteration of the prothrombin time . 
in post-marketing experience , bleeding have be report in patient on concomitant treatment with drug0 and drug0 . 
caution should be exercise when drug0 and drug0 be administer concomitantly . 
when drug0 be give to patient receive drug0 , the plasma level of drug0 be likely to be increase .

other concomitant therapy : although specific interaction study be not performed , in clinical study , drug0 be use concomitantly with drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- without evidence of clinically significant adverse interaction . 
additive adverse effect result from cholinergic blockade may occur when drug0 be administer concomitantly with other drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 or some drug0 . 
drug0 may interfere with the absorption of drug0 . 
administer drug0 before meals ; 
drug0 after meals . 
drug0 be metabolize to drug0 by the cytochrome p0 -lrb- cyp0 -rrb- enzyme group , specifically cytochromes p0 0a0 -lrb- cyp0a0 -rrb- and cyp0c0 . 
the cyp0a0 isoenzyme be present in both the liver and intestine . 
drug0 be also know to be an inhibitor of cyp0a0 . 
therefore , drug0 have the potential for interaction with drug or substance that may be substrate , inhibitor or inducer of cyp0a0 . 
while only a limited number of in vivo drug-drug interaction with drug0 have be report , chiefly with the oral formulation , the potential for other interaction should be anticipate . 
this be especially important for drug associate with serious toxicity , such as other drug0 . 
if such drug be need , their dose should be reassess and , where appropriate , plasma concentration measure . 
in view of the long and variable half-life of drug0 , potential for drug interaction exist not only with concomitant medication but also with drug administer after discontinuation of drug0 . 
since drug0 be a substrate for cyp0a0 and cyp0c0 , drugs/substances that inhibit these isoenzymes may decrease the metabolism and increase serum concentration of drug0 . 
report example include the following : drug0 : drug0 be know to inhibit cyp0a0 to vary degree . 
a case report of #crd# patient take drug0 0 mg and drug0 0 mg #crd# time a day result in increase in drug0 concentration from 0 mg/l to 0 mg/l .

drug0 : in vitro datum indicate that drug0 inhibit the metabolism of drug0 , which can result in an increase in plasma drug0 level and prolongation of the qt interval on the ecg . 
drug0 : in vitro and/or in vivo datum indicate that drug0 , drug0 , and oral drug0 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug0 , which can result in an increase in plasma drug0 level and prolongation of the qt interval on the ecg . 
human pharmacokinetic datum indicate that oral drug0 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug0 , result in a mean eight-fold increase in auc of drug0 . 
a study in 0 normal male and female volunteer suggest that coadministration of drug0 and drug0 can result in prolongation of the qt interval on the ecg . 
drug0 : drug0 coadministration lead to an increase peak plasma concentration and auc of drug0 , there be no effect on drug0 absorption when it be coadministered with drug0 . 
the gastrointestinal absorption of drug0 and drug0 be accelerate when they be coadministered with drug0 . 
drug0 : in vitro datum indicate that drug0 and drug0 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug0 which can result in an increase in plasma drug0 level and prolongation of the qt interval on the ecg . 
other : coadministration of grapefruit juice with drug0 increase the bioavailability of drug0 and concomitant use should be avoid . 
drug0 should not be use concomitantly with other drug know to prolong the qt interval : certain drug0 , include those of class ia -lrb- such as drug0 and drug0 -rrb- and class iii -lrb- such as drug0 -rrb- ; 
drug0 -lrb- such as drug0 -rrb- ; 
certain drug0 -lrb- such as drug0 -rrb- ; 
certain drug0 -lrb- such as drug0 -rrb- ; 
drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
the preceding list of drug be not comprehensive . 
the acceleration of gastric emptying by drug0 could affect the rate of absorption of other drug . 
patient receive narrow therapeutic ratio drug or other drug that require careful titration should be followed closely ; 
if plasma level be be monitor , they should be reassess . 
the risk of use drug0 in combination with other drug have not be systematically evaluate . 
given the primary cns effect of drug0 , caution be advise in use it concomitantly with other cns-active drug . 
drug0 should not be use with drug0 . 
close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage be require when drug0 be administer with drug0 or drug0 . 
several drug0 have be report to block the pharmacologic effect of drug0 , drug0 , or similar agent , and such an effect may be anticipate with drug0 because of its structural similarity to other drug0 . 
the plasma concentration of drug0 have be report to be increase by the concomitant administration of drug0 ; 
plasma level of several closely related drug0 have be report to be increase by the concomitant administration of drug0 or hepatic enzyme inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- and decrease by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducer -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , and such an effect may be anticipate with drug0 as well . 
administration of drug0 have be report to increase the plasma level of drug0 , if give concomitantly . 
drug metabolize by p0 0d0 : the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome p0 0d0 -lrb- debrisoquin hydroxylase -rrb- be reduce in a subset of the aucasian population -lrb- about 0 % 0 % of caucasians be so-called poor metabolizers -rrb- ; 
reliable estimate of the prevalence of reduce p0 0d0 isozyme activity among asian , african and other population be not yet available . 
poor metabolizers have high than expect lasma concentration of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- when give usual dose . 
depend on the fraction of drug metabolize by p0 0d0 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large -lrb- 0 fold increase in plasma auc of the drug0 -rrb- . 
in addition , certain drug inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers . 
an individual who be stable on a given dose of drug0 may become abruptly toxic when give #crd# of these inhibiting drug as concomitant therapy . 
the drug that inhibit cytochrome p0 0d0 include some that be not metabolize by the enzyme -lrb- drug0 ; 
drug0 -rrb- and many that be substrate for p0 0d0 -lrb- many other drug0 , drug0 , and the drug0 drug0 and drug0 -rrb- . 
while all the drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 , inhibit p0 0d0 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
drug0 have also be show to inhibit p0 0a0 , an isoform also involve in drug0 metabolism . 
the extent to which drug0 - drug0 interaction may pose clinical problem will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug0 involve . 
nevertheless , caution be indicate in the co-administration of drug0 with any of the drug0 and also in switching from #crd# class to the other . 
of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiate drug0 treatment in a patient be withdraw from drug0 , give the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite -lrb- at least 0 week may be necessary -rrb- . 
concomitant use of agent in the drug0 -lrb- which include drug0 -rrb- with drug that can inhibit cytochrome p0 0d0 may require low dose than usually prescribe for either the drug0 or the other drug . 
furthermore , whenever #crd# of these drug be withdraw from co-therapy , an increase dose of drug0 may be require . 
it be desirable to monitor drug0 plasma level whenever an agent of the drug0 include drug0 be going to be co-administered with another drug know to be an inhibitor of p0 0d0 -lrb- and/or p0 0a0 -rrb- . 
because drug0 be highly bind to serum protein , the administration of drug0 to patient take other drug that be highly bind to protein -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- may cause an increase in plasma concentration of these drug , potentially result in adverse effect . 
conversely , adverse effect may result from displacement of protein-bound drug0 by other highly bind drug . 
no trial specifically examine potential drug interaction with drug0 be conduct , although many concomitant drug be use in clinical trial . 
no drug interaction be detect except for an increase in symptomatic hypotension in patient receive oral drug0 . 
the co-administration of drug0 with iv drug0 such as drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , or iv drug0 have not be evaluate -lrb- these drug be not co-administered with drug0 in clinical trial -rrb- .

concurrent use of drug0 with drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -rrb- may result in increase drug0 effect . 
when use concurrently with such drug , the dose of drug0 should be the smallest effective dose and the frequency of dosing reduce as much as possible when administer concomitantly with drug that potentiate the action of drug0 . 
in healthy volunteer , the pharmacokinetics of a 0-mg dose of drug0 administer as drug0 be not affect by the coadministration of a single 0-mg subcutaneous dose of drug0 . 
however , in another study in healthy volunteer , the pharmacokinetics of drug0 be significantly alter -lrb- 0 % decrease in auc and 0 % decrease in cmax -rrb- when a 0-mg dose of drug0 be administer 0 minute after a 0-mg dose of drug0 nasal spray . 
-lrb- the #crd# drug be administer in opposite nostril . -rrb- 
when the drug0 be administer 0 minute after the drug0 nasal spray , the auc of drug0 increase 0 % and cmax decrease 0 % . 
in neither case be the pharmacokinetics of drug0 affect by coadministration with drug0 . 
these result suggest that the analgesic effect of drug0 may be diminish when it be administer shortly after drug0 nasal spray , but by 0 minute any such reduction in effect should be minimal . 
the safety of use drug0 and drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- nasal spray during the same episode of migraine have not be establish . 
however , it should be note that both product be capable of produce transient increase in blood pressure . 
the pharmacokinetics of a 0-mg dose of drug0 administer as drug0 be not affect by the coadministration of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg qid -rrb- . 
conversely , the administration of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg drug0 qid -rrb- do not alter the pharmacokinetics of a 0-mg dose of drug0 . 
it be not know if the effect of drug0 be alter by concomitant medication that affect hepatic metabolism of drug -lrb- drug0 , etc. -rrb- , but physician should be alert to the possibility that a small initial dose and long interval between dose may be need . 
the fraction of drug0 absorbed be unaffected by the concomitant administration of a drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , but the rate of absorption be decrease . 
therefore , a slow onset can be anticipate if drug0 be administer concomitantly with , or immediately follow , a drug0 .

in the same study it be show that drug0 and drug0 have no significant effect on the intracellular phosphorylation of drug0 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell . 
drug0 : in vitro study in peripheral blood mononuclear cell , u0 and molt-0 cell reveal that drug0 significantly inhibit drug0 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner . 
effect be already see with dose correspond to relevant plasma level in human , and the intracellular phosphorylation of drug0 to its #crd# metabolite -lrb- include the active zalcitabine triphosphate metabolite -rrb- be significantly inhibit . 
drug0 inhibit drug0 phosphorylation at high concentration ratio -lrb- 0 and 0 -rrb- ; 
however , it be consider to be unlikely that this decrease of phosphorylated drug0 concentration be of clinical significance , as drug0 be a more efficient substrate for deoxycytidine kinase than drug0 . 
these in vitro study suggest that concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 in human may result in sub-therapeutic concentration of active phosphorylated drug0 , which may lead to a decrease drug0 effect of drug0 . 
it be unknown how the effect see in these in vitro study translate into clinical consequence . 
concomitant use of drug0 and drug0 be not recommend . 
drug0 : the combination of drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 have be study -lrb- as triple combination -rrb- in adult .

drug0 -lrb- oral -rrb- : the hypoprothrombinemic effect of drug0 may be potentiate , apparently by increase catabloism of vitamin k-dependent clotting factor . 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 , drug0 -rrb- : requirement for drug0 or oral drug0 may be reduce in hypothyroid patient with diabetes mellitus and may subsequently increase with the initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy . 
drug0 : action of some of drug0 may be impair when hypothyroid patient become euthyroid . 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 , drug0 -rrb- : drug0 have be report to induce both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism . 
drug0 : therapeutic effect of drug0 may be reduce . 
serum drug0 level may be decrease in hyperthyroidism or when a hypothyroid patient become euthyroid . 
drug0 : marked hypertension and tachycardia have be report in association with concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 : risk of cardiac arrhythmia may increase . 
drug0 -lrb- 0i and 0i -rrb- , drug0 : uptake of radiolabeled ion may be decrease . 
drug0 / drug0 : excessive concurrent use of drug0 may accelerate epiphyseal closure . 
untreated hypothyroidism may interfere with the growth response to drug0 or drug0 . 
drug0 : drug0 clearance may decrease in hypothyroid patient and return toward normal when a euthyroid state be achieve . 
drug0 : concurrent use may increase the therapeutic and toxic effect of both drug , possibly due to increase catecholamine sensitivity . 
onset of action of drug0 may be accelerate . 
drug0 : possible increase risk of coronary insufficiency in patient with coronary artery disease . 
in #crd# survey , 0 % of patient take drug0 in combination with drug0 experience tremor , as compare to 0 % report to occur with drug0 alone . 
the contribution of each of the treatment to this adverse reaction be unknown but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be exclude . 
drug possess beta-blocking property can blunt the bronchodilator effect of drug0 in patient with bronchospasm ; 
therefore , dose great than the normal antiasthmatic dose of drug0 may be require . 
drug0 have be show to increase the bioavailability of drug0 . 
since this could be explain either by enhance absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of drug0 , special care should be use in establish the dose require for blood pressure control in such patient . 
synergism have be show between drug0 anesthesia and intravenously administer drug0 . 
during controlled hypotensive anesthesia use drug0 in association with drug0 , high concentration -lrb- 0 % or above -rrb- of drug0 should not be use because the degree of hypotension will be increase and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure . 
the anesthesiologist should be inform when a patient be receive drug0 . 
drug0 blunt the reflex tachycardia produce by drug0 without prevent its hypotensive effect . 
if drug0 be use with drug0 in patient with angina pectoris , additional antihypertensive effect may occur . 
care should be take if drug0 be use concomitantly with drug0 s of the drug0 type . 
risk of anaphylactic reaction while take drug0 , patient with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergen may be more reactive to repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
such patient may be unresponsive to the usual dose of drug0 use to treat allergic reaction . 
drug/laboratory test interaction the presence of labetalol metabolite in the urine may result in falsely elevated level of urinary catecholamine , metanephrine , normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid when measure by fluorimetric or photometric method . 
in screening patient suspect of have a pheochromocytoma and be treat with drug0 , a specific method , such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction -lrb- e.g. , j chromatogr 0 -rrb- should be employ in determine level of catecholamine . 
drug0 have also be report to produce a false positive test for drug0 when screen urine for the presence of drug use the commercially available assay method toxi-lab a -lrb- thin-layer chromatographic assay -rrb- and emit-d.a.u. -lrb- radioenzymatic assay -rrb- . 
when patient be treat with drug0 have a positive urine test for drug0 use these technique confirmation should be make by use more specific method such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique . 
the following drug interaction be observe in some patient undergo treatment with oral drug0 . 
although the pattern of use for oral drug0 include long term therapy , particularly for gout and renal calculi , the experience gain may be relevant . 
drug0 / drug0 : drug0 inhibit the enzymatic oxidation of drug0 and drug0 to drug0 . 
this oxidation , which be catalyze by xanthine oxidase , inactivate drug0 . 
in patient receive drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- or drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , the concomitant administration of 0 mg of drug0 per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of drug0 or drug0 . 
subsequent adjustment of dose of drug0 or drug0 should be make on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effect . 
drug0 : it have be report that drug0 prolong the half-life of the drug0 , drug0 . 
the clinical basis of this drug interaction have not be establish but should be note when drug0 be give to patient already on drug0 therapy . 
consequently , prothrombin time should be reassess periodically in patient receive both drug . 
drug0 : since the excretion of drug0 be similar to that of urate , drug0 , which increase the excretion of urate , be also likely to increase the excretion of drug0 and thus low the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase . 
the concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 have be associate with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines -lrb- hypoxanthine and xanthine -rrb- and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compare with that observe with drug0 alone . 
although clinical evidence to date have not demonstrate renal precipitation of oxypurines in patient either on drug0 alone or in combination with drug0 , the possibility should be keep in mind . 
drug0 : the report that the concomitant use of drug0 and drug0 may contribute to the enhancement of drug0 toxicity in some patient have be review in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation . 
review of these case report indicate that the patient be mainly receive drug0 for hypertension and that test to rule out decrease renal function secondary to hypertensive nephropathy be not often performed . 
in those patient in whom renal insufficiency be document , however , the recommendation to lower the dose of drug0 be not followed . 
although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not be establish , current evidence suggest that renal function should be monitor in patient on drug0 and drug0 even in the absence of renal failure , and dosage level should be even more conservatively adjust in those patient on such combined therapy if diminish renal function be detect . . 
drug0 / drug0 : an increase in the frequency of skin rash have be report among patient receive drug0 or drug0 concurrently with drug0 compare to patient who be not receive both drug . 
the cause of the report association have not be establish . 
drug0 : enhance bone marrow suppression by drug0 and other drug0 have be report among patient with neoplastic disease , except leukemia , in the presence of drug0 . 
however , in a well-controlled study of patient with lymphoma on combination therapy , drug0 do not increase the marrow toxicity of patient treat with drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and/or drug0 . 
drug0 : drug0 s plasma half-life may be prolonged by drug0 , since drug0 and drug0 may compete for excretion in the renal tubule . 
the risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increase if drug0 and drug0 be give concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency . 
drug0 : report indicate that drug0 level may be increase during concomitant treatment with drug0 for injection . 
monitoring of drug0 level and possible adjustment of drug0 dosage should be consider when these drug be co-administered . 
drug0 s conversion to inactive metabolite have be show to be catalyze by xanthine oxidase from rat liver . 
the clinical significance , if any , of these observation be unknown . 
drug0 generally should not be give with drug0 because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of drug0 toxicity . 
read circulars for drug0 preparation before use of such concomitant therapy . 
drug0 may increase the ototoxic potential of other drug such as drug0 and some drug0 . 
their concurrent use should be avoid . 
a number of drug , include drug0 , have be show to displace drug0 from plasma protein ; 
a reduction in the usual drug0 dosage may be require in patient receive both drug . 
in some patient , the administration of a drug0 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effect of drug0 , drug0 and drug0 . 
therefore , when drug0 and drug0 be use concomitantly , the patient should be observe closely to determine if the desired effect of the drug0 be obtain . 
drug0 : several short-term controlled study fail to wshow that drug0 significantly affect prothrombin time or a variety of other clotting factor when administer to individual on drug0 . 
however , because bleeding have be report when drug0 and other drug0 have be administer to patient on drug0 , the physician should be cautious when administer drug0 to patient on drug0 . 
drug0 : animal study wshow that drug0 give with drug0 , include drug0 , yield a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood level of the non-aspirin drug . 
single dose bioavailability study in normal volunteer have fail to wshow an effect of drug0 on drug0 blood level . 
correlative clinical study have not be performed . 
drug0 : drug0 , as well as other drug0 , probably reduce the tubular secretion of drug0 base on in vitro study in rabbit kidney slice . 
this may indicate that drug0 could enhance the toxicity of drug0 . 
caution should be use if drug0 be administer concomitantly with drug0 . 
h-0 antagonist : in study with human volunteer , co-administration of drug0 or drug0 with drug0 have no substantive effect on drug0 serum concentration . 
drug0 : clinical study , as well as random observation , have show that drug0 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug0 and drug0 in some patient . 
this response have be attribute to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
during concomitant therapy with drug0 , the patient should be observe closely for sign of renal failure , as well as to assure drug0 efficacy . 
drug0 : drug0 produce an elevation of plasma drug0 level and a reduction in renal drug0 clearance in a study of #crd# normal volunteer . 
the mean minimum drug0 concentration increase 0 % and the renal clearance of drug0 be decrease by 0 % during this period of concomitant drug administration . 
this effect have be attribute to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by drug0 . 
thus , when drug0 and drug0 be administer concurrently , subject should be observe carefully for sign of drug0 toxicity . 
-lrb- read circulars for drug0 preparation before use of such concurrent therapy -rrb- . 
renal clearance measurement of drug0 cannot be make with any significant accuracy in patient receive drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 . 
these compound interfere with chemical color development essential to the analytical procedure . 
drug0 depress tubular secretion of certain weak acid such as drug0 . 
therefore , patient receive drug0 will have erroneously low erpf and tm drug0 value . 
drug0 should not be administer concomitantly with potent drug0 such as drug0 and drug0 as the potential for ototoxicity be enhance by the combination . 
no formal drug interaction study have be conduct with drug0 . 
the concurrent administration of drug0 and drug0 increase substantially the incidence of rash in patient receive both drug as compare to patient receive drug0 alone . 
it be not know whether this potentiation of drug0 rash be due to drug0 or the hyperuricemia present in these patient . 
in controlled clinical trial of drug0 , 0 patient receive concomitant drug0 and drug0 . 
no rash be report in these patient . 
however , this sample size be too small to allow for any conclusion to be draw regard the risk of rash with concomitant drug0 and drug0 use . 
in common with other drug0 , drug0 may reduce the efficacy of oral drug0 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 - or drug0 -containing -rrb- : concomitant administration of 0-mg drug0 capsule with 0 ml drug0 suspension reduce the rate -lrb- cmax -rrb- and extent -lrb- auc -rrb- of absorption by approximately 0 % . 
time to reach cmax be also prolong by 0 hour . 
there be no significant effect on drug0 pharmacokinetics if the drug0 be administer 0 hour before or 0 hour after drug0 . 
if drug0 be require during drug0 therapy , drug0 should be take at least 0 hour before or after the drug0 . 
drug0 : as with other drug0 , drug0 inhibit the renal excretion of drug0 , result in an approximate doubling in a.c. a 0 % increase in peak drug0 plasma level , and a 0 % prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life . 
drug0 and foods fortify with drug0 concomitant administration of drug0 with a therapeutic drug0 contain 0 mg of elemental drug0 -lrb- as feso0 -rrb- or drug0 supplement with 0 mg of elemental drug0 reduce extent of absorption by 0 % and 0 % , respectively . 
if drug0 be require during drug0 therapy , drug0 should be take at least 0 hour before or after the supplement . 
the effect of food highly fortify with elemental drug0 -lrb- primarily drug0 -fortified breakfast cereal -rrb- on drug0 absorption have not be study . 
concomitantly administer drug0 -fortified infant formula -lrb- 0 mg elemental drug0 0 oz -rrb- have no significant effect on drug0 pharmacokinetics . 
therefore , drug0 for oral suspension can be administer with drug0 -fortified infant formula . 
there have be rare report of reddish stool in patient who have receive drug0 in japan . 
the reddish color be due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between drug0 or its breakdown product and drug0 in the gastrointestinal tract . 
drug/laboratory test interaction a false-positive reaction for ketone in the urine may occur with test use drug0 , but not with those use drug0 . 
the administration of drug0 may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in urine use clinitest , benedict s solution , or fehlings solution . 
it be recommend that glucose test base on enzymatic glucose oxidase reaction -lrb- such as clinistix or tes-tape -rrb- be use . 
drug0 be know to occasionally induce a positive direct coombs test . 
no information available . 
catecholamine-depleting drug , e.g. , drug0 , may have an additive effect when give with drug0 . 
patient treat concurrently with drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observe for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may result in vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
a study of interaction between drug0 and drug0 show that concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 do not alter drug0 plasma level . 
drug0 concentration be equivocally high when give with drug0 , but this be not likely to be clinically important . 
when drug0 and drug0 be concomitantly administer intravenously to normal volunteer , there be a 0 % increase in drug0 blood level at some time point . 
drug0 do not affect drug0 pharmacokinetics . 
when intravenous drug0 and drug0 be concomitantly administer in normal subject , no effect on drug0 blood level be see , but drug0 steady-state blood level be increase by 0 % in the presence of drug0 . 
no other pharmacokinetic parameter be change . 
the effect of drug0 on the duration of drug0 -induced neuromuscular blockade be study in patient undergo surgery . 
the onset of neuromuscular blockade by drug0 be unaffected by drug0 , but the duration of neuromuscular blockade be prolong from 0 minute to 0 minute .

while take drug0 , patient with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergen may be more reactive to repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
such patient may be unresponsive to the usual dose of drug0 use to treat allergic reaction . 
caution should be exercise when consider the use of drug0 and drug0 in patient with depressed myocardial function . 
fatal cardiac arrest have occur in patient receive both drug . 
additionally , drug0 should not be use to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agent which be vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 because of the danger of block cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance be high . 
in patient receive nonselective drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- in combination with drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , there have be report of serious , sometimes fatal , reaction . 
because drug0 be a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor , drug0 should not be use concomitantly with a drug0 . 
at least 0 day should elapse between discontinuation of a drug0 and initiation of treatment with drug0 . 
at least 0 week should elapse between discontinuation of drug0 and initiation of treatment with a drug0 . 
a rare , but serious , constellation of symptom , term serotonin syndrome , have be report with the concomitant use of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and agent for migraine therapy , such as drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and drug0 . 
the syndrome require immediate medical attention and may include #crd# or more of the follow symptom : excitement , hypomania , restlessness , loss of consciousness , confusion , disorientation , anxiety , agitation , motor weakness , myoclonus , tremor , hemiballismus , hyperreflexia , ataxia , dysarthria , incoordination , hyperthermia , shivering , pupillary dilation , diaphoresis , emesis , and tachycardia . 
drug0 should not be administer with other drug0 . 
the appropriate interval between administration of these agent and drug0 have not be establish . 
the use of drug0 with other cns-active drug have not be systematically evaluate ; 
consequently , caution be advise if drug0 and such drug be prescribe concurrently . 
drug0 be highly bind to plasma protein -lrb- 0 % -rrb- . 
therefore , caution should be use when administer drug0 concurrently with other highly plasma protein- bind drug with narrow therapeutic index , as competition for binding site may occur . 
the extent of plasma protein binding of drug0 in human plasma be not affect by the presence of therapeutic concentration of drug0 -lrb- 0 mcg/ ml -rrb- , nor be the binding of drug0 affect by the presence of drug0 . 
drug0 : coadministration of drug0 and drug0 suspension result in a significant decrease in average steady- state plasma drug0 concentration . 
alternative to drug0 should be consider during the course of pcp treatment with drug0 .

no interaction trial have be conduct with drug0 and drug0 . 
drug/ laboratory test interaction : it be not know if drug0 interfere with clinical laboratory test or assay result . 
medication that interfere with your bodys ability to use folate may also increase the need for this drug0 . 
medication can interfere with folate utilization , include : drug0 -lrb- such as drug0 , and drug0 -rrb- drug0 -lrb- sometimes prescribe to control blood sugar in type 0 diabetes -rrb- drug0 -lrb- use to control inflammation associate with crohns disease and ulcerative colitis -rrb- drug0 -lrb- a drug0 -rrb- drug0 there have be concern about the interaction between drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 supplement can correct the anemia associate with vitamin b0 deficiency . 
unfortunately , drug0 will not correct change in the nervous system that result from vitamin b0 deficiency . 
permanent nerve damage could theoretically occur if vitamin b0 deficiency be not treat . 
therefore , intake of supplemental drug0 should not exceed 0 microgram -lrb- g , sometimes mcg -rrb- per day to prevent drug0 from masking symptom of vitamin b0 deficiency . 
it be important for old adult to be aware of the relationship between drug0 and drug0 because they be at great risk of have a vitamin b0 deficiency . 
if you be 0 year of age or old , ask your physician to check your b0 status before you take a supplement that contain drug0 . 
ergot-containing drug have be report to cause prolonged vasospastic reaction . 
due to a theoretical risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction , use of drug0 -containing or drug0 -lrb- like drug0 or drug0 -rrb- and drug0 within 0 hour of each other should be avoid -lrb- see a href= #hlink# # ci contraindication -rrb- . 
concomitant use of other 0-ht0b/0d agonist within 0 hour of drug0 treatment be not recommend . 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- have be report , rarely , to cause weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination when coadministered with drug0 .

drug/laboratory test interaction drug0 be not know to interfere with commonly employ clinical laboratory test . 
elevated plasma level of drug0 have be report with concomitant drug0 use . 
there have be report of drug0 -related side effect in patient on concomitant therapy with drug0 and drug0 . 
therefore , monitoring of drug0 plasma level should be consider and dosage of drug0 adjust , as require . 
drug0 have be show to interfere with the metabolism of drug0 . 
this may lead to reduce clearance of drug0 and the prolongation of its plasma half-life . 
drug0 , include drug0 , may enhance the effect of the oral drug0 drug0 or its derivative . 
when these product be administer concomitantly , prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitor . 
drug0 interfere with the therapeutic action of drug0 . 
drug0 contain drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 ; 
drug0 or divalent or trivalent cation such as drug0 ; 
drug0 contain drug0 ; 
and drug0 , -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , chewable/buffered tablet or the pediatric powder for oral solution may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug0 , result in systemic level considerably low than desire . 
these agent should not be take within the #crd# hour period before or within the two-hour period after drug0 administration . 
elevated serum level of drug0 have be report with the concomitant use of some drug0 and drug0 . 
therefore , drug0 serum level should be monitor and appropriate drug0 dosage adjustment make when these drug be use concomitantly . 
drug0 when use in combination with other cytotoxic drug may show on-treatment additive toxicity , especially hematologic and gastrointestinal effect . 
concomitant use of drug0 with other cardioactive compound that could cause heart failure -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- , require close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment . 
there be few datum regard the coadministration of radiation therapy and drug0 . 
in adjuvant trial of drug0 -containing cef-0 or fec-0 chemotherapy , breast irradiation be delay until after chemotherapy be complete . 
this practice result in no apparent increase in local breast cancer recurrence relative to publish account in the literature . 
a small number of patient receive drug0 -based chemotherapy concomitantly with radiation therapy but have chemotherapy interrupt in order to avoid potential overlap toxicity . 
it be likely that use of drug0 with radiotherapy may sensitize tissue to the cytotoxic action of irradiation . 
administration of drug0 after previous radiation therapy may induce an inflammatory recall reaction at the site of the irradiation . 
drug0 be extensively metabolize by the liver . 
change in hepatic function induce by concomitant therapy may affect drug0 metabolism , pharmacokinetics , therapeutic efficacy , and/or toxicity . 
drug0 increase the auc of drug0 by 0 % .

these compound be metabolize through various cytochrome p0 isozymes include cyp0a0 , cyp0c0 , cyp0c0 , cyp0d0 , and cyp0a . 
when drug0 be administer concomitantly with drug0 -lrb- cyp0a0 , cyp0a -rrb- , a minor increase -lrb- 0 % -rrb- in the clearance of drug0 be see . 
because the small magnitude and the direction of the effect on drug0 clearance , this interaction be unlikely to be clinical concern . 
nonetheless , individual patient may require additional titration of their drug0 dosage when drug0 be start or stop to ensure clinically effective blood level . 
drug0 have also be show to have no clinically significant interaction with drug0 . 
in a single-dose crossover study examine drug0 0 mg and drug0 0 mg each administer alone and concomitantly with drug0 0 gram , absorption of the drug0 be delay and their bioavailability be reduce by 0 % and 0 % , respectively , when administer concomitantly with drug0 . 
therefore , drug0 should be take at least 0 minute prior to drug0 . 
in clinical trial , drug0 be administer concomitantly with drug0 delayed-release capsule ; 
this do not interfere with its effect . 
drug0 cause a profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion ; 
therefore , it be theoretically possible that drug0 may interfere with the absorption of drug where gastric ph be an important determinant of bioavailability -lrb- e.g. drug0 , drug0 ester , drug0 salt , drug0 -rrb- .

no drug interaction study have be conduct for drug0 , however the use of orally administer drug0 could , theoretically , interfere with the release of drug0 in the colon . 
the pharmacokinetic interaction list below be potentially clinically important . 
drug that induce hepatic enzyme such as drug0 , drug0 and drug0 may increase the clearance of drug0 and may require increase in drug0 dose to achieve the desired response . 
drug such as drug0 and drug0 may inhibit the metabolism of drug0 and thus decrease their clearance . 
therefore , the dose of drug0 should be titrate to avoid steroid toxicity . 
drug0 may increase the clearance of chronic high dose drug0 . 
this could lead to decrease drug0 serum level or increase the risk of drug0 toxicity when drug0 be withdraw . 
drug0 should be use cautiously in conjunction with drug0 in patient suffer from hypopro-thrombinemia . 
the effect of drug0 on oral drug0 be variable . 
there be report of enhance as well as diminish effect of drug0 when give concurrently with drug0 . 
therefore , coagulation index should be monitor to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect . 
drug interaction : a. drug enhancing drug0 effect : oral drug0 : drug0 may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time . 
therefore , when drug0 be give with drug0 or drug0 , a period of at least 0 hour after the last intravenous dose or 0 hour after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood be draw if a valid prothrombin time be to be obtain . 
drug0 : drug such as drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and other that interfere with platelet-aggregation reaction -lrb- the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patient -rrb- may induce bleeding and should be use with caution in patient receive drug0 . 
the anticoagulant effect of drug0 be enhance by concurrent treatment with drug0 -lrb- human -rrb- in patient with hereditary antithrombin iii deficiency . 
thus in order to avoid bleeding , reduce dosage of drug0 be recommend during treatment with drug0 -lrb- human -rrb- . 
b . 
drug decrease drug0 effect : drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of drug0 .

since aminotransferase determination be important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction , liver disease and pulmonary embolus , rise that might be cause by drug -lrb- drug0 -rrb- should be interpret with caution . 
the following drug have be coadministered with drug0 and have not alter its pharmacokinetics : drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
concomitant administration of drug0 with the oral drug0 drug0 have be show not to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of drug0 . 
catecholamine-depleting drug -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- may have an additive effect when give with drug0 agent . 
patient treat with a drug0 plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observe for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
should it be decide to discontinue therapy in patient receive drug0 and drug0 concurrently , the drug0 should be discontinue slowly over several day before the gradual withdrawal of drug0 . 
literature report suggest that oral drug0 may be use in combination with drug0 when heart function be normal , but should be avoid in patient with impaired cardiac function . 
hypotension , av conduction disturbance , and left ventricular failure have be report in some patient receive drug0 when an oral drug0 be add to the treatment regimen . 
hypotension be more likely to occur if the drug0 be a drug0 , e.g. , drug0 , while left ventricular failure and av conduction disturbance , include complete heart block , be more likely to occur with either drug0 or drug0 . 
risk of anaphylactic reaction : although it be know that patient on drug0 may be refractory to drug0 in the treatment of anaphylactic shock , drug0 can , in addition , interfere with the modulation of allergic reaction and lead to an increase severity and/or frequency of attack . 
severe allergic reaction include anaphylaxis have be report in patient expose to a variety of allergen either by repeated challenge , or accidental contact , and with diagnostic or therapeutic agent while receive drug0 . 
such patient may be unresponsive to the usual dose of drug0 use to treat allergic reaction .

because drug0 be not significantly metabolize by the cytochrome p0 system and at therapeutic concentration have no effect on p0 enzyme , interaction with drug that inhibit or be metabolize by those enzyme would not be expect . 
drug0 reversible increase in serum drug0 concentration and toxicity have be report during concomitant administration of drug0 with drug0 , and with some drug0 . 
an increase in serum drug0 concentration have be report during concomitant administration of drug0 with drug0 , so careful monitoring of serum drug0 level be recommend during concomitant use . 
potential for other drug to affect drug0 : both cyp0a0 and cyp0d0 be responsible for drug0 metabolism . 
inhibitor of cyp0a0 : concomitant use of drug0 with drug0 , an inhibitor of cyp0a0 , result in approximately a 0-fold increase in auc and about a 0-fold increase in cmax of drug0 . 
some drug0 would be expect to have similar effect and these combination should be avoid . 
inhibitor of cyp0d0 : because cyp0d0 be involve in drug0 metabolism , concomitant use of drug0 with potent inhibitor of cyp0d0 may result in high concentration of drug0 . 
drug0 -lrb- 0 mg qd -rrb- increase the concentration of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg qd -rrb- by about 0 % , and great degree of inhibition be expect with high dose of drug0 . 
similar effect would be expect with other potent cyp0d0 inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- . 
potential for drug0 to affect other drug : drug metabolize by cyp0a0 : in vitro drug interaction study demonstrate that drug0 do not induce cyp0a0 activity , and it be unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of cyp0a0 substrate . 
drug metabolize by cyp0d0 : drug0 be a moderate inhibitor of cyp0d0 . 
when drug0 be administer -lrb- at a dose of 0 mg bid -rrb- in conjunction with a single 0-mg dose of drug0 , a cyp0d0 substrate , the auc of drug0 increase 0-fold . 
therefore , co-administration of drug0 with other drug that be extensively metabolize by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index , include certain drug0 -lrb- drug0 -lsb- drug0 -rsb- , such as drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -rrb- , drug0 and drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , should be approach with caution . 
plasma drug0 concentration may need to be monitor and the dose of the drug0 may need to be reduce if a drug0 be co-administered with drug0 . 
because of the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death potentially associate with elevated plasma level of drug0 , drug0 and drug0 should not be co-administered . 
drug metabolize by cyp0a : result of in vitro study demonstrate that drug0 do not inhibit or induce cyp0a activity . 
drug0 may have a clinically important interaction with the following other drug : drug0 : when drug0 and drug0 be administer several hour apart so that peak concentration of each would coincide , drug0 do not increase the impairment of mental and motor skill cause by drug0 . 
in the drug0 clinical trial database , #crd# drug0 -treated patient have liver injury as manifest by alt and total bilirubin elevation , with evidence of obstruction . 
substantial intercurrent drug0 use be present in each of these case , and this may have contribute to the abnormality see . 
cns acting drug : given the primary cns effect of drug0 , it should be use with caution when it be take in combination with or substitute for other centrally act drug , include those with a similar mechanism of action . 
potential for interaction with drug that affect gastric acidity : drug0 have an enteric coating that resist dissolution until reach a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the ph exceed 0 . 
in extremely acidic condition , drug0 , unprotected by the enteric coating , may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol . 
caution be advise in use drug0 in patient with condition that may slow gastric emptying -lrb- e.g. , some diabetic -rrb- . 
drug that raise the gastrointestinal ph may lead to an early release of drug0 . 
however , co-administration of drug0 with drug0 - and drug0 -containing drug0 -lrb- 0 meq -rrb- or drug0 with drug0 , have no significant effect on the rate or extent of drug0 absorption after administration of a 0-mg oral dose . 
it be unknown whether the concomitant administration of drug0 affect drug0 absorption . 
in study in normal volunteer , there be no pharmacodynamic interaction between intravenous drug0 and either drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 . 
however , drug0 have the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of drug0 and drug0 . 
since drug0 inhibit platelet function , there be a potential for increase risk of bleeding , particularly in patient maintain on drug0 . 
during clinical trial , drug0 be use concurrently with drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and other medication . 
intravenous infusion of drug0 have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug0 . 
drug0 do not alter the clearance -lrb- pharmacokinetics -rrb- of drug0 . 
although clinical study have not be conduct , in vitro study of drug0 indicate that no relevant inhibition of cytochrome p0 drug metabolism would be expect . 
oral drug0 multiple dose of drug0 have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug0 , the estrogenic component in most oral drug0 . 
although the clinical significance be not know , it be not recommend that drug0 be take concomitantly with drug0 .

when combine with drug0 , drug0 exhibit strong synergistic activity while only additive effect be observe with the combination of drug0 -lrb- or drug0 -rrb- and drug0 . 
these result suggest that drug0 have a great potential in the treatment of m . 
ulcerans infection . 
pharmacokinetics of drug0 . 
effective use of drug in therapy depend not only on clinical acumen but also on the availability of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic datum . 
such information assist in development of safe dosing regimen , prediction of abnormal handling of drug in state of disease and disorder and anticipation of drug interaction . 
for the drug0 now available in the united state -lrb- drug0 , drug0 and drug0 -rrb- , these datum appear well after clinical pattern of use evolve . 
nonetheless , their relevance continue to be demonstrate by the dependence of each agent on intact liver blood flow and function for normal rate of elimination ; 
by the nonlinear kinetic characteristic for drug0 and drug0 -lrb- and probably for drug0 , as well -rrb- and the derivative implication for decrease dosing frequency requirement ; 
and by observation now appear on the relation between plasma drug level and drug effect , both therapeutic and toxic . 
such datum be discuss herein , with emphasis on those aspect that impact on the clinical use of the drug0 . 
herbal remedy , nephropathy , and renal disease . 
the use of herbal remedy be become increasingly popular in the united state . 
research have show that herbal remedy use may be associate with acute renal failure . 
in addition , the use of herbal remedy may be detrimental for the patient with compromise renal function . 
patient with renal insufficiency or renal failure may be at risk for far kidney damage as well as complication related to interaction of herbal remedy with complex renal therapy regimen . 
this article will describe the escalating use of herbal therapy and the hazard of herbal remedy use among patient . 
drug0 and their complication . 
drug that suppress the immune system be widely use . 
they be part of the treatment of patient with organ transplant , malignancy , and increasingly those with condition such as psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , and liver and bowel disease in which inflammation be an aetiological factor . 
because of the broadening indication for drug0 , and the prolonged survival in condition for which they be be use , many patient on immunosuppression be now care for in the community or see in non-specialist hospital , usually in close collaboration with a specialist . 
this article look at #crd# commonly use drug0 in turn -lrb- drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , discuss the main , non-infection , unwanted effect , way to avoid them and what to do if problem arise . 
the management of infection be deal with as a separate section . 
drug0 and drug0 similarly inhibit and stimulate drug0 - or drug0 -induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium . 
prostatic epithelium proliferate in a define medium consist of basal medium rpmi0 contain drug0 -lrb- 0 microgram/ml -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 ng/ml -rrb- , and drug0 -lrb- 0 micrograms/ml or 0 iu/ml -rrb- . 
although neither drug0 nor drug0 affect the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in rpmi0 containing drug0 alone , they modify the mitogenic effect of drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 at 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m or drug0 at about 0 x 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m inhibit proliferation stimulate by drug0 . 
high concentration of drug0 -lrb- 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- - 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m -rrb- or drug0 -lrb- 0 x 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- - 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m -rrb- enhance the mitogenic activity of drug0 . 
drug0 have a similar effect in the presence of drug0 . 
however , drug0 stimulate , but do not significantly inhibit , proliferation in the presence of drug0 . 
these result suggest that both drug0 and drug0 , and possibly other drug0 and drug0 , may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of drug0 and drug0 . 
death in drug0 user : cause and rate . 
the world medical literature contain 0 report of death associate with drug0 in a 0-year period . 
these include #crd# cerebrovascular accident , #crd# sudden cardiac death , #crd# case of hyperpyrexia , #crd# poisoning of uncertain mechanism and #crd# case of medical complication of intravenous injection ; 
the remainder be of uncertain cause . 
in contrast , in ontario alone , in 0 and 0 there be 0 death in drug0 user , of which 0 be due to accident suicide or homicide . 
of the remain case , #crd# be cardiac , #crd# hepatic and the rest be mix drug overdose . 
pulmonary granuloma , subacute hepatitis and other lesion result from intravenous drug use be common finding at autopsy . 
on the basis of the estimate number of regular user of intravenous drug0 in ontario , the mortality rate in such user be at least #crd# time as high as in the general population of the same age , and be comparable to that in alcoholic and drug0 addict . 
however , the absolute number of drug0 -related death be far great than the number of death in drug0 or drug0 user . 
-lsb-a pharmacological analysis of the effect of drug0 on stimulate gastric secretion -rsb- chronic experiment on dog with gastric fistula be carry out to study the influence of drug0 and drug0 on drug0 - and drug0 -induced gastric acid secretion . 
it be establish that both angiotensin inhibit gastric acid secretion stimulate by drug0 but not by drug0 . 
comparative analysis of the effect of stimulation and inhibition of cholino- and adrenoreceptors on this inhibitory action of drug0 suggest the mediation of drug0 influence through the modulation of cholinergic reaction of parietal cell in the stomach . 
-lsb-stimulation by drug0 --an analog of the octapeptide cholecystokinin--of drug0 binding after the long-term administration of drug0 -rsb- it have be establish in experiment on white male rat that prolonged administration -lrb- twice a day for 0 day -rrb- of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- result in the reduce interaction between drug0 and low affinity binding site for drug0 in subcortical structure , whereas drug0 binding with high affinity binding site for drug0 increase both in the frontal cortex and subcortical structure of the forebrain . 
after prolonged administration of drug0 the displacing effect of drug0 , an analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide , be replace by the stimulant action on drug0 binding . 
it be assume that increase interaction between drug0 and high affinity binding site for drug0 on dopamine0- and serotonin0-receptors underlie the antipsychotic action of drug0 after their prolonged administration . 
cholecystokinin octapeptide be a necessary factor for realization of this action of drug0 . 
interaction of drug0 and drug0 in rat . 
the interaction of intramuscularly inject drug0 and its n-demethylated metabolite -lrb- metabolite i -rrb- with drug0 be evaluate in rat . 
#crd# , 0 , 0 , or 0 mg/kg of drug0 alone or 0 , 0 , or 0 mg/kg of metabolite i alone produce less than 0 minute of hypnosis . 
however , drug0 anesthetic requirement -lrb- i.e. , mac -rrb- be depress in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 0 % 0 hour and as much as 0 % 0 hour after injection of drug0 , 0 mg/kg , im . 
the reduction in mac be correlate with brain level of drug0 or metabolite i , suggest a drug0 : metabolite i potency ration of 0 . 
the half-life of drug0 in plasma and brain be long in the presence of drug0 than when drug0 be give alone . 
it be conclude that drug0 be not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with drug0 would be expect to prolong far the duration of its action on the central nervous system . 
in vitro interaction of drug0 and drug0 in placental vessel . 
the interaction of drug0 and synthetic drug0 on placental vessel be study in vitro . 
resistance be measure near the placental margin after spontaneous term delivery . 
in #crd# experiment reaction to drug0 and drug0 be drug0 . 
drug0 produce significantly increase vasoconstriction after a single administration of drug0 . 
in #crd# experiment the perfusion medium contain drug0 . 
there be no change after a single dose of drug0 . 
the reaction after drug0 remain the same in both group of experiment . 
there be thus an enhancement effect 
there be thus an enhancement effect of drug0 upon the reaction of placental vessel to drug0 in vitro . 
note : dissolution of aerosol particle of drug0 in drug0 , a model drug0 . 
the effect of a drug0 extract from bovine lung , drug0 , on the dissolution rate of aerosol particle of drug0 be determine . 
aerosol particle of drug0 be generate from an drug0 solution , dry , and collect by a cascade impactor for characterization or by a liquid impinger for dissolution experiment . 
powder x-ray diffraction , differential scanning calorimetry , differential thermal analysis , and scanning electron microscopy be use to characterize the aerosol particle and start material . 
no change in phase be detect , although the aerosol particle appear to contain residual drug0 . 
the dissolution rate of the aerosol particle in saline be low and variable . 
drug0 increase the extent of dissolution of drug0 in proportion to the add concentration , which be also verify by equilibrium solubilization study . 
drug0 also increase rate of dissolution , in a manner similar to drug0 . 
analysis of the concentration of drug0 follow ultracentrifugation indicate that there be rapid equilibration of drug0 between the drug0 and aqueous phase . 
these result show that drug0 have the potential of enhance the rate and extent of dissolution of drug administer to the lung . 
anaesthesia and the epileptic pateint . 
a review . 
a review be present of some of the problem that may arise in association with anaesthesia for epileptic patient . 
there be the possibility of precipitate anticonvulsant drug toxicity . 
numerous drug interaction be possible with some drug0 , such as drug0 and drug0 , which affect hepatic microsomal enzyme system . 
there be the risk of convulsion occur in susceptible patient follow the use of the new drug0 which be capable of induce cns excitability . 
interaction between drug0 and drug0 in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryo . 
in this study we investigate whether also drug0 fulfils the function as co-activator in glutamatergic activation of nmda receptor in the neuronal apparatus of spontaneous motility in chick embryo . 
the successive application of drug0 -lrb- 0 or 0 mg/kg egg weight -lrb- e.w. -rrb- 
and drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg e.w. -rrb- 
the successive application of drug0 -lrb- 0 or 0 mg/kg egg weight -lrb- e.w. -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg e.w. -rrb- in a 0 min interval significantly increase the activation of spontaneous motility of 0-day-old chick embryo in comparison with the effect of drug0 alone . 
this effect do not depend on the order of application of the drug . 
in 0-day-old embryo , drug0 be ineffective in both dose . 
it be conclude from these result that the modulatory effect of drug0 be evidently a late developmental acquisition -lrb- after day 0 of incubation -rrb- in the embryogenesis of nmda-ergic activation of spontaneous motility in chick embryo similarly as glycinergic inhibition . 
acute effect of different drug0 on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
diabetic patient have a 0 % high risk of depression than the general population . 
treatment with drug0 can directly interfere with blood glucose level or may interact with drug0 . 
the treatment of depression in diabetic patient must take into account variation of glycemic level at different time and a comparison of the available drug0 be important . 
in the present study we evaluate the interference of drug0 with blood glucose level of diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
in a #ord# experiment , male adult wistar rat be fast for 0 h . 
drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- or vehicle be administer . 
after 0 min , fasting glycemia be measure . 
an oral drug0 overload of 0 ml of a 0 % drug0 solution be give to rat and blood glucose be determine after 0 , 0 and 0 min . 
drug0 and drug0 do not change fasting or overload glycemia . 
drug0 and drug0 increase blood drug0 at different time after the glucose overload . 
drug0 neutralize the increase of glycemia induce by oral drug0 overload . 
in the #ord# experiment , non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat be fast , and the same procedure be followed for estimation of drug0 tolerance 0 min after drug0 overload . 
again , drug0 neutralize the increase in glycemia after drug0 overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
these datum raise the question of whether drug0 be the good choice for prolonged use for diabetic individual , because of its antihyperglycemic effect . 
drug0 would be useful in case with potential risk of hypoglycemia . 
drug0 promote the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the microsomal fraction of rat liver and it enhance the effect of oleate in this respect . 
drug0 -lrb- 0 mm -rrb- promote the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction in a cell-free system derive from rat liver . 
by contrast , drug0 -lrb- 0 mm -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- 0 mm -rrb- have no significant effect on the translocation when add alone . 
drug0 , and to a less extent , drug0 , enhance the translocating action of oleate and increase its effectiveness in transfer the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction . 
it be propose that the phosphohydrolase become metabolically active when it combine with membrane and that polyamines might help to regulate this interaction . 
this could facilitate the action of fatty acid and enable cell to increase their capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis to match an increase availability of fatty acid . 
the effect of drug0 and of drug0 anesthesia on drug0 tolerance in dog . 
in a comparison of drug0 tolerance in dog anesthetize with drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 , the dosage of drug0 need to cause ventricular tachycardia be significantly high , as be the ld0 of drug0 , with drug0 or drug0 than with drug0 . 
ventricular tachycardia induce by drug0 be generally convert to sinus rhythm follow administration of drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 but not after administration of drug0 alone or after drug0 . 
excretion of thioethers in urine after exposure to electrophilic chemical . 
electrophilic agents--a class of chemical that include most genotoxic compounds--can be inactivate by reaction with glutathione or other sh-bearing molecule . 
the conjugate so form often appear in the urine as mercapturic acid or other thioether product . 
this paper critically review the suitability of the urinary thioether assay as a method for the detection of exposure to electrophilic agent or their precursor . 
in practice , the great value of the thioether assay appear to lie in its signal function . 
this be demonstrate for cigarette smoker and industrial worker involve in chemical waste incineration . 
whenever increase thioether excretion be observe , it be likely to be due to exposure to #crd# or more suspect compound . 
however , when the thioether concentration range within the limit of the normal value , #crd# must not conclude that there be no , or negligible , exposure . 
more specific application of the assay of thio compound in urine allow development of selective method that may be useful for biological monitoring . 
rhabdomyolysis secondary to a drug interaction between drug0 and drug0 . 
objective : to report a case of rhabdomyolysis result from concomitant use of drug0 and drug0 . 
case summary : a 0-year-old african-american man be admit to the hospital for worsening renal failure , elevated creatine phosphokinase , diffuse muscle pain , and severe muscle weakness . 
about #crd# week prior to admission , the patient be start on drug0 for sinusitis . 
the patient have be receive drug0 for approximately #crd# month . 
he be treat aggressively with intravenous hydration , drug0 , and hemodialysis . 
a muscle biopsy reveal necrotizing myopathy secondary to a toxin . 
the patient continue to receive intermittent hemodialysis until his death from infectious complication that occur #crd# month after admission . 
there be several factor that could have increase his risk for develop rhabdomyolysis , include chronic renal failure . 
discussion : drug0 be a potent inhibitor of cyp0a0 , the major enzyme responsible for drug0 metabolism . 
the concomitant administration of drug0 and other drug0 have result in previous report of rhabdomyolysis . 
other factor may increase the risk of this drug interaction , include the administration of other medication that be associate with myopathy , underlie renal insufficiency , and administration of high dose of drug0 . 
conclusion : drug0 inhibit the metabolism of drug0 that be metabolize by cyp0a0 -lrb- i.e. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- . 
this interaction may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis , particularly in patient with renal insufficiency or those who be concurrently take medication associate with myopathy . 
optimal design for the individual and joint exposure general logistic regression model . 
interest in administer compound in combination lie both in enhance efficacious effect and in limit adverse effect . 
although much statistical work have focus on develop mathematical function to model the joint dose-response curve , relatively little work exist in regard to designing experiment for assess joint action . 
a variety of parametric dose-response model base on either the normal or logistic probability distribution have be propose in the literature . 
these model be typically nonlinear in the parameter , and as such , a nonlinear weighted least squares approach can be employ for the purpose of designing experiment . 
the approach be applicable across a wide variety of setting commonly associate with joint action datum , include continuous and discrete response , alternative error structure , and nonzero background response . 
far , design can be express in term of proportionate response associate with the individual compound rather than dose level , thereby provide for result that be applicable across compound . 
as a precursor to this effort , optimal and minimal experimental design for the case in which a single compound be administer have also be develop . 
although the proposed methodology for derive experimental design can be apply to any nonlinear regression model , primary focus be give to the additive and nonadditive independent joint action -lrb- ija -rrb- model for individual and combined exposure propose by barton , braunberg , and friedman -lrb- 0 -rrb- . 
-lsb-the gaba-ergic system and brain edema -rsb- it have be show in rat with experimental toxic and traumatic edema that drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- remove the antiedematous action of drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and drug0 and reduce the action of drug0 . 
when the dose of drug0 be minimize to 0 mg/kg such an effect be not observe . 
prolonged daily administration of drug0 in a dose of 0 mg/kg result in the development of brain edema . 
it be recommend that gaba-positive drug be include into a complex of treatment measure for edema . 
new oral therapy for type 0 diabetes mellitus : the drug0 or insulin sensitizer . 
type 0 diabetes mellitus be a grow problem not only in the united state but also across the world . 
there be now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complication of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy . 
ultimately however , up to 0 % of type 0 diabetics die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease . 
this increase incidence of atherosclerotic disease be intricately associate with insulin resistance , which be a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 0 diabetes . 
there be strong evidence that insulin resistance be involve in the development of not only hyperglycemia , but also dyslipidemia , hypertension , hypercoagulation , vasculopathy , and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . 
this cluster of metabolic abnormality have be term the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
the drug0 -lrb- drug0 and drug0 -rrb- , a new class of oral drug0 , be &quot ; insulin sensitizers&quot ; 
and exert direct effect on the mechanism of insulin resistance . 
these effect not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduce insulin requirement , but also have potentially favorable effect on other component of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
long-term study be need to determine whether the insulin-sensitizing effect of the drug0 can prevent or delay premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , morbidity , and death . 
effect of drug0 on the apparent volume of distribution and elimination of drug0 . 
accord to gibaldi et al . 
-lrb- 0 , 0 -rrb- , the high serum concentration of drug0 and drug0 reach after administration of drug0 be due not only to slow renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body . 
to determine whether drug0 have a direct effect on the distribution of drug0 , the elimination and distribution of drug0 be study in #crd# patient , #crd# lack kidney function and #crd# with a partially impaired renal function , in the presence or absence of drug0 . 
no significant difference be find between the mean value of the volume of distribution of drug0 with and without drug0 -lrb- 0 and 0 liter , respectively -rrb- . 
thus , the hypothesis of gibaldi et al . 
could not be confirm for drug0 in patient lack kidney function . 
in spite of the absence of kidney function , the value of the elimination rate constant be significantly decrease in the presence of drug0 -lrb- from 0 to 0/h -rrb- . 
this might be explain by a blockade by drug0 of the elimination of drug0 by the liver . 
stereoselective behavioral effect of drug0 in pigeon and squirrel monkey . 
the behavioral effect of the stereoisomers of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- be compare with those of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- in pigeon and squirrel monkey respond under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio -lrb- fi fr -rrb- schedule of food presentation . 
intermediate dose of drug0 or drug0 produce transient increase in fi respond in monkey and sustained increase in fi respond in pigeon ; 
high dose decrease fi and fr respond in both species . 
in contrast to its enantiomer , drug0 fail to increase fi respond significantly in either species ; 
at high dose , drug0 decrease fi and fr respond . 
in monkey , drug0 be about 0 time more potent than drug0 in decrease respond , whereas in pigeon drug0 be about equipotent with drug0 . 
in both species , drug0 , but not drug0 , antagonize the rate-decreasing effect of drug0 on fi and fr respond . 
in monkey , the effect of drug0 , but not drug0 or drug0 , be antagonize by drug0 ; 
the dose of drug0 require to antagonize the effect of drug0 be more than 0 time high than those require to antagonize the effect of drug0 . 
in pigeon , drug0 do not systematically alter the effect of drug0 , drug0 or drug0 . 
drug0 reduce or eliminate the increase in fi respond produce by intermediate dose of either drug0 or drug0 in pigeon , but do not antagonize the decrease in fi or fr respond produce by high dose of pcp or either stereoisomer of drug0 . 
the result demonstrate a high degree of stereoselectivity in the behavioral effect of drug0 . 
the levorotatory isomer have opioid-antagonist and non-opioid agonist effect in pigeon and mixed opioid agonist-antagonist effect in monkey . 
the dextrorotatory isomer , on the other hand , have effect similar to those of drug0 in both species . 
cancer in the elderly : basic science and clinical aspect . 
the incidence of cancer increase progressively with age . 
rearrangement of genome have be find to accompany cellular aging . 
these factor , in concert with age-dependent alteration in immune function and host defense , may help to explain the increase risk of malignant disease in aged person . 
the clinical presentation and natural history of neoplasia be also affect by aging . 
this conference review recent development in these area , examine the effect of drug use in the elderly and implication for management , and discuss current information on how age may influence the response of cancer to therapy . 
prescribing . 
key to maximizing benefit while avoid adverse drug effect . 
when prescribe for old patient , some physician be overly cautious , and this strategy can result in a less than optimal treatment outcome . 
the reluctance to treat aggressively be understandable because the geriatric population be susceptible to adverse drug reaction . 
the key to maximizing therapy lie in individualizing it as much as possible . 
there be a number of step physician can take to ensure that their patient be not be undertreated . 
these step include regular reevaluation of dosage and plasma drug concentration , recognition and understanding of drug side effect , and avoidance of certain agent . 
close monitoring allow physician to minimize risk , maximize benefit , and get the most out of what modern medication can do to help old patient . 
determinant of cellular sensitivity to drug0 . 
it be now clear that topoisomerase activity level be an important determinant of sensitivity to topo drug . 
the regulation of topoisomerases be no doubt complex and multifaceted and be probably accomplish through redundancy at many control level . 
the mechanism -lrb- s -rrb- of altered topo i expression in certain tumor type be unknown , but may be related to the central importance of topoisomerases in proliferate cell function -lrb- transcription , replication , etc. -rrb- , and the aberrant and chronic activation of these function as a result of specific tumorigenic alteration . 
small difference in sensitivity to chemotherapy can have a dramatic effect on cure rate , and therefore subtle cell type-specific difference may be important determinant of drug sensitivity . 
whether abnormal topoisomerase quantity and specific activity be associate with resistance or sensitivity to topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy in the clinic be now be study . 
determinant downstream of cleavable complex formation that affect the sensitivity of tumor versus normal cell to topo drug in particular and dna-damaging agent in general be little know . 
the goal of enhancing selective tumor cell killing relative to the normal cell that be dose limit may be achieve either by overcome tumor cell resistance or by protect normal cell . 
both of these strategy will become more feasible as specific molecular difference between tumor and normal cell be be rapidly identify and new combination therapy that take advantage of these difference be be design and test . 
interaction of drug0 and drug0 in absorption and retention . 
the effect of supplementary oral drug0 and drug0 , as well as the interaction between both at the absorption site , fecal and urinary excretion as well as the retention of these trace element be determine by use #crd# diet contain either 0 or 0 micrograms/kg of drug0 and 0 or 0 mg/kg of drug0 over a period of 0 day in a total of 0 rat . 
retention be calculate by the balance technique and by the comparative slaughter technique . 
after #crd# day , fecal as well as urinary excretion of both element have already respond to the dietary treatment , with constant value be reach after approximately #crd# day . 
drug0 excretion be enhance by supplementary drug0 ; 
fecal excretion , too , be increase by supplementary drug0 ; 
whereas urinary excretion be decrease in both case . 
additional drug0 significantly inhibit the absorption of drug0 in both dietary drug0 treatment . 
the low rate of absorption in the group receive 0 mg drug0 instead of 0 mg of drug0 per kg diet result in a decrease renal excretion of drug0 . 
consequently , the effect of drug0 on the retention of drug0 be low than on absorption . 
this suggest that interaction between the #crd# element only take place at the site of absorption . 
because of the low dietary drug0 concentration as compare to the drug0 content of the diet , no effect of drug0 on drug0 absorption and excretion occur . 
difference in drug0 balance be only observe between both dietary concentration , show a high absolute but a low relative absorption as well as retention in the group feed far drug0 . -lrb- abstract truncate at 0 word -rrb- 
-lsb-importance of pharmacogenetics -rsb- pharmacogenetics deal with the difference in effect of drug cause by genetic variation . 
difference can occur in therapeutic effect and in adverse event . 
genetic variation in metabolism may result in high concentration of drug and an increase risk of adverse effect in slow metabolizers , which be important when use for example drug0 or chemotherapy . 
genetic variation also occur in protein interact with drug , which may change the effect of e.g. 
asthma drug and drug0 . 
the selection of drug and their dosage may be improve , and the number of adverse effect reduce by pharmacogenetic investigation . 
however , it may be important also in case of medical examination for insurance and job appointment , since some patient may turn out to need expensive drug or to be susceptible to a certain disease . 
therefore , the use of genetic datum in these instance have to be regulate . 
drug0 overdose recognize by a drug0 assay . 
altered mental status in an adolescent present a diagnostic challenge , and the clinician depend on clinical evaluation and laboratory study to determine therapy and prognosis . 
we report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness cause by drug0 overdose with a positive drug0 level to alert clinician to the cross-reactivity of drug0 with a toxicology screen for drug0 . 
drug0 . 
treatment plan for patient take drug0 can become complicate . 
drug0 predispose a patient to bleeding problem . 
many drug use in dentistry cannot be take concomitantly with these medication . 
acute drug0 administration do not affect subjective response to drug0 in human . 
rationale : stress and drug0 facilitate and reinstate psychostimulant self-administration in rodent . 
however , the effect of stress and drug0 on the subjective and behavioral effect of drug0 have not be well study in human . 
objective : to examine the effect of acute drug0 pretreatment on the subjective and behavioral effect of drug0 . 
method : drug0 -lrb- 0 mg -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- 0 mg -rrb- be administer orally to 0 healthy male and female volunteer in a four-session , placebo-controlled , within-subject , crossover design . 
to prevent stomach irritation , subject receive drug0 before each experimental session . 
dependent measure include self-reported mood and subjective effect -lrb- addiction research center inventory , the profile of mood state , and a series of visual analogue scale -rrb- , vital sign , salivary cortisol , and psychomotor performance . 
result : drug0 elevate salivary cortisol level , produce modest dysphoria , and reduce subject ' report of wanting more drug . 
however , drug0 pretreatment do not affect any of the physiological , behavioral , or subjective effect of drug0 . 
conclusion : in contrast to the effect of drug0 in rodent study , these result indicate that an acute increase in cortisol do not enhance the psychostimulant effect of drug0 in human . 
effect of drug0 on drug0 -induced change in steroid hormone level and lethality in male rat . 
we examine the effect of exogenous drug0 on the change in serum steroid hormone level induce by a nonlethal dose of escherichia coli drug0 in male rat and the death due to nonlethal and lethal dose of drug0 . 
injection of drug0 0 min before a nonlethal dose of drug0 change the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rat to drug0 . 
the serum estrogen concentration of drug0 + drug0 -treated rat decrease by 0 % , while those of the drug0 -treated rat increase -lrb- 0- to 0-fold -rrb- . 
the serum androgen concentration of drug0 + drug0 -treated rat do not change significantly , while those of drug0 -treated rat drop to 0 % 
0 . 
exogenous drug0 also appear to influence the percentage of drug0 -induced death in a dose-dependent manner . 
it reduce the number of death induce by nonlethal -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- dose of drug0 but increase the number of death induce by a highly lethal dose -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- . 
these result , together with the known relationship between drug0 and the immune response , suggest that drug0 affect the course of septic shock in a complex fashion and may have either protective or deleterious effect . 
study on the mechanism of action of drug0 : effect of drug0 on respiration and cell permeability of candida albicans . 
the drug0 , drug0 , inhibit the growth of several species of candida . 
candida albicans , #crd# of the pathogenic species , be totally inhibit at a concentration of approximately 0 mug/ml . 
endogenous respiration be unaffected by the drug at a concentration as high as 0 mug/ml , whereas exogenous respiration be markedly sensitive and inhibit to an extent of 0 % . 
the permeability of the cell membrane be change as evidence by the leakage of 0-nm absorbing material , amino acid , protein , and inorganic cation . 
the result we present clearly show that the drug alter the cellular permeability , and thus the exogenous respiration become sensitive to the drug . 
interferon induction : tool for establish interaction among homopolyribonucleotides . 
hitherto unrecognized interaction between homopolyribonucleotides and complex thereof be suggest by interferon induction datum obtain in a highly sensitive assay system of primary rabbit kidney cell culture superinduced by metabolic inhibitor . 
drug0 : a therapeutic update . 
background : since its approval by the us food and drug administration in march 0 , drug0 have be use by #crd# of man for the treatment of erectile dysfunction . 
recent study and consensus report have expand our understanding of its efficacy , safety , contraindication , and drug interaction . 
objective : this paper review recent study of the efficacy of drug0 , its adverse effect and drug interaction , and socioeconomic factor involve in its use , with a focus on specific patient population -lrb- prostate cancer , diabetes mellitus , ischemic heart disease , spinal cord injuries , neurologic disorder -rrb- . 
method : clinical study , case report , and commentary and editorial concern drug0 publish in the international literature between january 0 and august 0 be identify through search of medline , premedline , and international pharmaceutical abstracts , use the term drug0 , drug0 , and erectile dysfunction . 
result : drug0 have demonstrate effectiveness in man with erectile dysfunction associate with prostatectomy , radiation therapy , diabetes mellitus , certain neurologic disorder , and drug therapy -lrb- eg , drug0 -lsb- drug0 -rsb- -rrb- . 
it have not be as effective in woman with sexual dysfunction , with the exception of drug0 -associated sexual dysfunction . 
some disorder unrelated to sexual dysfunction -lrb- eg , esophageal motility dysfunction -rrb- may also respond to drug0 . 
in the general population , drug0 be consider to have an acceptable tolerability profile ; 
however , patient with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those take drug0 therapy be at increase risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effect with drug0 therapy . 
in addition , patient take drug that inhibit the cytochrome p0 0a0 isozyme , which metabolize drug0 , may experience increase drug concentration and possible toxicity from normal dose of drug0 . 
conclusion : drug0 be an effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in man . 
the decision to prescribe this agent should include such consideration as the cost-risk-benefit balance , patient access , drug distribution pathway , and prescription drug coverage . 
tumor phenotype and susceptibility to progression as an expression of subpopulation of initiated murine cell . 
currently , it be conceive that a number of event , or hit , be require for the induction of tumor by chemical agent . 
the #ord# phase of this sequence , initiation , be consider to result from at least #crd# event in the genetic apparatus . 
analysis of this sequence , however , usually give little consideration to the nature of the target cell or to the characteristic of the resultant tumor . 
vesselinovitch et al . 
-lrb- cancer res. , 0 : 0 , 0 -rrb- have report that a single , small pulse of carcinogen can induce early and numerous liver tumor when administer neonatally to mouse with a genetic predisposition to hepatotumorigenesis . 
in the current study , the nonpredisposed strain c0bl/0n be also show to be highly susceptible to diethylnitrosamine during the neonatal period . 
c0bl/0n demonstrate large number of #crd# of the #crd# type of liver tumor see in liver of genetically predispose mouse , #crd# of which require the additional stimulus of dietary drug0 for growth . 
tumor of more malignant phenotype be demonstrate only in genetically predispose mouse -lrb- c0bl/0n x c0h/hen f0 -rrb- that receive #crd# dose of carcinogen . 
these finding suggest that the phenotype of a tumor that result from a pulse of a chemical carcinogen may depend upon the target cell . 
the initiated cell that result from this hit may vary from those that demonstrate very little progression in cell type and may or may not require exogenous enhancement of growth to those that can progress very rapidly to fully malignant behavior . 
the latter might arise from a hit in a genetically initiate cell , the result of which be a more rapid progression in tumor type . 
effect of drug0 upon the metabolism of chylomicron-like emulsion in patient with coronary artery disease . 
slow chylomicron intravascular catabolism have be associate with coronary artery disease and screening for drug that can speed-up this process can be important . 
in this study , the effect of drug0 upon chylomicron metabolism be test by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 0 patient with coronary artery disease , aged 0+/-0 year , -lrb- total cholesterol : 0+/-0 mg/dl ; triglyceride : 0+/-0 mg/dl -rrb- submit to a randomized , crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled study with administration of 0 g per day drug0 or placebo for 0-month . 
a 0-month washout period be insert between the treatment period . 
patient be intravenously inject a chylomicron-like emulsion doubly label with 0c-cholesteryl oleate and 0h-triolein at baseline and after treatment . 
after drug0 treatment , there be decrease of total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma level and a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma level . 
drug0 elicit 0 % enhancement of post- drug0 lipolytic activity and 0 % increase of 0h-triglyceride fractional clearance rate compare with placebo treatment . 
0c-cholesterol ester fractional clearance rate be 0 % great after drug0 than after placebo . 
therefore , a potent effect of drug0 on both chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal be achieve , indicate that this drug can be use to improve this metabolism in future prospective study . 
selective survival in drug0 and drug0 of pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype o0 from drug addict . 
the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa , particularly serotype o0 , in drug0 and drug0 
be evaluate as a possible explanation for the association of deep-seated infection with this organism and abuse of these drug . 
the mean reduction of growth cause by the drug be 0-fold great for 0 pseudomonas strain from normal subject than for 0 strain from drug addict -lrb- 0 vs. 0 log of reduction at 0 hr , p less than 0 -rrb- . 
a common phenotypic subset of the serotype o0 strain from drug addict be especially resistant to the inhibitory effect . 
#crd# strain of staphylococcus aureus -lrb- a frequent cause of infection in drug0 , but not in drug0 and drug0 , addict -rrb- be completely inhibit by the drug combination . 
dose-response curve -lrb- derive from the result of use the tablet as well as pure powder -rrb- show that drug0 be responsible for the inhibitory activity , which be partially antagonize by drug0 . 
we conclude that an ability of some p . 
aeruginosa serotype o0 strain , but not s . 
aureus , to survive in drug0 and drug0 may explain in part a shift from s . 
aureus to p . 
aeruginosa as common pathogen of drug addict in area where abuse of this combination of drug have increase . 
influence of coadministration of drug0 on drug0 pharmacokinetics and qtc interval in healthy volunteer . 
study objective : to evaluate the effect of drug0 on the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular safety of drug0 at steady state in healthy man . 
design : open-label , three-phase , sequential study . 
setting : clinical research center . 
subject : #crd# healthy male volunteer . 
interventions : each subject be treat accord to the following sequence : baseline ; 
phase 0 -lrb- day 0 -rrb- : drug0 0 mg 0 times/day ; 
washout -lrb- day 0 -rrb- ; 
phase 0 -lrb- day 0 -rrb- : drug0 0 mg/day ; 
and phase 0 -lrb- day 0 -rrb- : drug0 0 mg 0 times/day -lrb- day 0 -rrb- plus drug0 0 mg/day -lrb- day 0 -rrb- . 
measurement and main result : blood sample be draw and 0-lead electrocardiogram performed at specify time point after the last morning dose of drug0 in phase 0 and 0 . 
blood sample also be take before morning dose on the #ord# , #ord# , and #ord# day of phase 0 and 0 . 
electrocardiogram be do at baseline and on the last day of the washout period and phase 0 . 
coadministration of drug0 significantly decrease drug0 plasma concentration . 
there be no clinically significant change in corrected qt interval during administration of drug0 alone or with drug0 . 
drug0 be well tolerate when administer alone or with drug0 . 
conclusion : drug0 can be administer safely to patient receive low therapeutic dosage of drug0 . 
activity of drug0 alone and in combination with drug0 and drug0 against cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture . 
the in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity of drug0 alone and in combination with drug0 and drug0 be investigate . 
drug0 show moderate activity , which increase with increase concentration to 0 % suppression of growth at 0 microm . 
moreover , its activity be enhance when it be combine with either drug0 or drug0 with 0 % parasite reduction at the high concentration test . 
drug0 may be active in inhibit cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either drug0 or drug0 . 
modification of surface histidine residue abolish the cytotoxic activity of drug0 . 
drug0 display both cytotoxic and enterotoxic activity . 
it have recently be demonstrate that drug0 exert its cytotoxic effect by the glucosylation of the small gtp-binding protein of the rho family . 
drug0 , at ph 0 , be use to chemically modify expose histidine residue on drug0 . 
modification of drug0 with drug0 abolish both its cytotoxic activity and the ability of the toxin to bind zn-sepharose gel . 
treatment of drug0 with -lsb- -lrb- 0 -rrb- c -rsb- - drug0 reveal concentration dependent labelling of histidine residue on the toxin molecule . 
the effect of drug0 could be reverse by drug0 treatment . 
these datum suggest the modified histidine residue on drug0 be critical to its cytotoxic activity . 
histidine modification have no effect on the glucosyl transferase enzyme activity of drug0 . 
however , modification abolish the ' cold ' binding of toxin to bovine thyroglobulin in an elisa and reduce ligand binding activity in a rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination assay . 
the datum suggest that the histidine residue may be crucial to the receptor-binding activity of drug0 . 
expose histidine on drug0 be available for drug0 chelation , and these have be exploit in the development of a novel purification protocol for drug0 use drug0 -chelating chromatography . 
interaction of drug0 and drug0 in vitro . 
the minimal inhibitory concentration of drug0 and drug0 alone and in combination be determine by a microdilution method for 0 aerobic , facultative , and anaerobic clinical isolate . 
all 0 strain of staphylococcus aureus , diplococcus pneumoniae , streptococcus pyogenes , and anaerobic bacteria -lrb- except for #crd# strain of clostridium -rrb- be inhibit by 0 mug or less of drug0 per ml . 
drug0 do not interfere with the activity of drug0 within the range of concentration test -lrb- 0 to 0 mug/ml -rrb- ; 
for some strain combination be synergistic . 
sixty-two -lrb- 0 % -rrb- of 0 strain of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa be inhibit by 0 mug or less of drug0 per ml . 
combination of drug0 and drug0 be indifferent for 0 strain and synergistic for 0 strain . 
all 0 strain of enterococcus , #crd# strain of clostridium , #crd# strain of escherichia coli , and #crd# strain of proteus rettgeri be resistant to both drug0 -lrb- minimal inhibitory concentration great than 0 mug/ml -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- minimal inhibitory concentration great than 0 mug/ml -rrb- . 
combination of drug0 and drug0 be indifferent for 0 and synergistic for 0 of the resistant strain . 
except for drug0 -sensitive isolate , synergy be usually observe only at concentration of #crd# or both drug which be not readily obtainable in vivo . 
antagonism be never observe . 
drug0 and the common cold . 
evaluation of its efficacy and toxicity . 
we review the clinical datum relate to the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic dose of drug0 in the prevention and treatment of the common cold . 
although #crd# study tentatively support the hypothesis that such dose of drug0 may be efficacious , a #ord# study by the same group do not confirm the significant finding , and no clear , reproducible pattern of efficacy have emerge from the review of all the evidence . 
similarly , there be currently little adequate evidence on either the presence or the absence of serious adverse reaction to such dose of drug0 , although many such reaction have be hypothesize . 
the unrestricted use of drug0 for these purpose cannot be advocate on the basis of the evidence currently available . 
effect of drug0 in a light/dark test in mouse and the contribution of adenosine receptor . 
we investigate the effect of adenosine receptor antagonist , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , in a light/dark test in mouse . 
all antagonist decrease the time spent in the light zone in this test , which suggest that these compound have anxiogenic effect . 
the anxiogenic effect of drug0 be reduce by pretreatment with drug0 , an a0-selective agonist , but not by drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , an a0-selective agonist . 
however , the antagonism of the drug0 -induced anxiogenic effect by drug0 be only observe in the time spent in the light zone , and drug0 -induced anxiogenic effect be neither reverse by drug0 nor by drug0 . 
finally , it be notable that xanthine-derived adenosine antagonist test here commonly show anxiogenic effect in the light/dark test in mouse . 
it be suggest that there be a minor contribution of adenosine receptor to these effect , although drug0 -induced anxiogenic effect be antagonize by an a0 receptor agonist . 
restoration of drug0 susceptibility in enterococcus faecalis by antiresistance determinant gene transfer . 
we assess the ability of gene transfer to reverse drug0 resistance in class a -lrb- vana -rrb- glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecalis . 
recombinant shuttle vector contain a vanh promoter-vana antisense gene cassette fully restore drug0 susceptibility through a combined transcriptional activator binding domain decoy and inducible vana antisense rna effect . 
induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cell in response to drug0 and drug0 . 
0 , drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , the active metabolite of drug0 , be a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . 
we have show that mcf-0 cell treat with 0 nm drug0 exhibit characteristic apoptotic morphology -lrb- pyknotic nucleus , chromatin and cytoplasmic condensation , nuclear matrix protein reorganization -rrb- within 0 h . 
in the experiment report here , we examine the interaction between drug0 and the drug0 drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , which also induce apoptosis in mcf-0 cell . 
our datum suggest that drug0 significantly potentiate the reduction in cell number induce by drug0 alone . 
combined treatment with drug0 and drug0 enhance the degree of apoptosis assess use morphological marker that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation . 
we have select a subclone of mcf-0 cell resistant to drug0 -lrb- mcf-0d0res -rrb- . 
these cell express the vitamin d receptor and exhibit double time comparable to the parental mcf-0 cell , even when grow in 0 mm drug0 . 
treatment of both parental and resistant mcf-0 cell with drug0 induce apoptosis and clusterin . 
these datum emphasize that apoptosis can be induce in mcf-0 cell either by activation of drug0 -mediated signalling or disruption of drug0 -dependent signalling . 
cholinergic role in drug0 's effect on evoke potential in visual cortex of the albino rat . 
photic evoke potential be record from the visual cortex of chronically implant albino rat . 
since photic evoke potential component be representation of neural pathway which be activate during photic stimulation , study of the effect of drug0 on these component may help to trace pathway which be affect by drug0 . 
in the present study , evoke potential be record at 0 , 0 , and 0 min follow ip injection of saline , drug0 -lrb- 0 g/kg -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- or drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- on separate day . 
drug0 depress the amplitude of most evoke potential component in comparison to saline administration . 
component p0 , however , be increase in amplitude . 
drug0 briefly reduce the amplitude of most component , include p0 . 
in contrast , drug0 increase the amplitude of component p0 and p0 , while decrease component n0 , n0 and n0 for vary duration of time . 
drug0 pretreatment augment the depressant effect of drug0 on the early component p0 and n0 , while attenuate drug0 's influence on component p0 and p0 . 
pretreatment with drug0 likewise far reduce the amplitude of component p0 and n0 , and produce a similar effect on component n0 . 
drug0 , either alone or in combination with drug0 , produce approximately the same degree of enhancement of component p0 . 
in comparison to saline value , all #crd# agent produce reliable increase in peak latency for most of the component , with only n0 show no effect . 
the amplitude datum from this study suggest that drug0 's augmentation of component p0 may result , at least in part , from alteration in cholinergic function . 
increase hepatotoxicity of drug0 by concomitant administration of drug0 in the rat . 
since drug0 be frequently co-administered with drug0 , it be of clinical interest to study the effect of drug0 on the hepatotoxicity of drug0 . 
in male sprague-dawley rat fast for 0 h , concomitant administration of drug0 -lrb- 0 g/kg , i.p. -rrb- 
as judge by increase serum enzyme activity and increase incidence of hepatic necrosis . 
careful observation on hepatotoxicity be suggest when drug0 be prescribe with drug0 . 
dual effect of drug0 on the drug0 -induced contraction and norepinephrine release in the guinea-pig vas deferens . 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , c0h0n0o0 , isolate from marine coelenterate of palythoa tuberculosa , cause a #ord# rapid contraction followed by the slow phasic contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens . 
in the presence of drug0 -lrb- 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m -rrb- fail to cause the #ord# contraction ; 
however , the #ord# contraction be potentiate . 
in the presence of drug0 -lrb- 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m -rrb- , the #ord# contraction be inhibit selectively . 
when drug0 be apply to the muscle in the presence of drug0 , both #ord# and #ord# contractile response to drug0 be abolish . 
when the muscle be expose to the potassium-depleted solution , the #ord# contractile response to drug0 be rather potentiate . 
drug0 cause the release of norepinephrine from the muscle . 
exposure of the muscle to drug0 -lrb- 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- m -rrb- markedly increase the drug0 -induced release . 
it be indicate that the #ord# and #ord# contractile response to drug0 have entirely different property . 
the #ord# response be due to a release of norepinephrine from nerve and be potentiate by drug0 through the increase in the norepinephrine release , whereas the #ord# response be not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and be inhibit by drug0 . 
the mechanism of the action of drug0 be discuss in the relation with na , k-atpase . 
analgesic effect of drug0 . 
the literature provide considerable evidence indicate that several , but not all drug0 , be indeed drug0 and some be drug0 as well . 
those for which effectiveness be report include drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
the proposed mechanism of analgesic action of drug0 be review and discuss . 
the literature suggest that more than #crd# mechanism of action exist for them . 
there be considerable evidence suggest that histaminergic and serotoninergic central pathway be involve in nociception and that drug0 drug can modulate their response -lrb- 0 -rrb- . 
the evidence for a role for norepinephrine and dopamine and the effect of drug0 on them be less well establish . 
still other pathway have be propose . 
a great understanding of pain mechanism will aid in elucidate the role of drug0 in analgesia . 
effect of drug0 on voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- channel subtype in bovine chromaffin cell . 
in previous report we have show that drug0 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- channel in neuronal cell . 
however , these study do not show whether drug0 -induced inhibition of ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- current discriminate among the various ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- channel subtype , although it be know that there be at least #crd# different ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- channel subtype in neuronal cell . 
in this study we investigate the effect of drug0 on high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- channel subtype use their drug0 drug0 -lrb- l-type -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- n-type -rrb- , or drug0 -lrb- p-type -rrb- in bovine chromaffin cell . 
we could observe that drug0 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- current in a dose-dependent manner . 
the ic -lrb- 0 -rrb- be about 0 microgram/ml . 
drug0 have no effect on drug0 response . 
these datum suggest that drug0 be negatively couple to #crd# type of calcium channel in bovine chromaffin cell , include an drug0 -sensitive -lrb- n-type -rrb- channel , an drug0 -sensitive -lrb- p-type -rrb- channel and drug0 / drug0 / drug0 -resistant -lrb- presumptive q-type -rrb- channel . 
thus , the selective regulation of voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- subtype by drug0 in bovine chromaffin cell could be the cellular basis of antistress effect induce by drug0 . 
a proposed mechanism for the potentiation of camp-mediated acid secretion by drug0 . 
acid secretion in isolate rabbit gastric gland be monitor by the accumulation of -lsb- -lrb- 0 -rrb- c -rsb- drug0 . 
stimulation of the gland with drug0 synergistically augment the response to dibutyryl camp . 
the augmentation persist even after drug0 be wash out and be resistant to chelate extracellular ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- and to inhibitor of either protein kinase c or calmodulin kinase ii . 
drug0 at 0 microm preferentially block the secretory effect of drug0 and its synergism with camp , whereas it have no effect on histamine- or camp-stimulated acid secretion within 0 min . 
drug0 inhibit the drug0 -stimulated intracellular ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- concentration -lrb- -lsb-ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- -rrb- increase due to release from the ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- store . 
treatment of the gland with drug0 redistribute type 0 inositol 0-trisphosphate receptor -lrb- the major subtype in the parietal cell -rrb- from the fraction contain membrane of large size to the microsomal fraction , suggest a dissociation of the store from the plasma membrane . 
these finding suggest that intracellular ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- release by cholinergic stimulation be critical for determine synergism with camp in parietal cell activation and that functional coupling between the ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- store and the receptor be maintain by actin microfilaments . 
phenytoin intoxication induce by drug0 . 
a patient have phenytoin intoxication after administration of drug0 , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . 
the serum concentration of drug0 increase dramatically from 0 to 0 microg/ml when drug0 be coadministered , although the daily dosage of drug0 and other drug0 have not change . 
during drug0 and fluvoxamine treatment , ataxia , a typical side effect of drug0 , be observe . 
the genotype of drug0 and 0c0 , the enzyme responsible for phenytoin metabolism , be homozygous for the wild-type allele -lrb- drug0 * 0/ * 0 and 0c0 * 0/ * 0 -rrb- . 
the interaction may be a result of inhibition of both drug0 and 0c0 by drug0 . 
pharmacokinetic evaluation of the drug0 - drug0 interaction . 
drug0 be know to raise serum drug0 level . 
this study be design to evaluate the pharmacokinetic basis of this interaction in 0 normal subject . 
the pharmacokinetic variable for drug0 be determine after a 0 mg intravenous dose of drug0 in each subject , before and after oral drug0 , 0 mg daily for 0 week . 
during drug0 administration , systemic clearance of drug0 be reduce from 0 +/- 0 ml/min -lrb- mean +/- standard deviation -rrb- to 0 +/- 0 ml/min -lrb- p less than 0 -rrb- . 
this be due to reduction in both renal clearance -lrb- from 0 +/- 0 to 0 +/- 0 ml/min -rrb- -lrb- p less than 0 -rrb- and nonrenal clearance -lrb- from 0 +/- 0 to 0 +/- 0 ml/min -rrb- -lrb- p less than 0 -rrb- . 
drug0 half-life of elimination be prolonged from 0 +/- 0 to 0 +/- 0 hour -lrb- p less than 0 -rrb- . 
drug0 volume of distribution be not significantly change . 
drug0 cause a three- to fivefold increase in serum reverse triiodothyronine level , but change in thyroid function be not quantitatively related to the change in drug0 pharmacokinetics . 
these alteration in drug0 pharmacokinetics produce by drug0 explain the increase in serum drug0 level that have be observe when this drug combination have be use clinically . 
activation of an effector immediate-early gene arc by drug0 . 
as immediate-early gene -lrb- iegs -rrb- be think to play a critical role in mediate stimulus-induced neural plasticity , ieg response induce by drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- have be characterize to define the change in gene expression that may underlie its long-lasting behavioral effect . 
although activation of several transcription factor iegs have be describe , little be know about effector iegs . 
here , we have examine whether drug0 administration affect expression of an effector ieg arc -lrb- activity-regulated , cytoskeleton-associated -rrb- that encode a protein with homology to spectrin . 
use in situ hybridization , we observe that drug0 cause a rapid and transient dose-dependent increase in arc mrna level in the striatum and cortex that be abolish by pretreatment with the specific dopamine d0 receptor antagonist drug0 but not by an drug0 drug0 . 
drug0 induce arc mrna in layer iv and vi of the cortex which dopamine receptor be localize to . 
these result suggest that d0 receptor be couple to activation of arc gene , which may be involve in functional or structural alteration underlie neural plasticity trigger by drug0 . 
differential action of intrathecal drug0 on block the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug0 and drug0 in rat . 
in the present study , it be propose that the drug0 apply to supraspinal brain site produce their analgesic effect by the activation of different descending pain inhibitory system . 
the blockade of the spinal endorphinergic system by intrathecal drug0 on the production of tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug0 and drug0 be then study . 
intraventricular injection of drug0 and drug0 produce an inhibition of the tail-flick response to the heat stimulus in rat . 
intrathecal injection of drug0 at dose of 0 to 0 microgram cause a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induce by intraventricular injection of drug0 , and a high dose of drug0 -lrb- 0 microgram -rrb- completely block the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug0 -lrb- 0 microgram -rrb- . 
on the other hand , intrathecal drug0 -lrb- 0 microgram -rrb- have only a very weak effect on the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug0 -lrb- 0 microgram -rrb- . 
intraventricular injection of drug0 at dose of 0 to 0 microgram equally antagonize in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug0 and drug0 . 
the result indicate that a spinal drug0 -sensitive endorphinergic system be involve in the production of drug0 but not drug0 -induced tail-flick inhibition , and suggest that intraventricular drug0 and drug0 elicit their pharmacological action via the activation of different descending pain inhibitory system ; 
descending epsilon and mu system for drug0 and drug0 , respectively , be propose . 
pharmacological treatment of depression : the role of drug0 . 
depression be reach epidemic proportion in the western world . 
with each successive generation more people be become more severely depress at a young age . 
drug interaction : how to identify them . 
interaction between theraputic agent have be recognize as increasingly important cause of drug at their usual recommend dose may , under certain condition , produce toxicity of life-endangering proportion . 
while the recognition of drug toxicity result from interaction be of importance to all physciains , it be especially so for the clinician responsible for the welfare of those in the aerospace environment .

guideline be provided to assist the clinician in his logical approach to the identification of drug interaction when serious drug toxicity be encounter in a pateint . 
only with knowledge of the interaction can the therapeutic regimen be alter so as to provide therapeutic level of necessary drug while avoid toxicity . 
change in urinary homocysteine follow drug0 and drug0 administration to rat . 
the present work involve the administration of both drug0 and drug0 to group of rat , followed by determination of the homocysteine excretion rate in urine . 
the result indicate that a statistically significant difference exist between the excreted level of homocysteine in the urine of both control and drug0 -treated rat and the level show by rat treat with drug0 . 
the implication of these result be discuss , especially with respect to observation which indicate that homocysteine may be a precipitate factor in the development of thrombosis . 
also include in this paper be a study which confirm the identity of the hplc peak as be homocysteine by form a radioactive derivative of this particular sulphydryl-containing amino acid , and then analyse the result mixture by tlc . 
effect of drug0 and drug0 on the antinociceptive effect of drug0 , drug0 and drug0 in mouse . 
the influence of drug0 and drug0 on antinociceptive effect of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- be investigate in a mouse model use the tail-flick and hot-plate test . 
all drug be inject intraperitoneally . 
drug0 be administer to mouse 0 min before apply the drug0 . 
measurement of nociception be performed within 0 h after drug0 administration . 
drug0 at dose of 0 mg/kg and 0 mg/kg inject with drug0 be find to decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug0 . 
similarly , drug0 decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug0 -lrb- only in the tail-flick test -rrb- and drug0 . 
drug0 use at dose of 0 mg/kg and 0 mg/kg decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug0 , drug0 -lrb- only in the tail-flick test -rrb- and drug0 . 
-lsb-the effect of drug0 on the renal excretion of drug0 and drug0 in dog -rsb- the intravenous injection of drug0 in a dose of 0 mg/kg enhance drug0 and drug0 excretion in chronic canine experiment . 
the high drug0 and drug0 excretion be due to their increase renal tubular secretion . 
in dog , drug0 unchanged the secretion of drug0 , a test agent for anionic transport . 
possible extrarenal mechanism of action of drug0 on drug0 and drug0 transport be also examine . 
differential regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cell by drug0 , a homodimeric disintegrin , and monomeric disintegrins drug0 and drug0 . 
the homodimeric disintegrin drug0 be compare directly to the monomeric disintegrins drug0 and drug0 for the ability to affect protein tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cell . 
it be observe that drug0 have a dramatic effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of several protein in t0 human bladder cancer cell , include robust induction of phosphorylation of protein in the range of 0 kda . 
drug0 alone have no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in t0 cell , but dose-dependently inhibit the effect of drug0 when both be add simultaneously . 
among the protein that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to drug0 treatment be cas , a 0 kda adapter protein involve in integrin signaling . 
drug0 alone be find to have no effect on ca , but can completely block drug0 -induced phosphorylation of this protein in mda-mb-0 cell . 
these observation strongly suggest that the homodimeric structure of drug0 functionally distinguish it from other monomeric member of the disintegrin family .

neurochemical and functional consequence follow drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and drug0 . 
the neurochemical and functional consequence follow drug0 administration to the rat be evaluate and compare to similar effect follow drug0 administration . 
it be observe that drug0 induce long lasting depletion of striatal dopamine concentration and this neurotoxic effect could be prevent by drug0 pretreatment . 
the drug0 -induced neuronal damage produce a tolerance to the disruptive effect of drug0 and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effect of drug0 in rat respond in a schedule controlled paradigm . 
drug0 , like drug0 , produce depletion of striatal dopamine but these action be potentiate by drug0 pretreatment . 
these observation be discuss in reference to possible deleterious effect follow the administration of drug0 to patient with parkinson 's disease . 
response to drug0 of the perfused pancreas of the genetically diabetic chinese hamster . 
nonketotic , genetically diabetic cinese hamster show subnormal pancreatic insulin release and impaired suppression of glucagon in response to glucose . 
to study the pancreatic effect of other agent , dynamic insulin and glucagon release be measure from the in vitro perfuse pancreas of normal and diabetic chinese hamster in response to various combination of drug0 -lrb- 0mm -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 or 0 mg. per 0 ml. -rrb- , and drug0 -lrb- 0 mm -rrb- . 
drug0 alone cause identical insulin and glucagon release in diabetic and normal . 
drug0 , alone and in the presence of drug0 , cause subnormal insulin release and less suppression of glucagon release in the diabectics than in the normal . 
drug0 , in the presence of drug0 and drug0 , cause excessive glucagon release but nearly normal insulin release in the diabetic . 
drug0 , in the absence of drug0 or drug0 , cause excessive glucagon release in the diabetic and undetectable insulin release in either diabetic or normal . 
pancreatic content after perfusion do not correlate with release during perfusion . 
infusion of drug0 alone markedly decrease the amount of extractable pancreatic insulin and glucagon . 
these result indicate that the pancreatic alpha cell of the diabetic chinese hamster respond excessively to drug0 , as be see in the human diabetic . 
this defect be not related to acute insulin release or the presence of drug0 . 
far , these result confirm that the diabetic chinese hamster 's alpha and beta cell respond normally to drug0 , but be relatively insensitive to drug0 . 
interference of biocytin with drug0 -evoked hyperpolarization and membrane property of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neuron . 
in our laboratory , preliminary whole-cell , tight seal recording of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neuron include biocytin in the patch pipette yield a significantly small proportion of neuron hyperpolarized by drug0 compare with recording without biocytin . 
therefore , we investigate the effect of biocytin inclusion on drug0 response and other membrane property during whole-cell , tight seal recording of these neuron . 
the percentage of neuron hyperpolarized by drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 be significantly reduce when 0 % but not &lt ; 
or 0 % biocytin be include in the recording pipette , compare with neuron record without biocytin . 
however , a significantly high proportion of neuron fire spontaneous action potential with either 0 or 0 % biocytin compare to no biocytin . 
resting membrane potential , input impedance and the proportion of neuron display transient outward rectification be each significantly alter for neuron record with 0 % but not 0 % biocytin . 
these effect may be due to a relatively specific blockade of diverse potassium channel type . 
because efficient labeling can be achieve with 0 % biocytin with whole-cell recording , high concentration be contraindicate . 
drug0 : in vitro evaluation of its permeation enhancing effect on peptide drug . 
the purpose of this study be to evaluate the effect of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- conjugate on the intestinal permeation of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and model peptide drug , drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 be covalently link to carbodiimide activated drug0 . 
iodometric titration of the polymer conjugate be use to determine the extent of immobilised drug0 . 
permeation study be performed on guinea pig small intestinal mucosa mount in ussing-type chamber . 
unmodified drug0 -lrb- 0 % m/v -rrb- significantly improve the transport ratio -lrb- r= p -lrb- app -rrb- polymer/ p -lrb- app -rrb- control -rrb- of drug0 to 0 and 0 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- drug0 conjugate with drug0 far enhance the permeation . 
drug0 conjugation at 0 , 0 and 0 % -lrb- m/m -rrb- result in r-values of 0 , 0 and 0 , respectively . 
decrease the concentration of drug0 , exhibit 0 % -lrb- m/m -rrb- of immobilised drug0 -lrb- cmc-cys0 -rrb- from 0 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- to 0 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- decrease the r-value of drug0 from 0 to 0 . 
drug0 at 0 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- in the presence of free drug0 have no significant effect on the r-value of drug0 compare to drug0 alone . 
formulation of fluorescence labelled drug0 and drug0 in unconjugated drug0 -lrb- 0 % m/v -rrb- do not significantly improve the permeation , however in the presence of 0 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- drug0 0 a significantly improve permeation be observe -lrb- r= 0 -rrb- . 
conjugation at drug0 with drug0 moiety significantly improve the intestinal permeation of the hydrophilic molecule drug0 and the model peptide drug drug0 and drug0 in vitro , therefore this conjugate system maybe useful for peroral administration of peptide drug in the future . 
effect of low temperature on microtubule in the non-myelinated axon of post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve . 
the effect of temperature change on the number of microtubule in non-myelinated axon have be study in cat inferior mesenteric ganglion/hypogastric nerve preparation incubate at various temperature in eagles minimal essential tissue culture medium in vitro . 
at 0 degree c the non-myelinated axon contain 0 plus or minus 0 s.e.m. 
-lrb- 0 -rrb- microtubule per axon . 
after incubation at 0 degree c for 0 h this number fall to 0 plus or minus 0 s.e.m. 
-lrb- 0 -rrb- but return to normal level when the nerve be rewarm . 
this loss of microtubule on cool the nerve and their reappearance on rewarming be a rapid process ; 
it be independent of the influence of the nueronal cell body and of protein synthesis within the axon . 
the preservation of the microtubule be improve when d0o be present in the incubation medium . 
reformed microtubule appear to function normally with respect to their possible role in the transport of noradrenaline storage vesicle along the axon .

heart rate increase initially and return to normal 0 minute after drug0 challenge . 
intestinal absorption of drug0 in the chick . 
the intestinal absorption of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- have be investigate in the chick by mean of the in situ ligate duodenal loop technique . 
by this procedure , it be observe that drug0 be rapidly and essentially completely absorb -lrb- 0 % -rrb- from the lumen at drug0 concentration up to 0 mm , decline to about 0 % absorption at 0 mm . 
transfer from the intestinal lumen to the mucosal cell at low drug0 concentration -lrb- 0 mm -rrb- be rapid , while transfer from the mucosal cell to the body occur more slowly . 
at stable drug0 concentration great than 0 mm , fractional mucosal cell accumulation of drug0 remain constant , while fractional transfer to the body decline . 
however , total mucosal accumulation of drug0 and that transfer to the body increase in a linear logarithmic fashion from 0 to 0 mm drug0 . 
the result indicate that drug0 readily penetrate both the mucosal and serosal surface of the epithelial membrane . 
furthermore , drug0 and drug0 do not appear to share a common transport pathway in the duodenum and no evidence be obtain for any interaction between the #crd# at this level . 
drug0 administration to rachitic chick be effective in significantly elevate duodenal drug0 absorption , act primarily to enhance serosal transport . 
drug0 : an updated review of its use in the management of schizophrenia . 
drug0 , a drug0 , be a drug0 which have proven efficacy against the positive and negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
compare with drug0 , it have great affinity for serotonin 0-ht0a than for dopamine d0 receptor . 
in large , well control trial in patient with schizophrenia or related psychosis , drug0 0 to 0 mg/day be significantly superior to drug0 0 to 0 mg/day in overall improvement in psychopathology rating scale and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptom , and be comparable in effect on positive psychotic symptom . 
the 0-year risk of relapse -lrb- rehospitalisation -rrb- be significantly low with drug0 than with drug0 treatment . 
in the #ord# double-blind comparative study -lrb- 0-week -rrb- of drug0 and drug0 , drug0 0 to 0 mg/day prove to be significantly more effective than drug0 0 to 0 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptom but not on overall psychopathology symptom . 
in contrast , preliminary result from an 0-week controlled study suggest drug0 0 to 0 mg/day be superior to drug0 0 to 0 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptom -lrb- p &lt ; 0 -rrb- , although consistent with the #ord# study , both agent demonstrate similar efficacy on measure of overall psychopathology . 
improvement in general cognitive function see with drug0 treatment in a 0-year controlled study of patient with early-phase schizophrenia , be significantly great than change see with either drug0 or drug0 . 
however , preliminary result from an 0-week trial show comparable cognitive enhancing effect of drug0 and drug0 treatment in patient with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder . 
several study indicate that drug0 have benefit against symptom of aggression and agitation , while other study strongly support the effectiveness of drug0 in the treatment of depressive symptomatology . 
drug0 be associate with significantly few extrapyramidal symptom than drug0 and drug0 . 
in addition , drug0 be not associate with a risk of agranulocytosis as see with drug0 or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as see with drug0 or prolongation of the qt interval . 
the most common adverse effect report with drug0 be bodyweight gain , somnolence , dizziness , anticholinergic effect -lrb- constipation and dry mouth -rrb- and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation . 
in comparison with drug0 , the adverse event report significantly more frequently with drug0 in > or = 0 % of patient be dry mouth , bodyweight gain and increase appetite and compare with drug0 , only bodyweight gain occur significantly more frequently with drug0 . 
the high acquisition cost of drug0 be offset by reduction in other treatment cost -lrb- inpatient and/or outpatient service -rrb- of schizophrenia . 
pharmacoeconomic analysis indicate that drug0 do not significantly increase , and may even decrease , the overall direct treatment cost of schizophrenia , compare with drug0 . 
compare with drug0 , drug0 have also be report to decrease overall treatment cost , despite the several-fold high daily acquisition cost of the drug . 
drug0 treatment improve quality of life in patient with schizophrenia and related psychosis to a great extent than drug0 , and to broadly the same extent as drug0 . 
conclusion : drug0 demonstrate superior antipsychotic efficacy compare with drug0 in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia , and in the treatment of some patient with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia . 
the reduce risk of adverse event and therapeutic superiority compare with drug0 and drug0 in the treatment of negative and depressive symptom support the choice of drug0 as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response . 
antimicrobial activity of drug0 alone and in combination with some drug0 . 
antimicrobial activity of drug0 -lrb- the aqueous extract from the carpophore of ganoderma lucidum -lrb- fr -rrb- karst -rrb- be test in vitro against gram positive and gram negative bacteria by serial broth dilution method , and the antimicrobial activity be express by minimal inhibitory concentration -lrb- mic -rrb- . 
among #crd# species of bacteria test , the antimicrobial activity of drug0 be the most potent against micrococcus luteus -lrb- mic , 0 mg/ml -rrb- . 
to investigate the effect of antimicrobial combination of drug0 with #crd# kind of drug0 -lrb- drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and drug0 -rrb- , the fractional inhibitory concentration index -lrb- fici -rrb- be determine by checkerboard assay for each strain . 
the antimicrobial combination of drug0 with #crd# drug0 result in additive effect in most instance , synergism in #crd# instance , and antagonism in #crd# instance . 
synergism be observe when drug0 be combine with drug0 against bacillus subtilis and klebsiella oxytoca . 
drug0 protect mouse tumour and normal tissue from the toxicity of oral drug0 . 
because the drug0 drug0 be give exclusively by the oral route in man , we have carry out study in mouse on the antitumour activity , acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral drug0 , either alone or in combination with the chemosensitizer drug0 . 
in both plasma and kht tumour the peak concentration and &quot ; early&quot ; 
auc for total drug0 be about 0 fold great for the oral compare to the i.p. 
route . 
these difference be reflect in the roughly twofold great antitumour activity for the oral route . 
in contrast , acute toxicity test show that oral drug0 be 0 time less toxic to normal tissue , although the dose-limiting organ may be different for the #crd# route . 
drug0 reduce the antitumour activity of oral drug0 by dose modifying factor -lrb- dmf -rrb- of 0 . 
similarly , the acute toxicity be also diminish by a dmf of 0 . 
drug0 have a complex effect on oral drug0 pharmacokinetics . 
the plasma and tumour total drug0 peak concentration be reduce by 0 and 0 fold respectively . 
drug0 also reduce the &quot ; early&quot ; 
drug0 auc , with the extent of the reduction depend on the minimum effective concentration -lrb- mec -rrb- choose . 
for example , the plasma drug0 auc be reduce by factor of 0 and 0 for mec value of 0 and 0 microgram ml-0 respectively . 
we propose these pharmacokinetic change to be the underlie mechanism for the reduction of oral drug0 cytotoxicity by drug0 . 
clinical trial of such combination should be accompany by detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation . 
pharmacokinetic interaction between single oral dose of drug0 and drug0 in healthy volunteer . 
aim and background : the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug0 , a drug0 metabolize by cyp0a0 , and the drug0 drug0 be study in 0 healthy subject . 
several clinically important interaction have previously be report for other drug0 that be metabolize by the same enzyme and for drug0 . 
method : healthy subject who be 0 to 0 year old participate in an open , three-period , randomized , crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of a single 0-mg oral dose of drug0 , a single oral 0-mg dose of drug0 , and the #crd# drug give together . 
the #crd# study period be separate by a 0-day washout phase . 
result : the geometric mean -lrb- 0 % confidence interval -rrb- whole blood drug0 area under the plasma concentration time-curve increase 0 % -lrb- 0 % 0 % -rrb- , from 0 to 0 ng x h/ml , and maximum concentration increase 0 % -lrb- 0 % 0 % -rrb- , from 0 to 0 ng/ml , with drug0 coadministration , whereas the mean elimination half-life of drug0 decrease slightly , from 0 to 0 hour . 
apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of drug0 decrease with 0 % and 0 % , respectively , when drug0 be give with drug0 . 
the plasma maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 be unchanged after coadministration of drug0 , and no potentiation of the effect of drug0 on diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameter be see . 
conclusion : single-dose drug0 coadministration lead to high drug0 exposure , presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of drug0 . 
because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the drug0 - drug0 interaction , whole blood drug0 concentration should be monitor closely in patient treat with the #crd# drug . 
drug0 , a trans-0-dimethyl-0- -lrb- 0-hydroxyphenyl -rrb- piperidine , prevent gastrointestinal effect of intravenous drug0 without affect analgesia . 
drug0 be a novel drug0 that may selectively prevent drug0 -induced gastrointestinal effect without reverse analgesia . 
gastrointestinal transit time -lrb- lactulose hydrogen breath test -rrb- be measure in 0 volunteer with oral and intravenous placebo , oral placebo and intravenous drug0 -lrb- 0 mg x kg -lrb- 0 -rrb- -rrb- , and oral drug0 -lrb- 0 mg -rrb- and intravenous drug0 -lrb- 0 mg x kg -lrb- 0 -rrb- -rrb- in a double blind , cross-over study . 
drug0 prolong gastrointestinal transit time from 0 to 0 minute -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- ; 
drug0 prolong gastrointestinal transit time from 0 to 0 minute -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- ; this be prevent by drug0 -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- . 
postoperatively , 0 patient be randomly assign in a double-blind fashion to receive drug0 -lrb- 0 mg -rrb- or placebo and intravenous drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- or to receive oral and intravenous placebo . 
analgesia and pupil constriction be measure . 
drug0 analgesia and pupil constriction be unaffected by drug0 and differ from placebo -lrb- p &lt ; 0 -rrb- . 
we conclude that drug0 prevent drug0 -induced increase in gastrointestinal transit time by mean of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affect central opioid analgesia . 
the effect of drug0 , drug0 and drug0 on bar-press behavior in normal and genetically nervous dog . 
study on #crd# strain of pointer dog have demonstrate that administration of a drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- facilitate acquisition of goal-directed behavior in &quot ; genetically nervous&quot ; 
subject . 
continued admistration of the drug be require to maintain barpress response in this strain of dog . 
the concomitant administration of either drug0 or drug0 , compound which inhibit neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine , disrupt the behavioral response of the genetically nervous e-strain subject to a far great extent than the stable a-strain subject . 
it be also show that after 0 day of daily administration of drug0 , withdrawal of the drug not only re-results in almost complete loss of bar-press response in the e-strain subject but also result in a temporary decrease in the acquire behavioral response of the stable a-strain subject . 
therapeutic drug monitoring can avoid iatrogenic alteration cause by drug0 -lrb- mdp -rrb- - drug0 interaction . 
drug0 be an drug0 use to treat a wide variety of infection cause by gram-negative organism , but it be potentially toxic to the kidney . 
due to its nephrotoxicity , drug0 may cause abnormal renal uptake to be see on drug0 bone scintigraphy . 
the presence of the drug0 in the kidney , along with an increase in renal retention , tend to produce scintigraphic result that falsely identify characteristic related to disease such as renal vascular , or urinary tract obstruction , and even renal cancer . 
an altered biodistribution may provide misleading information that can either mask or mimic certain disease symptom . 
a method to maximize the therapeutic benefit of drug0 while minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity and the appearance of a hot kidney on scintigraphy be desirable . 
serial pharmacokinetic dosing have be propose as a method to accomplish this goal . 
therapeutic drug monitoring -lrb- tdm -rrb- of drug0 therapy , and bone scintigraphy employ drug0 as the drug0 be carry out in 0 patient . 
the datum present here demonstrate that with serial pharmacokinetic dosing of drug0 , the iatrogenic alteration cause by drug0 therapy can be avoid . 
interaction of drug0 and drug0 in anaesthetised horse . 
evoke hind limb digital extensor tension -lrb- hoof twitch -rrb- be maintain at 0 % of baseline for 0 h by drug0 infusion in 0 horse anaesthetised with drug0 . 
after 0 h , drug0 be discontinue and hoof twitch allow to recover to 0 % . 
drug0 be again give by infusion to maintain 0 % twitch for a #ord# hour , then 0 mg drug0 /kg bwt be give i.v. 
drug0 infusion be continue for a #ord# hour , and then hoof twitch be again allow to recover spontaneously to 0 % . 
drug0 reduce twitch strength from 0 +/- 0 % -lrb- mean +/- sem -rrb- to 0 +/- 0 % within 0 +/- 0 min -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- . 
twitch gradually return to pre- drug0 strength over the course of the next hour . 
recovery of hoof twitch from 0 % to 0 % take 0 +/- 0 min for drug0 alone and 0 +/- 0 min for drug0 plus drug0 -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- . 
recovery from 0 % twitch to 0 % fade recovery take 0 +/- 0 min for drug0 alone and 0 +/- 0 min for drug0 plus drug0 . 
at 0 % recovery of fade , hoof twitch be 0 +/- 0 % for drug0 alone and 0 +/- 0 % for drug0 plus drug0 . 
reversal of the block with drug0 and subsequent recovery of the horse from anaesthesia be uneventful . 
it be conclude that , although drug0 do augment the neuromuscular blockade of drug0 , the effect be minimal . 
diagnostic , treatment and aftercare approach to drug0 abuse . 
the general public feel that drug0 be not particularly dangerous because it do not produce a well define physical dependency and abstinence syndrome . 
however , when addiction be define as compulsion , loss of control and continued use in spite of adverse consequence , drug0 drug hunger can be see as an agent of addictive disease . 
withdrawal from drug0 dependence usually involve depression , anxiety and lethargy . 
these usually clear within a week , leave only the &quot ; drug hunger&quot ; 
to contend with . 
medication be rarely need . 
when drug0 be the primary addiction , after withdrawal the most effective treatment be group therapy with other recovering cocaine abuser . 
we incorporate the principle of recovery and define positive and constructive alternative in deal with cocaine hunger . 
recovery program should be flexible and involve individual and family education on recovery and the nature of addictive disease . 
exercise that produce cardiopulmonary stimulation be a helpful means of reduce drug hunger and anxiety during recovery therapy . 
systemic drug0 . 
understand the breadth of systemic drug0 available for use by the dermatologist and their associated side-effect profile and drug interaction allow the clinician to offer patient optimal care in the management of cutaneous infectious disease . 
alter responsiveness to drug0 after exposure to organic lead . 
drug0 be know to effect the functional integrity of the limbic system , particularly the hippocampus , and to alter behavior which be think to be mediate through limbic function . 
organometals also compromise the limbic system and result in deficit in learning and memory . 
since both drug0 and organoleads be present in the environment and seem to influence limbic integration , the interaction of these #crd# compound be assess in the present experiment . 
#crd# male rat of the fischer-0 strain be divide into #crd# equal group and be give injection of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -lrb- 0 or 0 mg/kg/ml sc -rrb- or the saline vehicle . 
#crd# day later , all animal be challenge with a single hypnotic dose of drug0 -lrb- 0 g/kg ip -rrb- . 
the 0 % v/v solution of drug0 be prepare in water from a stock solution of 0 % drug0 . 
the latency to loss of the righting reflex and duration of sleep time be record while the rat be keep in sound-attenuating chamber . 
the rat treat with the high dose of drug0 manifest significantly long latency to lose the righting reflex and short duration of sleep than do control . 
these result suggest that exposure to environmental drug0 may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to drug0 . 
evidence for reduction of drug0 uptake site in the failing human heart . 
objective . 
this study investigate the role of neuronal uptake of drug0 -lrb- uptake-0 -rrb- in human heart failure as a local factor for alter concentration of norepinephrine at the cardiac myocyte membrane . 
background . 
several beta-adrenergic neuroeffector defect occur in heart failure . 
whether an alteration in drug0 uptake-0 occur be still unresolved . 
method . 
the role of drug0 uptake-0 be study in electrically stimulate -lrb- 0 hz , 0 degree c -rrb- human ventricular cardiac preparation and isolate myocardial membrane . 
result . 
the effectiveness of drug0 in increase the force of contraction be decrease in relation to the degree of heart failure . 
in contrast , the potency of drug0 be increase in failing heart -lrb- new york heart association functional class iv -rrb- in relation to the concentration produce 0 % of the maximal effect -lrb- ec0 -rrb- . 
the ec0 value for drug0 , which be not a substrate for drug0 uptake-0 , be reduce in myocardium in functional class ii to iii and iv compare with those in nonfailing myocardium . 
the uptake inhibitor drug0 and drug0 -lrb- 0 mumol/liter -rrb- potentiate the positive inotropic effect of drug0 in nonfailing myocardium -lrb- p &lt ; 0 -rrb- but not in functional class iv myocardium . 
radioligand binding experiment use the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-0 drug0 reveal a significant decrease by approximately 0 % in drug0 uptake-0 carrier density in functional class ii to iii and iv myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium -lrb- p &lt ; 0 -rrb- . 
conclusion . 
in human heart failure , there be a presynaptic defect in the sympathetic nervous system , lead to reduce uptake-0 activity . 
this defect in the failing heart can be mimic by the effect of uptake blocking agent , such as drug0 and drug0 , in the nonfailing heart only . 
compromise drug0 uptake-0 in functional class iv cannot be far increase by drug0 and drug0 . 
the pathophysiologic consequence could be an increase synaptic concentration of drug0 predispose to adenylyl cyclase desensitization . 
the mechanism of drug0 -induced vasorelaxation differ in the mesenteric resistance artery of lean and obese rat . 
drug0 have be show to induce vasorelaxation . 
in this study , we investigate the mechanism -lrb- s -rrb- of drug0 -induced vasorelaxation in resistance mesenteric artery from male lean and dietary-induced obese rat . 
compare with lean rat , artery from dietary-obese rat show significant -lrb- p&lt ; 0 -rrb- endothelial dysfunction , as indicate by a decrease -lrb- >0 % -rrb- in maximal acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation . 
drug0 -lrb- 0 micromol/l -rrb- induce concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric artery preconstricted with drug0 -lrb- 0 micromol/l -rrb- or drug0 -lrb- 0 mmol/l -rrb- from both lean and dietary-obese rat . 
there be no significant difference between the #crd# group , achieve a maximum relaxation of >0 % at a concentration of 0 micromol/l . 
however , drug0 -lrb- 0 and 0 micromol/l -rrb- do not alter the effect of drug0 on artery from dietary-obese rat , give superimposed concentration-responses curve . 
drug0 be also ineffective in alter drug0 activity in artery from both lean and dietary-obese rat . 
in drug0 -precontracted artery from dietary-obese rat , response to drug0 be not attenuate by endothelial denudation , indicate an action independent of the endothelium . 
this study indicate that : -lrb- a -rrb- the maximal effect of drug0 on resistance artery from lean and dietary-obese rat be not effect by endothelial dysfunction , and -lrb- b -rrb- the effect of drug0 in lean animal -lrb- where endothelial function be not impaired -rrb- , but not in dietary-obese rat , be mediate via no . 
drug0 : an iga-binding lectin . 
we previously report that seed of artocarpus integrifolia -lrb- jackfruit -rrb- contain a lectin , which we call drug0 , that be both a potent t cell mitogen and an apparently t cell-independent activator of human b cell for the secretion of immunoglobulin . 
during the above experiment we note a massive precipitation in cell culture stimulate with great than or equal to 0 microgram of lectin . 
in this paper , we show that the precipitate be form after the interaction of drug0 and the serum protein add to the culture medium . 
more importantly , we demonstrate that iga be probably the major serum constituent precipitate by the lectin and that no igg or igm can be detect in the precipitate . 
in secretion such as colostrum , iga be the only protein precipitate by drug0 . 
on the basis of this specificity we describe a simple and reliable affinity chromatography procedure for the purification of both human serum and colostrum iga . 
drug0 be a d-gal binding lectin and should be a useful tool for study of serum and secretory iga . 
-lsb-0 epidemics of arsenical encephalopathy in the treatment of trypanosomiasis , uganda , 0 -rsb- since 0 , the french non-governmental organisation m decins sans fronti res be run a control program of human african trypanosomiasis in the district of moyo , north-uganda . 
between 0 and 0 , more than 0 patient be diagnose and treat . 
since 0 , it have be note that incidence of drug0 reaction have increase systematically between june and october of each year , indicate strong seasonal variation . 
in 0 and 0 , #crd# outbreak of arsenical reactive encephalopathy -lrb- be -rrb- occur in the sleeping sickness center of adjumani . 
the incidence of be suddenly exceed 0 % of the patient treat by drug0 during august 0 and september 0 . 
the onset of 0 % of those &quot ; epidemic&quot ; 
case , occur between the #ord# and the #ord# day of treatment . 
#crd# retrospective study be conduct in 0 -lrb- 0 case -rrb- and in 0 -lrb- 0 case -rrb- . 
among the risk factor study , #crd# appear to increase the risk of be : the prescription of drug0 to treat strongyloidiasis during the drug0 cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patient . 
these observation suggest that exogenous co-factors could be involve in the occurrence of be . 
recommendation be to avoid administration of diffusible drug0 treatment during the cure , and to improve the general condition of patient before the cure of drug0 . 
behavioral response to repeated drug0 exposure in mouse selectively breed for differential sensitivity to drug0 . 
mouse from the #ord# generation of #crd# line divergently select for response to drug0 -induced sedation time -lsb-long-sedation time -lrb- lst -rrb- , short sedation time -lrb- sst -rrb- , and randomly breed control -lrb- rbc -rrb- -rsb- be use to study drug0 -induced behavioral sensitization . 
these line show variable degree of locomotor activity in response to drug0 . 
at a low drug0 dose and long withdrawal period -lrb- 0 mg/kg , twice a day for 0 day followed by a 0-day withdrawal -rrb- , the lst mouse show tolerance development . 
in response to drug0 , the locomotor activity of the sst be not significantly different from the rbc group . 
at a high dose and a short withdrawal period -lrb- 0 mg/kg , daily for 0 day followed by a 0-day withdrawal -rrb- , the sst mouse show behavioral sensitization similar to the rbc mouse , but the lst mouse do not develop sensitization . 
the different response in locomotor activity induce by drug0 suggest that genetic factor may play a role in determine the magnitude of response to this drug . 
dopamine -lrb- da -rrb- level do not differ significantly in either striatum -lrb- str -rrb- or nucleus accumbens -lrb- nac -rrb- for the drug0 -treated animal to their corresponding saline-treated control . 
the affinity -lrb- kd -rrb- of d0 in the nac decrease significantly , without change in density -lrb- bmax -rrb- , in the drug0 -treated sst and rbc mouse . 
on the other hand , the density of d0 binding site in the sst and the rbc mouse in the str be significantly increase in drug0 -treated group without change in kd . 
the lst mouse do not show any change in the kd and bmax in either the str or the nac . 
take together , these finding suggest that the change in the kd of d0 in the nac and the bmax of d0 in the str may contribute to the difference in locomotor response to drug0 exposure in these mouse line . 
drug0 inhibit the cyp0c0 catalyze biotransformation of drug0 . 
objective : our objective be to examine the interaction between drug0 and drug0 to confirm that drug0 inhibit cyp0c0 . 
method : the study be carry out as an open , randomized , crossover design with 0 healthy participant . 
in period a , all volunteer take 0 mg of drug0 orally . 
in period b , the volunteer be randomly assign to #crd# of #crd# group . 
each group take either 0 mg or 0 mg of drug0 a day for 0 day -lrb- day 0 to day 0 -rrb- . 
the group then take 0 mg of drug0 as a single dose -lrb- day 0 -rrb- . 
in both period , blood and urine be sample at regular interval . 
plasma be analyze for drug0 , and urine be analyze for drug0 and its #crd# metabolite , drug0 and drug0 by mean of hplc . 
result : during treatment with drug0 , there be a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of drug0 , from 0 ml/h to 0 ml/h , among the volunteer who receive 0 mg/d . 
there be a reduction that reach borderline statistical significance in the group that receive 0 mg/d of drug0 . 
the clearance by mean of drug0 and drug0 be significantly reduce in both group -lrb- ie , from 0 ml/h to 0 ml/h in the group that receive 0 mg of drug0 per day and from 0 ml/h to 0 ml/h in the group that receive 0 mg of drug0 per day -rrb- . 
thus there be a tendency toward a more pronounced inhibition of the 0-hydroxylation during treatment with 0 mg/d of drug0 compare with 0 mg/d , but the difference be not statistically significant . 
conclusion : drug0 be a moderate inhibitor of cyp0c0 in vivo . 
influence of drug0 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism . 
available datum indicate that platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism be important factor in hemostasis and regulation of vascular tone . 
plasma membrane and intracellular mobilization of calcium ion be intimately related to platelet activation and release of platelet content . 
release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid as well as subsequent synthesis and release of vasoconstrictor thromboxane a0 be also regulate by movement of calcium ion . 
adenosine 0 ' : 0'-cyclic phosphate in turn control level of free calcium ion in platelet and regulate calcium-dependent reaction . 
drug0 , such as drug0 , drug0 and drug0 , inhibit platelet activation in vitro , and decrease platelet adhesion intravascularly . 
these agent have also be show to decrease platelet nucleotide release and thromboxane a0 generation . 
some preliminary datum suggest that drug0 also increase generation of vasodilator and platelet antiaggregant prostacyclin , which could contribute to decrease in platelet function . 
these effect of drug0 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism could contribute in part to their efficacy in patient with ischemic heart disease . 
pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular drug in patient with chronic renal disease . 
cardiovascular disease be a common comorbidity and a major cause of mortality in patient with chronic renal disease . 
drug regimen in patient with cardiovascular disease be frequently complex and can be significantly affect by alteration in renal function . 
in addition , several cardiovascular drug directly affect renal function and the management of patient with renal disease . 
this article review the impact of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of cardiovascular drug and identify clinically important interaction between these and other drug commonly use in the management of chronic renal disease . 
several class of cardiovascular drug be also discuss in relationship to their differential effect on the management and progression of renal disease . 
influence of drug0 and drug0 on the sensitivity of rat thoracic aorta to drug0 . 
the aim of this study be to investigate the effect of low and high dose of drug0 , and of drug0 on the response to drug0 in rat thoracic aorta . 
#crd# week after bilateral ovariectomy , female rat receive a s.c. 
injection of vehicle -lrb- corn oil , 0 ml/day -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 microg/kg/day or 0 mg/kg/day -rrb- and/or drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg/day -rrb- , for #crd# day . 
on the #ord# day , the rat be sacrifice and aortic ring , with or without endothelium , be use to generate concentration-response curve to drug0 . 
aortic ring with intact endothelium from the high-dose -lrb- 0 mg/kg/day -rrb- drug0 group be supersensitive to drug0 compare to the vehicle or low-dose -lrb- 0 microg/kg/day -rrb- estradiol group -lrb- pd0 value = 0+/-0 , 0+/-0 and 0+/-0 , respectively -rrb- . 
endothelium-intact aortic ring from high- drug0 rat be supersensitive to drug0 when compare to vehicle- , drug0 - and drug0 + high- drug0 -treated rat -lrb- pd0 value = 0+/-0 , 0+/-0 , 0+/-0 and 0+/-0 , respectively -rrb- . 
there be no significant difference among the pd0 value for drug0 in aortic ring without endothelium . 
both of these effect be endothelium-dependent . 
drug0 and therapeutic . 
#crd# different type of therapy with drug0 be use : physiological oral drug0 supplementation which be totally atoxic since it palliate drug0 deficiency by simply normalize the drug0 intake and pharmacological drug0 therapy which may induce toxicity since it create iatrogenic drug0 overload . 
primary and secondary drug0 deficiency constitute the sole indication of physiological oral drug0 therapy . 
it be therefore necessary to be well acquainted with the clinical and paraclinical pattern of drug0 deficit and to discriminate between drug0 deficiency due to an insufficient drug0 intake which only require oral physiological supplementation and drug0 depletion related to a dysregulation of the control mechanism of drug0 status which require more or less specific regulation of its causal dysregulation . 
physiological oral drug0 load constitute the good tool for diagnosis of drug0 deficiency and the #ord# step of its treatment . 
physiological oral drug0 supplementation -lrb- 0 mg/kg/day -rrb- be easy and can be carry out in the diet or with drug0 s , with practically only #crd# contra-indication : overt renal failure . 
specific and aspecific treatment of drug0 depletion be tricky use for example drug0 , pharmacological dose of drug0 , physiological dose of drug0 and of drug0 . 
in order to use the pharmacological property of induced therapeutic hypermagnesaemia , high oral dose of drug0 -lrb- > 0 mg/kg/day -rrb- be advisable for chronic indication and the parenteral route be suitable for acute indication . 
there be 0 type of indication : specific -lrb- for the treatment of some form of drug0 deficit i.e. acute -rrb- , pharmacological -lrb- i.e. without alteration of drug0 status -rrb- and mixed--pharmacological and aetiopathogenic-- -lrb- for example complication of chronic alcoholism -rrb- . 
today pharmacological drug0 therapy mainly concern the obstetrical , cardiological and anaesthesiological field . 
the main indication be eclampsia , some dysrhythmia -lrb- torsades de pointe particularly -rrb- and myocardial ischaemias . 
but it be now difficult to situate the exact place of the pharmacological indication of drug0 . 
drug0 infusion can only be envisage in intensive care unit with careful monitoring of pulse , arterial pressure , deep tendon reflex , hourly diuresis , electrocardiogram and respiratory recording . 
high oral drug0 dose besides their laxative action may bring latent complication which may reduce lifespan . 
there may remain some indication of the laxative and antacid property of non soluble drug0 , particularly during intermittent haemodialysis . 
lastly local use of the mucocutaneous and cytoprotective property of drug0 be still valid , in drug0 and for preservation of transplant particularly . 
the effect of drug0 and drug0 upon drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -induced locomotion and behavioral change in mouse . 
the behavioral change of mouse induce by acute and repeated i.p. 
injection of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- be observe by measure locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior . 
then , the effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor -lrb- mglur -rrb- agonist , drug0 and drug0 , on the above behavioral change induce by drug0 be find . 
the effect of drug0 be very strong and completely depress the drug0 -induced hyperlocomotion . 
the effect of drug0 be not so strong . 
repeated injection of drug0 for 0 day into mouse induce low locomotor activity than that in acutely inject mouse . 
these behavioral change may be related with the negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
in order to examine some molecular mechanism of drug0 -induced behavioral change , northern blot analysis of total rna from prefrontal cortical tissue of mouse treat with drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 be carry out . 
lack of an effect of drug0 on the disposition of drug0 and drug0 in hiv-infected patient . 
#crd# study be conduct in hiv-infected subject to assess the potential for drug0 to interact with drug0 and drug0 . 
both study use 0 subject . 
the drug0 study dose subject with 0 mg/day of drug0 -lrb- n = 0 -rrb- -lrb- later change to 0 mg/day -lsb-n = 0 -rsb- -rrb- for day 0 to 0 of a 0-day course of 0 mg , #crd# times/day of drug0 . 
subject treat with 0 mg of drug0 twice daily for 0 day receive 0 mg of drug0 or an equivalent amount of placebo/day for day 0 to 0 . 
drug0 plasma and urine sampling be conduct on day 0 , 0 , and 0 for drug0 and on day 0 and 0 for drug0 . 
peripheral mononuclear cell be also collect for quantitation of phosphorylated drug0 . 
drug0 have no significant impact on the cmax and auc of drug0 , although it significantly decrease the drug0 tmax by 0 % and increase the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated drug0 by 0 % . 
drug0 have no significant effect on drug0 pharmacokinetics . 
base on the result of these study , it be conclude that drug0 may be safely coadministered with both drug0 and drug0 . 
clinical implication of drug0 interaction with #crd# drug0 . 
the intensity , uniformity and time course of drug0 interference by drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and drug0 be systematically investigate in 0 patient receive drug0 therapy . 
each subject receive an individualized fixed daily dose of drug0 and serve as his own pre- and postsedative treatment control . 
prothrombin time be measure #crd# time weekly during #crd# long-term experiment . 
anticoagulant inhibition be observe during the administration of drug0 , drug0 and drug0 ; 
there be no significant change in prothrombin test result during the trial of drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 and drug0 should not be administer to patient receive drug0 . 
the concurrent use of drug from these group be decrease accord to a survey of 0 hospital medical record . 
drug0 and drug0 interact pharmacologically with orally administer drug0 , but the effect be not clinically significant . 
it be conclude that drug0 and drug0 may be administer safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral drug0 therapy . 
interaction of the constituent of alcoholic beverage in the promotion of liver damage . 
little have be study of the adverse effect of the exposure of the liver to the interaction of drug0 with its congener and drug0 , coexist in the content of alcoholic beverage . 
#crd# #crd# male wistar rat be divide into #crd# group . 
#crd# group -lrb- sh/da ; sh/fa -rrb- be submit to daily treatment with synthetic hydroalcoholic solution contain drug0 , drug0 , high drug0 and drug0 in the same proportion as those find in most common distilled and fermented alcoholic beverage ; 
the #ord# group -lrb- sh/ea -rrb- be treat with a hydroalcoholic solution of drug0 ; 
the #ord# group serve as control and receive an equivalent volume of an isocaloric solution of drug0 . 
all the animal be kill at the end of the #ord# week of the experiment . 
the ratio between the liver weight and body weight be find to be low in the treated animal than in the control group . 
the histology of the liver be alter in the #crd# group which be submit to treatment with the hydroalcoholic solution , with quantitative and qualitative difference between the group . 
these result suggest that the hepatoxicity of drug0 in alcoholic beverage be enhance by interaction with its congener and drug0 ; 
they also suggest that alcoholic beverage be not equivalent in their potential to cause liver damage . 
administration of drug0 prophylaxis . 
successful prophylaxis of manic-depressive disorder require more than the prescription of drug0 . 
the administrative arrangement in an area of scotland be accompany by a 0 % increase in the frequency of admission for mania , whereas in an area of the west midlands , a large decrease be achieve . 
effect of drug0 on the pharmacokinetics of drug0 in healthy volunteer . 
the author examine the effect of the cyclooxygenase-0 -lrb- cox-0 -rrb- inhibitor , drug0 , at steady state on the pharmacokinetics of drug0 follow a single dose in healthy subject . 
each healthy subject -lrb- n = 0 -rrb- receive drug0 -lrb- 0 mg once daily -rrb- or placebo for 0 day in a double-blind , randomized , balanced , two-period crossover study . 
a single 0 mg oral dose of drug0 elixir be administer on the #ord# day of each 0-day period . 
each treatment period be separate by 0 to 0 day . 
sample for plasma and urine immunoreactive drug0 concentration be collect through 0 hour follow the drug0 dose . 
no statistically significant difference between treatment group be observe for any of the calculate drug0 pharmacokinetic parameter . 
for drug0 auc -lrb- 0-infinity -rrb- , auc -lrb- 0 -rrb- , and cmax , the geometric mean ratio -lrb- 0 % confidence interval -rrb- for -lrb- drug0 + drug0 /placebo + drug0 -rrb- be 0 -lrb- 0 , 0 -rrb- , 0 -lrb- 0 , 0 -rrb- , and 0 -lrb- 0 , 0 -rrb- , respectively . 
the drug0 median tmax be 0 hour for both treatment . 
the harmonic mean elimination half-life be 0 and 0 hour for drug0 + drug0 and placebo + drug0 treatment , respectively . 
drug0 be eliminate renally . 
the mean -lrb- sd -rrb- cumulative urinary excretion of immunoreactive drug0 after concurrent treatment with drug0 or placebo be 0 -lrb- +/- 0 -rrb- and 0 -lrb- +/- 0 -rrb- micrograms/0 hour , respectively . 
transient and minor adverse event occur with similar frequency on placebo and drug0 treatment , and no treatment-related pattern be apparent . 
drug0 do not influence the plasma pharmacokinetics or renal elimination of a single oral dose of drug0 . 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and drug0 : comparison of antiaddictive efficacy , toxicity , and mechanism of action . 
drug0 , a novel iboga alkaloid congener , be be develop as a potential treatment for multiple form of drug abuse . 
like drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- decrease the intravenous self-administration of drug0 and drug0 and the oral self-administration of drug0 and drug0 in rat ; 
unlike drug0 , drug0 do not affect respond for a nondrug reinforcer -lrb- water -rrb- . 
both drug0 and drug0 ameliorate drug0 withdrawal sign . 
both drug0 and drug0 decrease extracellular level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens , but only drug0 increase extracellular level of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens . 
both drug0 and drug0 block drug0 -induced and drug0 -induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens ; 
only drug0 enhance drug0 -induced increase in accumbal dopamine . 
both drug0 and drug0 enhance the locomotor and/or stereotypic effect of stimulant . 
drug0 attenuate , but drug0 potentiate , the acute locomotor effect of drug0 ; 
both compound attenuate drug0 -induced locomotion in drug0 -experienced rat . 
drug0 produce whole body tremors and , at high dose -lrb- > or = 0 mg/kg -rrb- , cerebellar damage ; 
drug0 do not produce these effect . 
drug0 , but not drug0 , decrease heart rate at high dose . 
while drug0 and drug0 have similar affinity for kappa opioid and possibly nicotinic receptor , drug0 have much low affinity than drug0 for nmda and sigma-0 receptor , sodium channel , and the 0-ht transporter . 
both drug0 and drug0 be sequester in fat and , like drug0 , drug0 probably have an active metabolite . 
the datum suggest that drug0 have a narrower spectrum of action and will have a substantially great therapeutic index than drug0 . 
effect of coadministered drug and drug0 on the binding of therapeutic drug to human serum in vitro . 
the effect of coadministered drug and drug0 on the binding of therapeutic drug to human serum in vitro be investigate . 
drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 be add to pooled human serum at therapeutic concentration . 
to each preparation be add #crd# additional drug at #crd# concentration range from therapeutic to toxic . 
the following #crd# target drug/added drug combination be study : drug0 / drug0 . 
drug0 / drug0 , drug0 / drug0 , drug0 / drug0 , drug0 / drug0 , drug0 / drug0 , drug0 / drug0 , and drug0 / drug0 . 
each serum without the other add drug as well as the serum supplement with the other drug at the #crd# concentration be dialyze against phosphate buffer . 
similarly dialyze be drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 , both alone at therapeutic concentration in serum and with drug0 at #crd# different concentration in serum . 
the percentage of drug binding in each preparation be calculate . 
drug0 diminish the binding of drug0 to human serum by a net change of 0 % -lrb- percentage increase in free drug fraction -lsb-fdf -rsb- , 0 % -rrb- at 0 micromol/l and by a net change of 0 % -lrb- percentage increase in fdf , 0 % -rrb- at 0 micromol/l . 
drug0 decrease the binding of drug0 by a net change of 0 % -lrb- percentage increase in fdf , 0 % -rrb- at 0 micromol/l ; 
drug0 reduce it by a net change of 0 % -lrb- percentage increase in fdf , 0 % -rrb- at 0 micromol/l . 
drug0 diminish binding of drug0 by a net change of 0 % -lrb- percentage increase in fdf , 0 % -rrb- at 0 micromol/l . 
no significant effect be note with other drug combination or with the addition of drug0 . 
coingestion of drug0 with drug0 , drug0 with drug0 , and drug0 with drug0 at high to toxic concentration decrease the binding of the target drug . 
the result increase in free drug concentration may lead to enhance drug effect in vivo . 
effect of drug0 on the pharmacokinetics of drug0 . 
the effect of drug0 on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug0 be evaluate in a randomized , double-blind study . 
#crd# day of drug0 treatment do not significantly affect steady-state pharmacokinetic variable of drug0 compare with placebo ; 
therefore , the use of drug0 do not necessitate an adjustment in drug0 dose to maintain therapeutic digoxin level . 
acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of drug0 in anhydrous and aqueous drug0 solution . 
the drug0 be a family of drug0 and drug0 . 
when take concurrently with drug0 , a pharmacological interaction may occur , potentiate the central nervous system depression produce by either drug . 
in addition to this pharmacological interaction , this report describe a novel chemical reaction between drug0 -lrb- a drug0 -rrb- and drug0 under acidic condition similar to those find in vivo , result in a 0-ethoxylated product . 
optimal condition , kinetics , equilibrium , and the mechanism of this acid-catalyzed ethanolysis be report . 
the result raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume drug0 and drug0 on a regular basis . 
the acid-catalyzed drug0 -drug reaction be a relatively unexplored area and may alter the pharmacological action of some drug . 
inhibitory effect of drug0 on inositol 0 , 0-trisphosphate-induced response in rat megakaryocyte . 
the effect of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- on drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -induced response be study in rat bone marrow megakaryocyte with the patch-clamp whole-cell recording technique in combination with fura-0 microfluorometry . 
internal application of drug0 -lrb- 0 microm -rrb- increase intracellular ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- concentration -lrb- -lsb-ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- -rrb- and activate the ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- -dependent k -lrb- + -rrb- current . 
administer drug0 together with drug0 -lrb- 0 microm -rrb- inhibit insp -lrb- 0 -rrb- -induced response -lrb- both ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- and current response -rrb- in a dose-dependent fashion . 
pretreatment of megakaryocyte with extracellular drug0 -lrb- 0 microm -rrb- also inhibit drug0 -induced response . 
intracellular and extracellular application of drug0 reduce adp-induced increase in -lsb-ca -lrb- 0+ -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- . 
in contrast , in isolate single pancreatic acinar cell , drug0 have no effect on drug0 -induced response . 
take together , these result suggest that the site of the inhibitory action of drug0 be at the insp -lrb- 0 -rrb- receptor , or its closely associate protein . 
in addition , we have show that drug0 be a useful pharmacological tool with which to examine the drug0 -mediated response of megakaryocyte . 
concomitant drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 chemotherapy plus drug0 therapy in patient with human immunodeficiency virus-related , non-hodgkin lymphoma . 
background : the feasibility and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and drug0 therapy -lrb- haart -rrb- be still unknown in patient with human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- -related malignancy . 
to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy plus haart on the clinical course of patient with hiv-related , systemic , non-hodgkin lymphoma -lrb- hiv-nhl -rrb- , the author compare retrospectively a group of 0 patient with hiv-nhl who be treat with the drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -lrb- chop -rrb- chemotherapy regimen plus haart with a group of 0 patient who be treat with chop chemotherapy or a chop-like regimen -lrb- i.e. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 with drug0 plus drug0 -rrb- without receive drug0 therapy . 
method : all patient be enrol in #crd# sequential trial performed at the aviano cancer center , italy , from april 0 to december 0 . 
haart be include with combination therapy from january 0 . 
drug0 regimen consist of #crd# drug0 and #crd# drug0 . 
result : the #crd# treatment group be well match with regard to patient demographics , nhl characteristic , hiv status , and treatment , i.e. , the number of cycle and chemotherapy dose . 
the response rate be similar between the #crd# group . 
severe anemia -lrb- grade 0 accord to the world health organization criterion -rrb- be significantly great in the patient who receive chop-haart compare with the patient who receive chop alone -lrb- 0 % vs. 0 % , respectively ; p = 0 -rrb- . 
leukopenia be similar between the #crd# group , but colony stimulating factor support be significantly great in the chop-haart group than in the control group -lrb- 0 % vs. 0 % , respectively ; p = 0 -rrb- . 
#crd# percent of chop-haart patient develop severe autonomic neurotoxicity , whereas none of the chop patient develop neurotoxicity -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- . 
at similar median follow-up , opportunistic infection -lrb- oi -rrb- rate and mortality be significantly low in the chop-haart patient than in the chop patient -lrb- 0 % vs. 0 % , respectively ; p = 0 ; and 0 % vs. 0 % , respectively ; p = 0 -rrb- . 
the median survival for chop-haart patient be not reach , whereas the medial survival of chop patient be 0 month -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- . 
conclusion : the combination of chop plus haart be feasible and may reduce the morbidity from ois in hiv-nhl patient . 
however , careful attention must be direct to cross toxicity and possible pharmacokinetic interaction between drug0 and drug0 . 
the impact of the combined chemotherapy plus haart treatment on patient survival need urgently to be evaluate in prospective study . 
drug0 and drug0 : a drug interaction . 
the drug interaction between drug0 and drug0 be not well know . 
drug0 have be report to increase the drug0 requirement in human subject ingest these agent simultaneously . 
the concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 result in the need for an unusually high maintenance dose of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg per day -rrb- in order to produce a therapeutic effect . 
withdrawal of drug0 decrease the drug0 requirement by 0 % . 
this effect may be mediate by the ability of drug0 to induce microsomal enzyme and , thus , the catabolism of drug0 . 
the effect of drug0 on the drug0 requirement of our patient appear to be maximal 0 to 0 day after the initiation of drug0 and extend a similar length of time after drug0 withdrawal . 
this interaction appear to be clinically significant . 
increase stability of nucleophosmin/b0 in anti-apoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
we obtain evidence that increase stability of nucleophosmin/b0 be involve in antiapoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
nucleophosmin/b0 in serum-deprived -lrb- 0 % serum -rrb- nih-0t0 cell be find to be highly unstable with a half-life less than 0 h . 
in contrast , nucleophosmin/b0 in serum-deprived ras-transformed -lrb- ras-0t0 -rrb- cell be as stable as that in serum-supplemented nih-0t0 or ras-0t0 cell . 
treatment of ras-0t0 cell with nucleophosmin/b0 antisense oligomer significantly potentiate the apoptosis induce by serum deprivation . 
much less caspase-0 activity be note in the lysate derive from serum-deprived ras-0t0 cell compare with that in the lysate of serum-deprived nih-0t0 cell . 
cell permeable caspase-0 inhibitor add in the medium block the decrease of nucleophosmin/b0 and apoptosis induce by serum deprivation in nih-0t0 cell . 
the inhibitor , on the other hand , promote significant decrease of nucleolin/c0 in nih-0t0 cell during serum deprivation . 
unlike nucleolin/c0 , down-regulation of nucleophosmin/b0 be thus not proliferation-dependent but caspase-0- and apoptosis-dependent . 
our result indicate important relationship among ras , nucleophosmin/b0 , activation of caspase-0 , and induction of apoptosis . 
drug0 : mammalian target of drug0 inhibitor to prevent kidney rejection . 
current immunosuppressive therapy be effective but can be associate with significant adverse reaction . 
drug0 work differently from the drug0 currently available , and except for increase lipid level , the adverse reaction profile of drug0 do not appear to overlap to any great extent with that associate with drug0 or drug0 . 
while additional research be need , the initial clinical datum in kidney recipient suggest that drug0 , in combination with drug0 or drug0 , might have the potential to reduce the frequency of rejection episode , permit reduction in drug0 or drug0 dosage , and permit steroid withdrawal -lrb- kelly , 0 -rrb- . 
development and pharmacology of drug0 . 
drug0 be the #ord# drug0 to be approved for clinical use , and have be study extensively in human since 0 . 
it be structurally distinct from the other currently available drug0 -lrb- drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -rrb- , lead to unique biopharmaceutical property relative to the other agent of this class . 
absorption of drug0 be virtually complete across all species , include man , and be not affect by the presence of food . 
systemic exposure be limited , as drug0 be subject to first-pass metabolism , and the plasma half-life of the drug be approximately 0 minute . 
some 0 % of a single dosage of drug0 be excrete via the biliary route , with less than 0 % of this be the parent compound . 
additionally , there be no evidence of circulating active metabolite or accumulation during chronic dosing . 
study of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of drug0 have demonstrate marked reduction in the rate of bioavailability--from 0 % to 0 % ; 
however , a comparison of drug0 administration with the evening meal or at bedtime have reveal no significant difference in the extent of bioavailability -lrb- area under the curve -rrb- of these #crd# regimen . 
furthermore , no significant difference in pharmacodynamic effect -lrb- reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level -rrb- could be ascertain between mealtime dosing and bedtime dosing . 
the pharmacokinetics of drug0 have also be assess in various demographic group . 
relative to the general population , plasma concentration of drug0 do not vary as a function of either age or gender . 
in addition , administration to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency result in a 0-fold increase in both the rate and extent of bioavailability relative to control . 
also , although minimal alteration of drug0 clearance in patient with renal insufficiency be anticipate due to limited renal excretion -lrb- 0 % -rrb- , a study in this patient group be currently underway to examine this far . 
interaction study have be performed with drug0 and several drug with which it might be coadministered . 
drug0 , an anionic-binding resin , have a considerable effect in lower the rate and extent of drug0 bioavailability . 
although this effect be note even when drug0 be give 0 hour prior to drug0 , this regimen do not result in diminish efficacy . 
far , no effect on either drug0 level or prothrombin time be observe in a study involve concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 . 
moreover , additional interaction study with drug0 and drug0 have not demonstrate any effect on drug0 plasma level , and administration to a patient population chronically receive drug0 result in no difference in the extent of bioavailability of drug0 relative to control datum . 
the result generate to date in clinical pharmacokinetic study with drug0 thus support its use in a broad population of hypercholesterolaemic patient . 
molecular basis for the selective toxicity of drug0 for yeast and drug0 for animal cell . 
among the drug0 , many , like drug0 , cannot be use clinically because they be toxic ; 
drug0 , however , be useful in therapy of human fungal infection because it be less toxic . 
both the toxicity of drug0 and the therapeutic value of drug0 can be rationalize at the cellular and molecular level by the following observation : -lrb- i -rrb- these drug0 show differential effect on cell ; 
drug0 be more potent in lysing human red blood cell , whereas drug0 be more potent in inhibit yeast cell growth ; 
and -lrb- ii -rrb- the effect of drug0 be more efficiently inhibit by add cholesterol , the major membrane sterol in human cell , whereas the effect of drug0 be more efficiently inhibit by ergosterol , the major membrane sterol in yeast . 
the simple inference be that the toxicity and effectiveness of polyenes be determine by their relative avidity for the predominant sterol in cell membrane . 
-lsb-hippocampus as interaction site between cerebral memory system -rsb- most of the current theory assume that there be multiple form of memory that be support by separate brain system and have different characteristic . 
animal study on the various dual-memory theory have be carry out mainly on the basis of hippocampal system function . 
specifically , they have focus on aspect of learning and memory that be impaired -lrb- vs. spare -rrb- by lesion of the hippocampal formation . 
however , there be several instance in the animal literature show that hippocampal lesion actually produce enhance learning and memory function . 
moreover , the acquisition of task that be facilitate by hippocampal lesion -lrb- or dysfunction -rrb- be nevertheless associate , in intact subject , with specific neurobiological alteration in the hippocampus . 
this problem have be analyse use #crd# different task in mouse : a bar-press conditioning and a spatial discrimination task . 
result show that , depend on the task consider , the same pharmacological treatment produce either a facilitation or an impairment of acquisition . 
moreover , each task induce significant alteration in hippocampal adenylate cyclase activity but in opposite direction . 
together with previous finding , these result suggest that the hippocampus be involve in both the so-called &quot ; hippocampal-dependent&quot ; 
&quot ; hippocampal-independent&quot ; 
form of memory . 
it be postulate that some of the observe training-induced neurobiological alteration might reflect the interaction between #crd# -lrb- or more -rrb- compete memory system at the hippocampal level . 
thus , in addition to its proposed specific information processing function -lrb- i.e. , relational -rrb- , the hippocampus would play a role in address information to the brain memory system that , in a given situation , have the good adaptive value. -lrb- abstract truncate at 0 word -rrb- 
behavioral mechanism underlie the link between smoking and drinking . 
many people use both drug0 and drug0 -lrb- i.e. , cigarette and other tobacco product -rrb- . 
the behavioral effect of these #crd# drug differ , and they do not act on the same target site in the brain , although they may share , or partly share , certain property . 
the initiation of drug0 or drug0 use may be precipitated by similar personality characteristic in the user , such as impulsivity and sensation seeking . 
moreover , the mechanism underlie the development of dependence may be similar for drug0 and drug0 . 
thus , certain factor , such as reinforce drug effect , conditioning process , automatic behavior , and stress , may influence the development of dependence on both drug . 
other factor , such as tolerance and sensitization to the drug ' action and the development of withdrawal symptom , may also contribute to dependence . 
this review discuss the action of the #crd# drug on certain brain chemical -lrb- i.e. , neurotransmitter -rrb- system and the extent to which the effect of the #crd# drug may interact . 
vancomycin resistance reversal in enterococci by flavonoid . 
the development of clinical vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococci -lrb- vre -rrb- be a major cause for concern . 
here we show that a combination of drug0 or 0-dihydroxyflavone with drug0 may be use to sensitize resistant strain of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to the level of vancomycin-sensitive strain . 
minimum inhibitory concentration -lrb- mics -rrb- and viable count be determine in iso-sensitest broth use a microtitre method . 
mic of drug0 against 0 % of resistant clinical isolate and a type strain of enterococci be lower from > 0 microg ml -lrb- 0 -rrb- to 0 
0 microg ml -lrb- 0 -rrb- in the presence of drug0 -lrb- 0 microg ml -lrb- 0 -rrb- -rrb- or 0-dihydroxyflavone -lrb- 0 microg ml -lrb- 0 -rrb- -rrb- . 
viable count for type culture e . 
faecalis atcc 0 show the flavonoid alone significantly lowered number of colony form unit -lrb- cfus -rrb- . 
cfus be maintain at low level -lrb- 0 -lrb- 0 -rrb- cfu ml -lrb- 0 -rrb- -rrb- for 0 h by drug0 /flavone combination . 
this combinational action in reverse vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlight novel drug target and have importance in the design of new therapeutic regime against resistant pathogen . 
lack of interaction between drug0 and drug0 : pharmacokinetics and drug disposition . 
previous study have demonstrate a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of drug0 and drug0 when administer concomitantly with an intravenous drug0 such as drug0 . 
this decrease in absorption result in a 0 % and 0 % low auc for drug0 and drug0 , respectively , which could cause clinical failure . 
the author investigate the possibility of a similar interaction between drug0 and drug0 . 
#crd# healthy volunteer be randomize in an open-label , two-way crossover study to receive drug0 , 0 mg p.o. 
q0h , and drug0 , 0 mg p.o. 
0 hour after start the drug0 or drug0 0 mg p.o. 
alone . 
blood sample be draw at 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , and 0 hour for cmax , tmax , and auc determination . 
there be not a significant difference -lrb- p > 0 -rrb- in auc -lrb- 0 +/- 0 vs. 0 +/- 0 -rrb- , cmax -lrb- 0 +/- 0 vs. 0 +/- 0 -rrb- , and tmax -lrb- 0 +/- 0 vs. 0 +/- 0 -rrb- for drug0 versus drug0 / drug0 regimen . 
it be conclude that oral drug0 and drug0 can be administer concomitantly without a significant decrease in auc , cmax , or tmax . 
the mode of toxic action of the pesticide drug0 : the metabolism of drug0 to drug0 . 
the biochemical toxicology of drug0 , a known metabolite of the major ingredient of the pesticide drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , be investigate in vivo and in vitro . 
rat kidney homogenate supplement with coenzyme a , atp , oxaloacetate , and mg0+ convert drug0 to drug0 in vitro . 
administration of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg kg -lrb- 0 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to rat in vivo result in drug0 synthesis in the kidney , which be precede by an elevation in fluoride level and followed by citrate accumulation . 
animal dose with drug0 do not display the 0 hour lag phase in either drug0 synthesis or in citrate and fluoride accumulation characteristic of animal dose with drug0 . 
we demonstrate that the conversion of drug0 to drug0 by an nad+-dependent oxidation be the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the toxic product , drug0 from drug0 . 
prior administration of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg kg -lrb- 0 -rrb- body weight -rrb- be show to prevent the conversion of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg kg -lrb- 0 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to drug0 in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevation see in drug0 -intoxicated animal . 
however , administration of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg kg -lrb- 0 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to rat 0 hour prior to drug0 -lrb- 0 mg kg -lrb- 0 -rrb- body weight -rrb- be ineffective in prevent drug0 synthesis and do not diminish fluoride or citrate accumulation in vivo . 
we conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal property of drug0 see in animal treat with drug0 derive from its capacity to inhibit the nad+-dependent oxidation responsible for convert drug0 to drug0 in the commit step of the toxic pathway . 
drug0 -induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver be prevent by drug0 or drug0 . 
consider that the involvement of reactive oxygen species -lrb- ros -rrb- have be implicate in the toxicity of various pesticide , this study be design to investigate the possibility of oxidative stress induction by drug0 , a drug0 . 
either single -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- or repeated -lrb- 0 mg/kg per day for 0 day -rrb- oral administration of drug0 be find to produce significant oxidative stress in cerebral and hepatic tissue of rat , as be evident by the elevation of the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance -lrb- tbars -rrb- in both tissue , either 0 or 0 h after treatment . 
much high change be observe in liver , increase from a level of 0 % at 0 h up to nearly 0 time the control at 0 h for single dose . 
reduce level -lrb- up to 0 % -rrb- of total glutathione -lrb- total gsh -rrb- , and elevation of conjugate dienes -lrb- approximately 0 % in liver by single dose at 0 h -rrb- also indicate the presence of an oxidative insult . 
glutathione-s-transferase -lrb- gst -rrb- activity , however , do not differ from control value for any dose or at any time point in cerebral and hepatic tissue . 
pretreatment of rat with drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg , ip -rrb- or drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg per day , ig , for 0 day and a dose of 0 mg/kg on the #ord# day -rrb- provided significant protection against the elevation of tbars level in cerebral and hepatic tissue , induce by single high dose of oral drug0 administration within 0 h . 
thus , the result suggest that drug0 exposure of rat result in free radical-mediated tissue damage , as indicate by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation , which be prevent by drug0 and drug0 . 
serum drug0 level use an 0i-labelled antigen : validation of method and observation on cardiac patient . 
0 . 
determination of serum drug0 level utilize commercially available kit with an 0i-labelled antigen be precise and not materially different from result obtain with a 0h-labelled antigen . 
0 . 
in order to approximate the steady state level , serum drug0 level should be draw either before or at least #crd# hour follow the administration of an oral tablet . 
0 . 
concomitantly give drug0 do not interfere with the absorption of a tablet of drug0 . 
0 . 
in the digitalized patient , slow alteration in serum level after oral administration appear well correlate with , at least , the negative chronotropic effect of the drug . 
0 . 
maximal exercise testing , a maneuver often apply to cardiac patient , do not significantly alter the serum drug0 level . 
analysis of drug0 -induced diarrhea in cecectomized rat . 
the drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -induced diarrhea be analyze in cecectomized rat prepare by resect the cecum and its vasculature without disturb the ileocecal junction . 
drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- 
dose-dependently increase the number of defecation episode and induce a soft and watery stool in cecectomized rat . 
at 0 mg/kg , the diarrhea-inducing effect of drug0 be more pronounced in cecectomized than in control rat . 
when give i.p. , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- induce a watery stool in cecectomized and control rat with the same efficacy , although these effect be short-lasting as compare to oral administration . 
drug0 -lrb- 0 ml/kg , p.o. -rrb- 
also induce diarrhea , but do not produce a watery stool in cecectomized rat . 
there be no difference between cecectomized and control rat in basal small intestinal transit or in drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- -induced enhancement . 
moreover , the basal and drug0 -induced jejunal net fluid transfer be the same in cecectomized and in control rat . 
on the other hand , the enhance secretion of colonic fluid by drug0 , give intraluminally , be only half of that in control rat , whereas the colonic transit-enhancing effect of drug0 in cecectomized rat be more pronounced than in control rat at 0 but not at 0 min after its administration . 
the basal colonic fluid content and transit be the same in cecectomized and in control rat . 
drug0 and drug0 -lrb- 0 and 0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- 
drug0 and drug0 -lrb- 0 and 0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- inhibit the drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- -induced diarrhea in cecectomized rat . 
drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- 
drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- completely antagonize the inhibitory effect of drug0 and partly antagonize the effect of drug0 . 
these result suggest that oral administration of drug0 induce a more pronounced secretory diarrhea in cecectomized than in control rat , probably due to the lack of the reservoir function of the cecum in the operated animal . 
this secretory diarrhea model be suitable for evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of drug . 
drug0 as potent drug0 of glucocorticoid-induced mouse mammary tumor virus gene expression . 
the effect of natural and synthetic galloyl ester on glucocorticoid-induced gene expression be evaluate by use rat fibroblast 0y0 cell stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional regulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus drug0 . 
the glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription be strongly suppress by synthetic alkyl ester ; 
drug0 show the most potent inhibition -lrb- 0 % inhibition at 0 microm -rrb- , which be far more potent than that of crude drug0 . 
n-octyl and n-cetyl gallate also show good inhibition , while gallic acid itself be not so active , suggest that the presence of hydrophobic side chain be important for the suppressive effect . 
on the other hand , surprisingly , drug0 , -lrb- - -rrb- -epigallocatechin-0-o-gallate and theasinensin a , potently enhance the promoter activity -lrb- 0 and 0 % activity at 0 microm , respectively -rrb- . 
the regulation of the level of the glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by the antioxidative gallates be of great interest from a therapeutic point of view . 
high-dose drug0 with drug0 protection . 
nephrotoxicity frequently limit the dose of drug0 to less than 0 mg/m0 per injection . 
drug0 be a neutralizing agent for drug0 that protect against renal damage . 
to determine whether injection of drug0 would permit large dose of drug0 to be administer , a fixed 0-g/m0 dose of drug0 be give intravenously over #crd# hour concurrently with escalating dose of drug0 . 
drug0 be administer over the last #crd# hour of the drug0 infusion . 
use this technique , it be possible to escalate the drug0 dose to 0 mg/m0 before dose-limiting toxicity be encounter . 
comparison of drug0 pharmacokinetics in patient treat with 0 mg/m0 plus drug0 to those in patient treat with 0 mg/m0 without drug0 indicate that there be no change in the elimination rate constant , volume of distribution , or total body clearance of drug0 . 
the total drug exposure for the plasma be approximately twofold at the high drug0 dose . 
this study demonstrate that concurrent administration of drug0 permit at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to drug0 . 
interaction on the antinociceptive effect between drug0 and drug0 or drug0 . 
the aim of this paper be to study the interaction between drug0 and both drug0 or its synthetic analogue drug0 , or drug0 , on the antinonciceptive effect of these peptide in mouse after intracisternal injection . 
antinociception be measure by the hot-plate method . 
it be show that drug0 antagonize evidently the antinociceptive effect of drug0 and their analogue . 
on the contrary , drug0 and drug0 be agonist in induction of analgesia . 
it be conclude that drug0 modulate in an opposite way the function of the enkephalinergic neuron and the central action of drug0 . 
the emerge role of drug0 in drug0 therapy . 
the availability of potent drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -based regimen for drug0 therapy and concern regard drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -related metabolic disturbance have lead to significant shift in treatment practice in hiv infection . 
drug0 -based regimen may have several advantage over drug0 -based therapy for initial or prolonged therapy , include more convenient administration regimen , low tablet volume , few drug interaction , and central nervous system penetration . 
no datum from prospective clinical trial currently exist compare the 0 approved agent -lrb- drug0 , drug0 or drug0 -rrb- . 
both drug0 and drug0 have be compare to triple therapy with the drug0 drug0 over 0 week as initial therapy , with similar response be observe with drug0 regimen and superiority observe with drug0 . 
a small 0-week study have suggest drug0 may be superior to the drug0 drug0 . 
limited comparative datum in patient with high viral load treat with drug0 - or drug0 -based regimen currently exist . 
however , cohort datum and select patient datum from clinical trial suggest comparable activity to drug0 -based regimen in these patient . 
the superiority of drug0 over drug0 -based regimen have be observe in comparative datum in a subset of patient with high viral load . 
in treatment-experienced patient , available uncontrolled datum suggest these agent contribute to regimen efficacy in drug0 -na ve , treatment-experienced patient . 
drug0 have demonstrate superiority over drug0 in nucleoside-experienced patient , although combine these 0 agent may represent the good approach in these circumstance . 
the tolerability of drug0 appear generally good with few individual discontinue in clinical study as a result of adverse drug event . 
the majority of adverse event with drug0 occur within the #ord# month , and be predictable and manageable without therapy interruption . 
suppression by drug0 of drug0 -enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinoma induce by drug0 in wistar rat . 
background : the effect of combined administration of drug0 and drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , a drug0 , on the incidence of peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinoma induce by drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- and the labeling index of intestinal cancer be investigate in male wistar rat . 
method : from the beginning of the experiment , rat be give 0 weekly subcutaneous injection of drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg body weight -rrb- and subcutaneous injection of drug0 -lrb- 0 microg/kg body weight -rrb- every other day , and from week 0 , intraperitoneal injection of drug0 -lrb- 0 or 0 mg/kg body weight -rrb- every other day until the end fo the experiment in week 0 . 
result : drug0 significantly increase the incidence of intestinal tumor and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum . 
although drug0 administer at either dose have little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by drug0 or on the location , histologic type , depth of involvement , labeling index , apoptotic index or tumor vascularity of intestinal cancer , it significantly decrease the incidence of cancer metastasis . 
drug0 also significantly decrease the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinomas , which be enhance by drug0 . 
conclusion : these finding indicate that drug0 inhibit cancer metastasis through action that do not affect the growth of intestinal cancer . 
-lsb-dose-time effect of competitive displacement of drug0 by drug0 follow oral and intravenous administration -rsb- the effect of various dose of drug0 in several dose fraction on the extent and the time scale of displacement of drug0 , in dependence on application mode , be study . 
an intravenous dose of 0 mg drug0 be in respect of competitive suppression of organ actively concentrate drug0 as effective as intravenous 0 mg clo-0- simultaneously or 0 mg orally 0 min before the injection of drug0 . 
an intravenous injection of drug0 give later also produce a complete and immediately begin depletion of drug0 already accumulate in the thyroid , within a period of 0 min after 0m-tco-0-injection with a corresponding increase in blood level . 
0 mg result in incomplete depletion which become complete after a #ord# additional dose . 
the intravenous application of drug0 offer advantages in clinical use . 
combination of drug0 and drug0 : effect on drug discrimination and behavioral inhibition in rat . 
drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- produce psychotomimetic effect in human that resemble schizophrenia symptom . 
in an effort to screen compound for antipsychotic activity , preclinical researcher have investigate whether these compound block drug0 -induced behavior in animal . 
in the present study , the drug0 drug0 be test in combination with an active dose of drug0 in two-lever drug discrimination and mixed signalled-unsignalled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rates -lrb- drl -rrb- procedure . 
drug0 produce distinctive effect in each task : it substitute for the training dose in drug0 discrimination and it increase the number of response with short -lrb- &lt ; 0 s -rrb- interresponse time as well as increase overall response rate in the drl schedule . 
acute dosing with drug0 fail to alter the behavioral effect of drug0 in either procedure even when test up to dose that produce pharmacological effect alone . 
these result suggest that acute dosing with drug0 would not affect behavior most closely associate with drug0 intoxication . 
far , they bring into question the utility of use drug0 combination procedure in animal to screen for antipsychotic potential . 
since chronic dosing be require for therapeutic efficacy of drug0 , future study should focus on investigation of chronic dosing effect of these drug in combination with drug0 . 
-lsb-multiple occupational exposure to solvent -rsb- this article review paper publish over the last 0 year on multiple occupational exposure to solvent . 
at low-levels of exposure the toxicokinetic interference between solvent have generally not be observe in man and presumably a threshold limit exist . 
conversely , at exposure level close to the &quot ; limit values&quot ; 
metabolic interference have sometimes be observe and the behaviour of the biological indicator differ from what would be expect . 
toxicodynamic interference between solvent can give rise to additive , potentiation , synergistic , antagonistic effect . 
for the identification of &quot ; limit values&quot ; , it have generally be suggest in the literature that the possible effect derive from multiple exposure be consider as additive . 
however , numerous potentiation effect have frequently be report for combined exposure to substance of widespread use . 
in this paper list of multiple exposure in which the dose of the substance , the type of interference and the behaviour of the biological level have be draw up and propose as a tool for easy consultation . 
drug0 and drug0 exert additive ocular and renal vasodilator effect on healthy human . 
aims/hypothesis : there be evidence that drug0 and drug0 cause renal and ocular vasodilation . 
there be , however , currently no datum on the effect of combined hyperglycaemia and hyper drug0 aemia on the renal and ocular blood flow see in diabetic patient on insulin therapy . 
method : we carry out #crd# different 0-way crossover study in healthy subject -lrb- each , n = 0 -rrb- . 
in study #crd# , hyperglycaemic clamp -lrb- 0 mmol/l , 0 mmol/ 0 , 0 mmol/l -rrb- be carry out during placebo or drug0 -lrb- dose 0 : 0 mu/kg/min ; dose 0 : 0 mu/kg/min -rrb- infusion . 
the #ord# study be identical but endogenous insulin secretion be block with drug0 . 
the renal plasma flow , glomerular filtration rate and pulsatile choroidal blood flow be measure use the paraaminohippurate method , the inulin method and a laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude , respectively . 
result : drug0 increase renal plasma flow and fundus pulsation amplitude but not the glomerular filtration rate . 
hyperglycaemia increase all the renal and ocular parameter study . 
haemodynamic effect of drug0 and drug0 be additive when drug0 be co-administered but not under basal condition . 
conclusions/interpretation : drug0 and drug0 can exert additive vasodilator property on renal and ocular circulation . 
to find out whether this observation be related to the increase regional perfusion in diabetes longitudinal study on patient with type i -lrb- insulin-dependent -rrb- diabetes mellitus be need . 
interaction between drug0 and antidiuretic hormone and its effect on the milk secretion by alveolus of the mammary gland of lactating rat . 
interaction between exogenous and endogenous drug0 and vasopressin be find to affect the mechanism of milk ejection by the alveolus of the mammary gland in lactating rat . 
inhibition and stimulation of the effect of drug0 on milk ejection by vasopressin be demonstrate . 
on the basis of the principle observe the concentration fo these hormone be investigate in the plasma of dog deprive of water for 0 day and then allow to drink . 
-lsb-quantitative approach to treatment with incisive drug0 by therapeutic monitoring -rsb- ; the problem encounter during the longterm treatment of psychotic patient with drug0 be illustrate by #crd# typical case report . 
a group of patient who have have a new acute episode despite seemingly adequate treatment be select . 
in these #crd# case it be demonstrate that the drug0 dosage be inappropriate , be either too high or too low as judge from the plasma concentration .
