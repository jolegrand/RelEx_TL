the effect of concomitant drug1 administration on the steady-state pharmacokinetic of drug2 . 
drug1 -lrb- ' drug2 ' -rrb- be a newly introduce drug3 with demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
it be extensively metabolize , predominantly by cytochrome p450 3a4 . 
therefore , concurrent administration of drug that induce or inhibit this enzyme may affect drug1 pharmacokinetic . 
this study demonstrate that the potent cytochrome p450 enzyme-inducer drug1 do indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of drug2 , result in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administer concomitantly to patient with dsm-iv-diagnosed schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , or bipolar disorder . 
these result indicate that dosage adjustment of drug1 may be necessary when the two drug be give concurrently and that caution may be require when administer other drug that inhibit or induce cytochrome , particularly p450 3a4 . 
-lsb- drug treatment of erection disorder in patient with cardiovascular disease -rsb- erectile dysfunction be a frequent condition in cardiovascular patient . 
since the arrival of oral drug1 , patient want to know how safe sexual activity be in cardiovascular disease in general and during use of drug2 in particular . 
sexual intercourse with a steady partner cause no more cardiovascular risk than normal daily activity such as ironing , 2 kilometer of walk without climb , paperhanging , play golf or gardening . 
the relative risk of myocardial infarction during sexual activity be not significantly higher than for healthy person . 
the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality be not higher among user of drug1 . 
drug1 be contraindicate in patient use drug2 or who may need to use drug3 , because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure . 
no interaction have be observe with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 and drug5 . 
before prescribe a symptomatic -lrb- pharmaceutical -rrb- treatment for patient with a erection disorder , attention should be give tot the sexological , psychological and medical background of the disorder . 
secondary prevention of atherosclerotic risk factor be also important : regulation of blood pressure and blood sugar level , hyperlipidaemia and obesity , as well as a change of lifestyle -lrb- give up smoking , adapting of diet and more physical exertion -rrb- . 
patient with a very low cardiac capacity should be advise to refrain from treatment of the erection disorder . 
failure of drug1 to modify drug2 induce hypertension in sheep . 
study in rat have show that drug1 administration attenuate certain type of drug2 dependent hypertension , include drug3 hypertension . 
the effect of oral drug1 on drug2 induce hypertension be examine in conscious sheep . 
drug1 have no effect on the blood pressure or metabolic response to drug2 in sheep . 
pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 in healthy male . 
the objective of this study be to determine if there be a pharmacokinetic interaction when drug1 be give with drug2 or drug3 and to determine the effect of these drug on the erythromycin breath test -lrb- ermbt -rrb- . 
twenty-four healthy male subject be randomize to one of two cohort . 
all subject receive drug1 -lrb- 1,200 mg twice a day -rrb- for 4 day , follow by a 7-day washout period , follow by either drug2 -lrb- 300 mg once a day -lsb- qd -rsb- -rrb- -lrb- cohort 1 -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- 600 mg qd -rrb- -lrb- cohort 2 -rrb- for 14 day . 
cohort 1 then receive drug1 plus drug2 for 10 day , and cohort 2 receive drug3 plus drug4 for 4 day . 
serial plasma and urine sample for measurement of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 and they drug4 , be measure by high-performance liquid chromatography . 
drug1 do not significantly affect drug2 's pharmacokinetic . 
drug1 significantly increase the area under the curve at steady state -lrb- auc -lrb- ss -rrb- -rrb- of drug2 by 2.93-fold and the auc -lrb- ss -rrb- of drug3 by 13.3-fold . 
drug1 significantly decrease the auc -lrb- ss -rrb- of drug2 by 82 % , but drug3 have no effect on drug4 pharmacokinetic . 
drug1 decrease the result of the ermbt by 83 % . 
the result of the ERMBT after 2 week of drug1 and drug2 therapy be increase 187 and 156 % , respectively . 
drug1 plus drug2 be well tolerate . 
drug1 plus drug2 be poorly tolerate , and 5 of 11 subject discontinued therapy . 
drug1 markedly increase the metabolic clearance of drug2 , and coadministration be contraindicate . 
drug1 significantly decrease clearance of drug2 and drug3 , and the combination be poorly tolerate . 
drug1 inhibit the ERMBT , and drug2 and drug3 be equipotent inducer of the ERMBT . 
-lsb- the effect of drug1 on the activity of mixed-function mono-oxidase in the liver microsome -rsb- the effect of the drug2 -- the drug drug3 -- on hepatic microsomal monooxygenase activity be study . 
the agent be find to produce some inhibiting activity against hepatic microsomal 7-ethoxycoumarine deethylase in male Wistar rat in vitro and in vivo experiment . 
when give in a dose of 50 mg/kg , drug1 produce no statistically significant effect on the duration of hexanal-induced sleep in mouse . 
the finding suggest that the agent have slight effect on the test activity . 
repeat oral administration of drug1 in sheep : interaction of drug2 with drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
interaction between treatment with drug1 , drug2 -lrb- a drug3 -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- a drug5 -rrb- , and drug6 -lrb- a inducer of microsomal enzyme -rrb- be investigate in sheep . 
a daily dose of 2 mg of drug1 / kg of body weight for 6 day do not affect the plasma enzyme or the antiprothrombinemic effect of drug2 in wether . 
the treatment of ewe with a intravenous -lrb- iv -rrb- injection of drug1 , insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase -lrb- ache -rrb- activity , appear to produce additive effect with those produce by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of drug2 / kg/day . 
in ewe give 40 mg of drug1 / kg for 5 day intraperitoneally -lrb- IP -rrb- , the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of drug2 / kg be significantly reduce and sign of toxicity be not present . 
treatment with daily dose of 2 mg of drug1 / kg for 6 day do not modify the anticholinesterase effect of a 2nd series of treatment give 6 week later . 
pharmacokinetic profile of drug1 in special population . 
the pharmacokinetic of drug1 in healthy normal volunteer have be extensively study and be well describe . 
drug1 be characterise by a high oral bioavailability , low clearance , a small volume of distribution , and a 7-hour half-life . 
it be essentially completely metabolise , therefore little be excrete unchanged . 
drug1 be highly protein bind . 
to investigate the effect of disease state or concomitant drug administration on a patient 's response to drug1 , additional pharmacokinetic study be carry out in special population . 
since drug1 have a well-defined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship , measurement of pharmacokinetic parameter be clinically relevant . 
datum from study to date show that disease state , underlie condition , and concomitantly administer highly protein-bound drug have essentially no effect on drug1 pharmacokinetic . 
therefore , drug1 can generally be give without the need for dosage modification in special population such as uncompromised elderly patient , those with moderate renal impairment , and patient with stable hepatic disease . 
enhance drug1 clearance secondary to drug2 therapy . 
this report describe two case in which drug1 clearance accelerate markedly with concomitant drug2 administration . 
Maximum calculate drug1 clearance range from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 time baseline . 
onset of the interaction begin within five day of begin concurrent therapy . 
with combine use , clinician should be aware , when drug1 be add , of the potential for reexacerbation of pulmonary symptomatology due to lowered serum drug2 concentration . 
in vitro activity of drug1 , either singly or in combination with drug2 , against mycobacterium ulceran . 
the antimicrobial effect of a drug1 , drug2 , either alone or in combination with drug3 , be evaluate in vitro against two type strain and six clinical isolate of mycobacterium ulceran . 
growth of m. 
ulceran be measure by plate count and the bactec radiometric method . 
the minimal inhibitory concentration as well as minimal bactericidal concentration of drug1 against m. 
ulceran be between 0.012 and 0.025 mg/l , while correspond value for drug1 and drug2 be in the range of 0.1-0 .8 mg/l and 0.1-0 .4 mg/l respectively . 
when combine with drug1 , drug2 exhibit strong synergistic activity while only additive effect be observe with the combination of drug3 -lrb- or drug4 -rrb- and drug5 . 
these result suggest that drug1 have a great potential in the treatment of m. 
ulcerans infection . 
pharmacokinetic of drug1 . 
effective use of drug in therapy depend not only on clinical acumen but also on the availability of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic datum . 
such information assist in development of safe dosing regimen , prediction of abnormal handling of drug in state of disease and disorder and anticipation of drug interaction . 
for the drug1 now available in the United States -lrb- drug2 , drug3 and drug4 -rrb- , these datum appear well after clinical pattern of use evolve . 
nonetheless , they relevance continue to be demonstrate by the dependence of each agent on intact liver blood flow and function for normal rate of elimination ; 
by the nonlinear kinetic characteristic for drug1 and drug2 -lrb- and probably for drug3 , as well -rrb- and the derivative implication for decrease dosing frequency requirement ; 
and by observation now appear on the relation between plasma drug level and drug effect , both therapeutic and toxic . 
such datum be discuss herein , with emphasis on those aspect that impact on the clinical use of the drug1 . 
herbal remedy , nephropathy , and renal disease . 
the use of herbal remedy be become increasingly popular in the United States . 
Research have show that herbal remedy use may be associate with acute renal failure . 
in addition , the use of herbal remedy may be detrimental for the patient with compromise renal function . 
patient with renal insufficiency or renal failure may be at risk for further kidney damage as well as complication relate to interaction of herbal remedy with complex renal therapy regimen . 
this article will describe the escalate use of herbal therapy and the hazard of herbal remedy use among patient . 
drug1 and they complication . 
drug that suppress the immune system be widely use . 
they be part of the treatment of patient with organ transplant , malignancy , and increasingly those with condition such as psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , and liver and bowel disease in which inflammation be a aetiological factor . 
because of the broaden indication for drug1 , and the prolonged survival in condition for which they be be use , many patient on immunosuppression be now care for in the community or see in non-specialist hospital , usually in close collaboration with a specialist . 
this article look at five commonly use drug1 in turn -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- , discuss the main , non-infection , unwanted effect , way to avoid they and what to do if problem arise . 
the management of infection be deal with as a separate section . 
drug1 and drug2 similarly inhibit and stimulate drug3 - or drug4 - induce proliferation of prostatic epithelium . 
prostatic epithelium proliferate in a define medium consist of basal medium rpmi1640 contain drug1 -lrb- 1 microgram/ml -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 10 ng/ml -rrb- , and drug3 -lrb- 3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 iu/ml -rrb- . 
although neither drug1 nor drug2 affect the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in rpmi1640 contain drug3 alone , they modify the mitogenic effect of drug4 and drug5 . 
drug1 at 10 -lrb- -10 -rrb- m or drug2 at about 3 x 10 -lrb- -9 -rrb- m inhibit proliferation stimulate by drug3 . 
higher concentration of drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -8 -rrb- - 10 -lrb- -6 -rrb- m -rrb- or drug2 -lrb- 3 x 10 -lrb- -8 -rrb- - 10 -lrb- -7 -rrb- m -rrb- enhance the mitogenic activity of drug3 . 
drug1 have a similar effect in the presence of drug2 . 
however , drug1 stimulate , but do not significantly inhibit , proliferation in the presence of drug2 . 
these result suggest that both drug1 and drug2 , and possibly other drug3 and drug4 , may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of drug5 and drug6 . 
death in drug1 user : cause and rate . 
the world medical literature contain 43 report of death associate with drug1 in a 35-year period . 
these include seven cerebrovascular accident , six sudden cardiac death , three case of hyperpyrexia , eight poisoning of uncertain mechanism and seven case of medical complication of intravenous injection ; 
the remainder be of uncertain cause . 
in contrast , in Ontario alone , in 1972 and 1973 there be 26 death in drug1 user , of which 16 be due to accident suicide or homicide . 
of the remain case , two be cardiac , two hepatic and the rest be mixed drug overdose . 
pulmonary granulomata , subacute hepatitis and other lesion result from intravenous drug use be common finding at autopsy . 
on the basis of the estimate number of regular user of intravenous drug1 in Ontario , the mortality rate in such user be at least four time as high as in the general population of the same age , and be comparable to that in alcoholic and drug2 addict . 
however , the absolute number of drug1 - related death be far greater than the number of death in drug2 or drug3 user . 
-lsb- a pharmacological analysis of the effect of drug1 on stimulate gastric secretion -rsb- chronic experiment on dog with gastric fistula be carry out to study the influence of drug2 and drug3 on drug4 - and drug5 - induce gastric acid secretion . 
it be establish that both angiotensin inhibit gastric acid secretion stimulate by drug1 but not by drug2 . 
comparative analysis of the effect of stimulation and inhibition of cholino - and adrenoreceptor on this inhibitory action of drug1 suggest the mediation of drug2 influence through the modulation of cholinergic reaction of parietal cell in the stomach . 
-lsb- stimulation by drug1 -- a analog of the octapeptide cholecystokinin -- of drug2 binding after the long-term administration of drug3 -rsb- it have be establish in experiment on white male rat that prolong administration -lrb- twice a day for 14 day -rrb- of drug4 -lrb- 0.25 mg/kg -rrb- and drug5 -lrb- 0.25 mg/kg -rrb- result in the reduce interaction between drug6 and low affinity binding site for drug7 in subcortical structure , whereas drug8 binding with high affinity binding site for drug9 increase both in the frontal cortex and subcortical structure of the forebrain . 
after prolonged administration of drug1 the displace effect of drug2 , a analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide , be replace by the stimulant action on drug3 binding . 
it be assume that increase interaction between drug1 and high affinity binding site for drug2 on dopamine2 - and serotonin2-receptor underlie the antipsychotic action of drug3 after they prolonged administration . 
cholecystokinin octapeptide be a necessary factor for realization of this action of drug1 . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in rat . 
the interaction of intramuscularly inject drug1 and its n-demethylated metabolite -lrb- metabolite i -rrb- with drug2 be evaluate in rat . 
five , 10 , 20 , or 50 mg/kg of drug1 alone or 20 , 50 , or 100 mg/kg of metabolite i alone produce less than 10 minute of hypnosis . 
however , drug1 anesthetic requirement -lrb- i.e. , MAC -rrb- be depress in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56 % 1-2 hour and as much as 14 % 5-6 hour after injection of drug2 , 50 mg/kg , im . 
the reduction in MAC be correlate with brain level of drug1 or metabolite I , suggest a drug2 : metabolite I potency ration of 3:1 . 
the half-life of drug1 in plasma and brain be longer in the presence of drug2 than when drug3 be give alone . 
it be conclude that drug1 be not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with drug2 would be expect to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system . 
in vitro interaction of drug1 and drug2 in placental vessel . 
the interaction of drug1 and synthetic drug2 on placental vessel be study in vitro . 
resistance be measure near the placental margin after spontaneous term delivery . 
in seven experiment reaction to drug1 and drug2 be drug3 . 
drug1 produce significantly increase vasoconstriction after a single administration of drug2 . 
in eight experiment the perfusion medium contain drug1 . 
there be no change after a single dose of drug1 . 
the reaction after drug1 remain the same in both group of experiment . 
there be thus a enhancement effect 
there be thus a enhancement effect of drug1 upon the reaction of placental vessel to drug2 in vitro . 
note : dissolution of aerosol particle of drug1 in drug2 , a model drug3 . 
the effect of a drug1 extract from bovine lung , drug2 , on the dissolution rate of aerosol particle of drug3 be determine . 
Aerosol particle of drug1 be generate from a drug2 solution , dry , and collect by a cascade impactor for characterization or by a liquid impinger for dissolution experiment . 
Powder x-ray diffraction , differential scanning calorimetry , differential thermal analysis , and scanning electron microscopy be use to characterize the aerosol particle and start material . 
no change in phase be detect , although the aerosol particle appear to contain residual drug1 . 
the dissolution rate of the aerosol particle in saline be low and variable . 
drug1 increase the extent of dissolution of drug2 in proportion to the add concentration , which be also verify by equilibrium solubilization study . 
drug1 also increase rate of dissolution , in a manner similar to drug2 . 
analysis of the concentration of drug1 follow ultracentrifugation indicate that there be rapid equilibration of drug2 between the drug3 and aqueous phase . 
these result show that drug1 have the potential of enhance the rate and extent of dissolution of drug administer to the lung . 
Anaesthesia and the epileptic pateint . 
a review . 
a review be present of some of the problem that may arise in association with anaesthesia for epileptic patient . 
there be the possibility of precipitate anticonvulsant drug toxicity . 
numerous drug interaction be possible with some drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , which affect hepatic microsomal enzyme system . 
there be the risk of convulsion occur in susceptible patient follow the use of the new drug1 which be capable of induce cns excitability . 
interaction between drug1 and drug2 in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryo . 
in this study we investigate whether also drug1 fulfil the function as co-activator in glutamatergic activation of nmda receptor in the neuronal apparatus of spontaneous motility in chick embryo . 
the successive application of drug1 -lrb- 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight -lrb- e.w. -rrb- 
and drug1 -lrb- 15 mg/kg e.w. -rrb- 
the successive application of drug1 -lrb- 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight -lrb- e.w. -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- 15 mg/kg e.w. -rrb- in a 10 min interval significantly increase the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryo in comparison with the effect of drug3 alone . 
this effect do not depend on the order of application of the drug . 
in 13-day-old embryo , drug1 be ineffective in both dose . 
it be conclude from these result that the modulatory effect of drug1 be evidently a later developmental acquisition -lrb- after day 15 of incubation -rrb- in the embryogenesis of nmda-ergic activation of spontaneous motility in chick embryo similarly as glycinergic inhibition . 
acute effect of different drug1 on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
Diabetic patient have a 20 % higher risk of depression than the general population . 
treatment with drug1 can directly interfere with blood glucose level or may interact with drug2 . 
the treatment of depression in diabetic patient must take into account variation of glycemic level at different time and a comparison of the available drug1 be important . 
in the present study we evaluate the interference of drug1 with blood glucose level of diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
in a first experiment , male adult Wistar rat be fast for 12 h. 
drug1 -lrb- 5 mg/kg -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 30 mg/kg -rrb- , drug3 -lrb- 0.25 mg/kg -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- 20 mg/kg -rrb- drug5 -lrb- 30 mg/kg -rrb- or vehicle be administer . 
after 30 min , fast glycemia be measure . 
a oral drug1 overload of 1 ml of a 50 % drug2 solution be give to rat and blood glucose be determine after 30 , 60 and 90 min . 
drug1 and drug2 do not change fasting or overload glycemia . 
drug1 and drug2 increase blood drug3 at different time after the glucose overload . 
drug1 neutralize the increase of glycemia induce by oral drug2 overload . 
in the second experiment , non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat be fast , and the same procedure be follow for estimation of drug1 tolerance 30 min after drug2 overload . 
again , drug1 neutralize the increase in glycemia after drug2 overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
these datum raise the question of whether drug1 be the best choice for prolonged use for diabetic individual , because of its antihyperglycemic effect . 
drug1 would be useful in case with potential risk of hypoglycemia . 
drug1 promote the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the microsomal fraction of rat liver and it enhance the effect of oleate in this respect . 
drug1 -lrb- 0.5-2 mm -rrb- promote the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction in a cell-free system derive from rat liver . 
by contrast , drug1 -lrb- 1 mm -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- 1 mm -rrb- have no significant effect on the translocation when add alone . 
drug1 , and to a lesser extent , drug2 , enhance the translocating action of oleate and increase its effectiveness in transfer the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction . 
it be propose that the phosphohydrolase become metabolically active when it combine with membrane and that polyamine might help to regulate this interaction . 
this could facilitate the action of fatty acid and enable cell to increase they capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis to match a increase availability of fatty acid . 
the effect of drug1 and of drug2 anesthesia on drug3 tolerance in dog . 
in a comparison of drug1 tolerance in dog anesthetized with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 , the dosage of drug5 need to cause ventricular tachycardia be significantly higher , as be the ld50 of drug6 , with drug7 or drug8 than with drug9 . 
ventricular tachycardia induce by drug1 be generally convert to sinus rhythm follow administration of drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 but not after administration of drug5 alone or after drug6 . 
excretion of thioether in urine after exposure to electrophilic chemical . 
electrophilic agent -- a class of chemical that include most genotoxic compound -- can be inactivate by reaction with glutathione or other sh-bearing molecule . 
the conjugate so form often appear in the urine as mercapturic acid or other thioether product . 
this paper critically review the suitability of the urinary thioether assay as a method for the detection of exposure to electrophilic agent or they precursor . 
in practice , the greatest value of the thioether assay appear to lie in its signal function . 
this be demonstrate for cigarette smoker and industrial worker involve in chemical waste incineration . 
Whenever increase thioether excretion be observe , it be likely to be due to exposure to one or more suspect compound . 
however , when the thioether concentration range within the limit of the normal value , one must not conclude that there be no , or negligible , exposure . 
more specific application of the assay of thio compound in urine allow development of selective method that may be useful for biological monitoring . 
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to a drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
objective : to report a case of rhabdomyolysis result from concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 . 
case summary : a 64-year-old african-american man be admit to the hospital for worsen renal failure , elevated creatine phosphokinase , diffuse muscle pain , and severe muscle weakness . 
about three week prior to admission , the patient be start on drug1 for sinusitis . 
the patient have be receive drug1 for approximately six month . 
he be treat aggressively with intravenous hydration , drug1 , and hemodialysis . 
a muscle biopsy reveal necrotizing myopathy secondary to a toxin . 
the patient continue to receive intermittent hemodialysis until he death from infectious complication that occur three month after admission . 
there be several factor that could have increase he risk for develop rhabdomyolysis , include chronic renal failure . 
discussion : drug1 be a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 , the major enzyme responsible for drug2 metabolism . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and other drug2 have result in previous report of rhabdomyolysis . 
other factor may increase the risk of this drug interaction , include the administration of other medication that be associate with myopathy , underlie renal insufficiency , and administration of high dose of drug1 . 
conclusion : drug1 inhibit the metabolism of drug2 that be metabolize by cyp3a4 -lrb- i.e. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- . 
this interaction may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis , particularly in patient with renal insufficiency or those who be concurrently take medication associate with myopathy . 
optimal design for the individual and joint exposure general logistic regression model . 
interest in administer compound in combination lie both in enhance efficacious effect and in limit adverse effect . 
although much statistical work have focus on develop mathematical function to model the joint dose-response curve , relatively little work exist in regard to design experiment for assess joint action . 
a variety of parametric dose-response model base on either the normal or logistic probability distribution have be propose in the literature . 
these model be typically nonlinear in the parameter , and as such , a nonlinear weighted least square approach can be employ for the purpose of design experiment . 
the approach be applicable across a wide variety of setting commonly associate with joint action datum , include continuous and discrete response , alternative error structure , and nonzero background response . 
further , design can be express in term of proportionate response associate with the individual compound rather than dose level , thereby provide for result that be applicable across compound . 
as a precursor to this effort , optimal and minimal experimental design for the case in which a single compound be administer have also be develop . 
although the propose methodology for derive experimental design can be apply to any nonlinear regression model , primary focus be give to the additive and nonadditive independent joint action -lrb- ija -rrb- model for individual and combined exposure propose by Barton , Braunberg , and Friedman -lrb- 1 -rrb- . 
-lsb- the gaba-ergic system and brain edema -rsb- it have be show in rat with experimental toxic and traumatic edema that drug1 -lrb- 1 mg/kg -rrb- remove the antiedematous action of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 and reduce the action of drug6 . 
when the dose of drug1 be minimize to 0.5 mg/kg such a effect be not observe . 
prolonged daily administration of drug1 in a dose of 1 mg/kg result in the development of brain edema . 
it be recommend that gaba-positive drug be include into a complex of treatment measure for edema . 
New oral therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus : the drug1 or insulin sensitizer . 
type 2 diabetes mellitus be a grow problem not only in the United States but also across the world . 
there be now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complication of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy . 
ultimately however , up to 80 % of type 2 diabetic die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease . 
this increase incidence of atherosclerotic disease be intricately associate with insulin resistance , which be a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 2 diabetes . 
there be strong evidence that insulin resistance be involve in the development of not only hyperglycemia , but also dyslipidemia , hypertension , hypercoagulation , vasculopathy , and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . 
this cluster of metabolic abnormality have be term the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
the drug1 -lrb- drug2 and drug3 -rrb- , a new class of oral drug4 , be `` insulin sensitizer '' 
and exert direct effect on the mechanism of insulin resistance . 
these effect not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduce insulin requirement , but also have potentially favorable effect on other component of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
long-term study be need to determine whether the insulin-sensitizing effect of the drug1 can prevent or delay premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , morbidity , and death . 
effect of drug1 on the apparent volume of distribution and elimination of drug2 . 
accord to Gibaldi et al. . 
-lrb- 1968 , 1970 -rrb- , the higher serum concentration of drug1 and drug2 reach after administration of drug3 be due not only to slower renal elimination but also to a altered distribution in the body . 
to determine whether drug1 have a direct effect on the distribution of drug2 , the elimination and distribution of drug3 be study in six patient , five lack kidney function and one with a partially impaired renal function , in the presence or absence of drug4 . 
no significant difference be find between the mean value of the volume of distribution of drug1 with and without drug2 -lrb- 13.0 and 12.6 liter , respectively -rrb- . 
thus , the hypothesis of Gibaldi et al. . 
could not be confirm for drug1 in patient lack kidney function . 
in spite of the absence of kidney function , the value of the elimination rate constant be significantly decrease in the presence of drug1 -lrb- from 0.326 to 0.263 / h -rrb- . 
this might be explain by a blockade by drug1 of the elimination of drug2 by the liver . 
stereoselective behavioral effect of drug1 in pigeon and squirrel monkey . 
the behavioral effect of the stereoisomer of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- be compare with those of drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- in pigeon and squirrel monkey respond under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio -lrb- fi fr -rrb- schedule of food presentation . 
Intermediate dose of drug1 or drug2 produce transient increase in fi respond in monkey and sustained increase in fi respond in pigeon ; 
higher dose decrease fi and fr respond in both species . 
in contrast to its enantiomer , drug1 fail to increase fi respond significantly in either species ; 
at high dose , drug1 decrease fi and fr respond . 
in monkey , drug1 be about 10 time more potent than drug2 in decrease respond , whereas in pigeon drug3 be about equipotent with drug4 . 
in both species , drug1 , but not drug2 , antagonize the rate-decreasing effect of drug3 on fi and fr respond . 
in monkey , the effect of drug1 , but not drug2 or drug3 , be antagonize by drug4 ; 
the dose of drug1 require to antagonize the effect of drug2 be more than 100 time higher than those require to antagonize the effect of drug3 . 
in pigeon , drug1 do not systematically alter the effect of drug2 , drug3 or drug4 . 
drug1 reduce or eliminate the increase in fi respond produce by intermediate dose of either drug2 or drug3 in pigeon , but do not antagonize the decrease in fi or fr respond produce by high dose of pcp or either stereoisomer of drug4 . 
the result demonstrate a high degree of stereoselectivity in the behavioral effect of drug1 . 
the levorotatory isomer have opioid-antagonist and non-opioid agonist effect in pigeon and mixed opioid agonist-antagonist effect in monkey . 
the dextrorotatory isomer , on the other hand , have effect similar to those of drug1 in both species . 
cancer in the elderly : basic science and clinical aspect . 
the incidence of cancer increase progressively with age . 
rearrangement of genome have be find to accompany cellular aging . 
these factor , in concert with age-dependent alteration in immune function and host defense , may help to explain the increase risk of malignant disease in aged person . 
the clinical presentation and natural history of neoplasia be also affect by aging . 
this conference review recent development in these area , examine the effect of drug use in the elderly and implication for management , and discuss current information on how age may influence the response of cancer to therapy . 
prescribe . 
Keys to maximize benefit while avoid adverse drug effect . 
when prescribe for older patient , some physician be overly cautious , and this strategy can result in a less than optimal treatment outcome . 
the reluctance to treat aggressively be understandable because the geriatric population be susceptible to adverse drug reaction . 
the key to maximize therapy lie in individualize it as much as possible . 
there be a number of step physician can take to ensure that they patient be not be undertreated . 
these step include regular reevaluation of dosage and plasma drug concentration , recognition and understanding of drug side effect , and avoidance of certain agent . 
close monitoring allow physician to minimize risk , maximize benefit , and get the most out of what modern medication can do to help older patient . 
determinant of cellular sensitivity to drug1 . 
it be now clear that topoisomerase activity level be a important determinant of sensitivity to topo drug . 
the regulation of topoisomerase be no doubt complex and multifaceted and be probably accomplish through redundancy at many control level . 
the mechanism -lrb- s -rrb- of altered topo i expression in certain tumor type be unknown , but may be relate to the central importance of topoisomerase in proliferate cell function -lrb- transcription , replication , etc. -rrb- , and the aberrant and chronic activation of these function as a result of specific tumorigenic alteration . 
small difference in sensitivity to chemotherapy can have a dramatic effect on cure rate , and therefore subtle cell type-specific difference may be important determinant of drug sensitivity . 
whether abnormal topoisomerase quantity and specific activity be associate with resistance or sensitivity to topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy in the clinic be now be study . 
determinant downstream of cleavable complex formation that affect the sensitivity of tumor versus normal cell to topo drug in particular and dna-damaging agent in general be little known . 
the goal of enhance selective tumor cell killing relative to the normal cell that be dose limit may be achieve either by overcome tumor cell resistance or by protect normal cell . 
both of these strategy will become more feasible as specific molecular difference between tumor and normal cell be be rapidly identify and new combination therapy that take advantage of these difference be be design and test . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in absorption and retention . 
the effect of supplementary oral drug1 and drug2 , as well as the interaction between both at the absorption site , fecal and urinary excretion as well as the retention of these trace element be determine by use four diet contain either 9 or 63 micrograms/kg of drug3 and 48 or 446 mg/kg of drug4 over a period of 19 day in a total of 24 rat . 
retention be calculate by the balance technique and by the comparative slaughter technique . 
after one day , fecal as well as urinary excretion of both element have already respond to the dietary treatment , with constant value be reach after approximately three day . 
drug1 excretion be enhance by supplementary drug2 ; 
fecal excretion , too , be increase by supplementary drug1 ; 
whereas urinary excretion be decrease in both case . 
additional drug1 significantly inhibit the absorption of drug2 in both dietary drug3 treatment . 
the lower rate of absorption in the group receive 446 mg drug1 instead of 48 mg of drug2 per kg diet result in a decrease renal excretion of drug3 . 
consequently , the effect of drug1 on the retention of drug2 be lower than on absorption . 
this suggest that interaction between the two element only take place at the site of absorption . 
because of the low dietary drug1 concentration as compare to the drug2 contents of the diet , no effect of drug3 on drug4 absorption and excretion occur . 
difference in drug1 balance be only observe between both dietary concentration , show a higher absolute but a lower relative absorption as well as retention in the group feed further drug2 . -lrb- abstract truncate at 250 word -rrb- 
-lsb- importance of pharmacogenetic -rsb- Pharmacogenetics deal with the difference in effect of drug cause by genetic variation . 
difference can occur in therapeutic effect and in adverse event . 
genetic variation in metabolism may result in high concentration of drug and a increase risk of adverse effect in slow metabolizer , which be important when use for example drug1 or chemotherapy . 
genetic variation also occur in protein interact with drug , which may change the effect of e.g. 
asthma drug and drug1 . 
the selection of drug and they dosage may be improve , and the number of adverse effect reduce by pharmacogenetic investigation . 
however , it may be important also in case of medical examination for insurance and job appointment , since some patient may turn out to need expensive drug or to be susceptible to a certain disease . 
therefore , the use of genetic datum in these instance have to be regulate . 
drug1 overdose recognize by a drug2 assay . 
altered mental status in a adolescent present a diagnostic challenge , and the clinician depend on clinical evaluation and laboratory study to determine therapy and prognosis . 
we report the case of a adolescent with altered consciousness cause by drug1 overdose with a positive drug2 level to alert clinician to the cross-reactivity of drug3 with a toxicology screen for drug4 . 
drug1 . 
treatment plan for patient take drug1 can become complicated . 
drug1 predispose a patient to bleed problem . 
many drug use in dentistry can not be take concomitantly with these medication . 
acute drug1 administration do not affect subjective response to drug2 in human . 
rationale : stress and drug1 facilitate and reinstate psychostimulant self-administration in rodent . 
however , the effect of stress and drug1 on the subjective and behavioral effect of drug2 have not be well study in human . 
objective : to examine the effect of acute drug1 pretreatment on the subjective and behavioral effect of drug2 . 
method : drug1 -lrb- 100 mg -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- 20 mg -rrb- be administer orally to 16 healthy male and female volunteer in a four-session , placebo-controlled , within-subject , crossover design . 
to prevent stomach irritation , subject receive drug1 before each experimental session . 
dependent measure include self-reported mood and subjective effect -lrb- Addiction Research Center inventory , the profile of mood state , and a series of visual analogue scale -rrb- , vital sign , salivary cortisol , and psychomotor performance . 
result : drug1 elevated salivary cortisol level , produce modest dysphoria , and reduce subject ' report of want more drug . 
however , drug1 pretreatment do not affect any of the physiological , behavioral , or subjective effect of drug2 . 
conclusion : in contrast to the effect of drug1 in rodent study , these result indicate that a acute increase in cortisol do not enhance the psychostimulant effect of drug2 in human . 
effect of drug1 on drug2 - induce change in steroid hormone level and lethality in male rat . 
we examine the effect of exogenous drug1 on the change in serum steroid hormone level induce by a nonlethal dose of escherichia coli drug2 in male rat and the death due to nonlethal and lethal dose of drug3 . 
injection of drug1 5 min before a nonlethal dose of drug2 change the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rat to drug3 . 
the serum estrogen concentration of drug1 + drug2 - treat rat decrease by 50 % , while those of the drug3 - treat rat increase -lrb- 2 - to 5-fold -rrb- . 
the serum androgen concentration of drug1 + drug2 - treat rat do not change significantly , while those of drug3 - treat rat drop to 30-40 % 
0.001 . 
exogenous drug1 also appear to influence the percentage of drug2 - induce death in a dose-dependent manner . 
it reduce the number of death induce by nonlethal -lrb- 2 mg/kg -rrb- dose of drug1 but increase the number of death induce by a highly lethal dose -lrb- 8 mg/kg -rrb- . 
these result , together with the known relationship between drug1 and the immune response , suggest that drug2 affect the course of septic shock in a complex fashion and may have either protective or deleterious effect . 
study on the mechanism of action of drug1 : effect of drug2 on respiration and cell permeability of candida albican . 
the drug1 , drug2 , inhibit the growth of several species of candida . 
candida albican , one of the pathogenic species , be totally inhibit at a concentration of approximately 10 mug/ml . 
endogenous respiration be unaffected by the drug at a concentration as high as 100 mug/ml , whereas exogenous respiration be markedly sensitive and inhibit to a extent of 85 % . 
the permeability of the cell membrane be change as evidence by the leakage of 260-nm absorb material , amino acid , protein , and inorganic cation . 
the result we present clearly show that the drug alter the cellular permeability , and thus the exogenous respiration become sensitive to the drug . 
interferon induction : tool for establish interaction among homopolyribonucleotide . 
hitherto unrecognized interaction between homopolyribonucleotide and complex thereof be suggest by interferon induction datum obtain in a highly sensitive assay system of primary rabbit kidney cell culture superinduce by metabolic inhibitor . 
drug1 : a therapeutic update . 
background : since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998 , drug1 have be use by million of man for the treatment of erectile dysfunction . 
recent study and consensus report have expand we understanding of its efficacy , safety , contraindication , and drug interaction . 
objective : this paper review recent study of the efficacy of drug1 , its adverse effect and drug interaction , and socioeconomic factor involve in its use , with a focus on specific patient population -lrb- prostate cancer , diabetes mellitus , ischemic heart disease , spinal cord injury , neurologic disorder -rrb- . 
method : clinical study , case report , and commentary and editorial concern drug1 publish in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 be identify through search of medline , premedline , and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts , use the term drug2 , drug3 , and erectile dysfunction . 
result : drug1 have demonstrate effectiveness in man with erectile dysfunction associate with prostatectomy , radiation therapy , diabetes mellitus , certain neurologic disorder , and drug therapy -lrb- eg , drug2 -lsb- drug3 -rsb- -rrb- . 
it have not be as effective in woman with sexual dysfunction , with the exception of drug1 - associate sexual dysfunction . 
some disorder unrelated to sexual dysfunction -lrb- eg , esophageal motility dysfunction -rrb- may also respond to drug1 . 
in the general population , drug1 be consider to have a acceptable tolerability profile ; 
however , patient with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those take drug1 therapy be at increase risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effect with drug2 therapy . 
in addition , patient take drug that inhibit the cytochrome p450 3a4 isozyme , which metabolize drug1 , may experience increase drug concentration and possible toxicity from normal dose of drug2 . 
conclusion : drug1 be a effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in man . 
the decision to prescribe this agent should include such consideration as the cost-risk-benefit balance , patient access , drug distribution pathway , and prescription drug coverage . 
tumor phenotype and susceptibility to progression as a expression of subpopulation of initiate murine cell . 
currently , it be conceive that a number of event , or hit , be require for the induction of tumor by chemical agent . 
the first phase of this sequence , initiation , be consider to result from at least one event in the genetic apparatus . 
analysis of this sequence , however , usually give little consideration to the nature of the target cell or to the characteristic of the resultant tumor . 
Vesselinovitch et al. . 
-lrb- cancer res. , 38 : 2003-2010 , 1978 -rrb- have report that a single , small pulse of carcinogen can induce early and numerous liver tumor when administer neonatally to mouse with a genetic predisposition to hepatotumorigenesis . 
in the current study , the nonpredisposed strain c57bl/6n be also show to be highly susceptible to diethylnitrosamine during the neonatal period . 
c57bl/6n demonstrate large number of two of the three type of liver tumor see in liver of genetically predispose mouse , one of which require the additional stimulus of dietary drug1 for growth . 
tumor of more malignant phenotype be demonstrate only in genetically predispose mouse -lrb- c57bl/6n x c3h/hen f1 -rrb- that receive one dose of carcinogen . 
these finding suggest that the phenotype of a tumor that result from a pulse of a chemical carcinogen may depend upon the target cell . 
the initiate cell that result from this hit may vary from those that demonstrate very little progression in cell type and may or may not require exogenous enhancement of growth to those that can progress very rapidly to fully malignant behavior . 
the latter might arise from a hit in a genetically initiate cell , the result of which be a more rapid progression in tumor type . 
effect of drug1 upon the metabolism of chylomicron-like emulsion in patient with coronary artery disease . 
slow chylomicron intravascular catabolism have be associate with coronary artery disease and screening for drug that can speed-up this process can be important . 
in this study , the effect of drug1 upon chylomicron metabolism be test by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 12 patient with coronary artery disease , aged 59 + / -11 year , -lrb- total cholesterol : 240 + / -41 mg/dl ; triglyceride : 188 + / -42 mg/dl -rrb- submit to a randomize , crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled study with administration of 1 g per day drug2 or placebo for 1-month . 
a 1-month washout period be insert between the treatment period . 
patient be intravenously inject a chylomicron-like emulsion doubly label with 14c-cholesteryl oleate and 3h-triolein at baseline and after treatment . 
after drug1 treatment , there be decrease of total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma level and a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma level . 
drug1 elicit 62 % enhancement of post - drug2 lipolytic activity and 100 % increase of 3h-triglyceride fractional clearance rate compare with placebo treatment . 
14c-cholesterol ester fractional clearance rate be 260 % greater after drug1 than after placebo . 
therefore , a potent effect of drug1 on both chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal be achieve , indicate that this drug can be use to improve this metabolism in future prospective study . 
selective survival in drug1 and drug2 of pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype o11 from drug addict . 
the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa , particularly serotype o11 , in drug1 and drug2 
be evaluate as a possible explanation for the association of deep-seated infection with this organism and abuse of these drug . 
the mean reduction of growth cause by the drug be 1,000-fold greater for 49 pseudomonas strain from normal subject than for 32 strain from drug addict -lrb- 4.2 vs. 1.3 log of reduction at 2 hr , p less than .0005 -rrb- . 
a common phenotypic subset of the serotype o11 strain from drug addict be especially resistant to the inhibitory effect . 
twelve strain of staphylococcus aureus -lrb- a frequent cause of infection in drug1 , but not in drug2 and drug3 , addict -rrb- be completely inhibit by the drug combination . 
dose-response curve -lrb- derive from the result of use the tablet as well as pure powder -rrb- show that drug1 be responsible for the inhibitory activity , which be partially antagonize by drug2 . 
we conclude that a ability of some p. 
aeruginosa serotype o11 strain , but not S. 
aureus , to survive in drug1 and drug2 may explain in part a shift from S. 
aureus to P. 
aeruginosa as common pathogen of drug addict in area where abuse of this combination of drug have increase . 
influence of coadministration of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetic and qtc interval in healthy volunteer . 
study objective : to evaluate the effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetic and cardiovascular safety of drug2 at steady state in healthy man . 
design : open-label , three-phase , sequential study . 
SETTING : clinical research center . 
subject : twelve healthy male volunteer . 
intervention : each subject be treat accord to the following sequence : baseline ; 
phase 1 -lrb- day 1-6 -rrb- : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ; 
washout -lrb- day 7-13 -rrb- ; 
phase 2 -lrb- day 14-44 -rrb- : drug1 20 mg/day ; 
and phase 3 -lrb- day 45-52 -rrb- : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day -lrb- day 45-51 -rrb- plus drug2 20 mg/day -lrb- day 45-52 -rrb- . 
measurement and MAIN result : blood sample be draw and 12-lead electrocardiogram perform at specify time point after the last morning dose of drug1 in phase 1 and 3 . 
blood sample also be take before morning dose on the 3rd , 4th , and 5th day of phase 1 and 3 . 
electrocardiogram be do at baseline and on the last day of the washout period and phase 2 . 
coadministration of drug1 significantly decrease drug2 plasma concentration . 
there be no clinically significant change in correct qt interval during administration of drug1 alone or with drug2 . 
drug1 be well tolerate when administer alone or with drug2 . 
conclusion : drug1 can be administer safely to patient receive low therapeutic dosage of drug2 . 
activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 against cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture . 
the in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 be investigate . 
drug1 show moderate activity , which increase with increase concentration to 55.7 % suppression of growth at 20 microm . 
moreover , its activity be enhance when it be combine with either drug1 or drug2 with 90 % parasite reduction at the highest concentration test . 
drug1 may be active in inhibit cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either drug2 or drug3 . 
modification of surface histidine residue abolish the cytotoxic activity of drug1 . 
drug1 display both cytotoxic and enterotoxic activity . 
it have recently be demonstrate that drug1 exert its cytotoxic effect by the glucosylation of the small gtp-binding protein of the rho family . 
drug1 , at ph 7.0 , be use to chemically modify expose histidine residue on drug2 . 
modification of drug1 with drug2 abolish both its cytotoxic activity and the ability of the toxin to bind zn-sepharose gel . 
treatment of drug1 with -lsb- -lrb- 14 -rrb- c -rsb- - drug2 reveal concentration dependent labelling of histidine residue on the toxin molecule . 
the effect of drug1 could be reverse by drug2 treatment . 
these datum suggest the modify histidine residue on drug1 be critical to its cytotoxic activity . 
histidine modification have no effect on the glucosyl transferase enzyme activity of drug1 . 
however , modification abolish the ` cold ' binding of toxin to bovine thyroglobulin in a elisa and reduce ligand binding activity in a rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination assay . 
the datum suggest that the histidine residue may be crucial to the receptor-binding activity of drug1 . 
expose histidine on drug1 be available for drug2 chelation , and these have be exploit in the development of a novel purification protocol for drug3 use drug4 - chelate chromatography . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in vitro . 
the minimal inhibitory concentration of drug1 and drug2 alone and in combination be determine by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic , facultative , and anaerobic clinical isolate . 
all 77 strain of staphylococcus aureus , diplococcus pneumoniae , streptococcus pyogene , and anaerobic bacterium -lrb- except for three strain of clostridium -rrb- be inhibit by 1.6 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
drug1 do not interfere with the activity of drug2 within the range of concentration test -lrb- 0.1 to 100 mug/ml -rrb- ; 
for some strain combination be synergistic . 
sixty-two -lrb- 94 % -rrb- of 66 strain of Enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa be inhibit by 6.2 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
combination of drug1 and drug2 be indifferent for 29 strain and synergistic for 33 strain . 
all 20 strain of enterococcus , three strain of Clostridium , three strain of escherichia coli , and one strain of Proteus rettgeri be resistant to both drug1 -lrb- minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml -rrb- . 
combination of drug1 and drug2 be indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strain . 
except for drug1 - sensitive isolate , synergy be usually observe only at concentration of one or both drug which be not readily obtainable in vivo . 
antagonism be never observe . 
drug1 and the common cold . 
evaluation of its efficacy and toxicity . 
we review the clinical datum relate to the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic dose of drug1 in the prevention and treatment of the common cold . 
although one study tentatively support the hypothesis that such dose of drug1 may be efficacious , a second study by the same group do not confirm the significant finding , and no clear , reproducible pattern of efficacy have emerge from the review of all the evidence . 
similarly , there be currently little adequate evidence on either the presence or the absence of serious adverse reaction to such dose of drug1 , although many such reaction have be hypothesize . 
the unrestricted use of drug1 for these purpose can not be advocate on the basis of the evidence currently available . 
effect of drug1 in a light/dark test in mouse and the contribution of adenosine receptor . 
we investigate the effect of adenosine receptor antagonist , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -lrb- drug5 -rrb- , in a light/dark test in mouse . 
all antagonist decrease the time spend in the light zone in this test , which suggest that these compound have anxiogenic effect . 
the anxiogenic effect of drug1 be reduce by pretreatment with drug2 , a a2-selective agonist , but not by drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- , a a1-selective agonist . 
however , the antagonism of the drug1 - induce anxiogenic effect by drug2 be only observe in the time spend in the light zone , and drug3 - induce anxiogenic effect be neither reverse by drug4 nor by drug5 . 
finally , it be notable that xanthine-derived adenosine antagonist test here commonly show anxiogenic effect in the light/dark test in mouse . 
it be suggest that there be a minor contribution of adenosine receptor to these effect , although drug1 - induce anxiogenic effect be antagonize by a a2 receptor agonist . 
restoration of drug1 susceptibility in enterococcus faecalis by antiresistance determinant gene transfer . 
we assess the ability of gene transfer to reverse drug1 resistance in class a -lrb- vana -rrb- glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecalis . 
recombinant shuttle vector contain a vanh promoter-vana antisense gene cassette fully restore drug1 susceptibility through a combined transcriptional activator binding domain decoy and inducible vana antisense rna effect . 
induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cell in response to drug1 and drug2 . 
1 , drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , the active metabolite of drug3 , be a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . 
we have show that mcf-7 cell treat with 100 nm drug1 exhibit characteristic apoptotic morphology -lrb- pyknotic nucleus , chromatin and cytoplasmic condensation , nuclear matrix protein reorganization -rrb- within 48 h . 
in the experiment report here , we examine the interaction between drug1 and the drug2 drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- , which also induce apoptosis in mcf-7 cell . 
we datum suggest that drug1 significantly potentiate the reduction in cell number induce by drug2 alone . 
combined treatment with drug1 and drug2 enhance the degree of apoptosis assess use morphological marker that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation . 
we have select a subclone of mcf-7 cell resistant to drug1 -lrb- mcf-7d3re -rrb- . 
these cell express the vitamin d receptor and exhibit double time comparable to the parental mcf-7 cell , even when grow in 100 mm drug1 . 
treatment of both parental and resistant mcf-7 cell with drug1 induce apoptosis and clusterin . 
these datum emphasize that apoptosis can be induce in mcf-7 cell either by activation of drug1 - mediate signalling or disruption of drug2 - dependent signalling . 
cholinergic role in drug1 's effect on evoke potential in visual cortex of the albino rat . 
photic evoke potential be record from the visual cortex of chronically implant albino rat . 
since photic evoke potential component be representation of neural pathway which be activate during photic stimulation , study of the effect of drug1 on these component may help to trace pathway which be affect by drug2 . 
in the present study , evoke potential be record at 5 , 20 , and 40 min follow IP injection of saline , drug1 -lrb- 2.0 g/kg -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 0.6 mg/kg -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- 15.0 mg/kg -rrb- on separate day . 
drug1 depress the amplitude of most evoke potential component in comparison to saline administration . 
component p2 , however , be increase in amplitude . 
drug1 briefly reduce the amplitude of most component , include p2 . 
in contrast , drug1 increase the amplitude of component p1 and p2 , while decrease component n1 , n2 and n3 for vary duration of time . 
drug1 pretreatment augment the depressant effect of drug2 on the early component p1 and n1 , while attenuate drug3 's influence on component p2 and p3 . 
pretreatment with drug1 likewise further reduce the amplitude of component p1 and n1 , and produce a similar effect on component n3 . 
drug1 , either alone or in combination with drug2 , produce approximately the same degree of enhancement of component p2 . 
in comparison to saline value , all three agent produce reliable increase in peak latency for most of the component , with only n3 show no effect . 
the amplitude datum from this study suggest that drug1 's augmentation of component p2 may result , at least in part , from alteration in cholinergic function . 
increase hepatotoxicity of drug1 by concomitant administration of drug2 in the rat . 
since drug1 be frequently co-administer with drug2 , it be of clinical interest to study the effect of drug3 on the hepatotoxicity of drug4 . 
in male sprague-dawley rat fast for 18 h , concomitant administration of drug1 -lrb- 0.1 g/kg , i.p. -rrb- 
as judge by increase serum enzyme activity and increase incidence of hepatic necrosis . 
careful observation on hepatotoxicity be suggest when drug1 be prescribe with drug2 . 
dual effect of drug1 on the drug2 - induce contraction and norepinephrine release in the guinea-pig vas deferen . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , c129h223n3o54 , isolate from marine coelenterate of palythoa tuberculosa , cause a first rapid contraction follow by the slow phasic contraction of guinea-pig va deferen . 
in the presence of drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- m -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -8 -rrb- m -rrb- fail to cause the first contraction ; 
however , the second contraction be potentiate . 
in the presence of drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -6 -rrb- m -rrb- , the second contraction be inhibit selectively . 
when drug1 be apply to the muscle in the presence of drug2 , both first and second contractile response to drug3 be abolish . 
when the muscle be expose to the potassium-depleted solution , the first contractile response to drug1 be rather potentiated . 
drug1 cause the release of norepinephrine from the muscle . 
exposure of the muscle to drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- m -rrb- markedly increase the drug2 - induce release . 
it be indicate that the first and second contractile response to drug1 have entirely different property . 
the second response be due to a release of norepinephrine from nerve and be potentiate by drug1 through the increase in the norepinephrine release , whereas the first response be not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and be inhibit by drug2 . 
the mechanism of the action of drug1 be discuss in the relation with na,k-atpase . 
analgesic effect of drug1 . 
the literature provide considerable evidence indicate that several , but not all drug1 , be indeed drug2 and some be drug3 as well . 
those for which effectiveness be report include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
the proposed mechanism of analgesic action of drug1 be review and discuss . 
the literature suggest that more than one mechanism of action exist for they . 
there be considerable evidence suggest that histaminergic and serotoninergic central pathway be involve in nociception and that drug1 drug can modulate they response -lrb- 1 -rrb- . 
the evidence for a role for norepinephrine and dopamine and the effect of drug1 on they be less well establish . 
still other pathway have be propose . 
a greater understanding of pain mechanism will aid in elucidate the role of drug1 in analgesia . 
effect of drug1 on voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype in bovine chromaffin cell . 
in previous report we have show that drug1 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel in neuronal cell . 
however , these study do not show whether drug1 - induce inhibition of ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- current discriminate among the various ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype , although it be know that there be at least five different ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype in neuronal cell . 
in this study we investigate the effect of drug1 on high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype use they drug2 drug3 -lrb- l-type -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- n-type -rrb- , or drug5 -lrb- p-type -rrb- in bovine chromaffin cell . 
we could observe that drug1 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- current in a dose-dependent manner . 
the ic -lrb- 50 -rrb- be about 120 microgram/ml . 
drug1 have no effect on drug2 response . 
these datum suggest that drug1 be negatively couple to three type of calcium channel in bovine chromaffin cell , include a drug2 - sensitive -lrb- n-type -rrb- channel , a drug3 - sensitive -lrb- p-type -rrb- channel and drug4 / drug5 / drug6 - resistant -lrb- presumptive q-type -rrb- channel . 
thus , the selective regulation of voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- subtype by drug1 in bovine chromaffin cell could be the cellular basis of antistress effect induce by drug2 . 
a propose mechanism for the potentiation of camp-mediated acid secretion by drug1 . 
acid secretion in isolate rabbit gastric gland be monitor by the accumulation of -lsb- -lrb- 14 -rrb- c -rsb- drug1 . 
stimulation of the gland with drug1 synergistically augment the response to dibutyryl camp . 
the augmentation persist even after drug1 be wash out and be resistant to chelated extracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- and to inhibitor of either protein kinase c or calmodulin kinase ii . 
drug1 at 10 microm preferentially block the secretory effect of drug2 and its synergism with camp , whereas it have no effect on histamine - or camp-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min . 
drug1 inhibit the drug2 - stimulate intracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- concentration -lrb- -lsb- ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- -rrb- increase due to release from the ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- store . 
treatment of the gland with drug1 redistribute type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor -lrb- the major subtype in the parietal cell -rrb- from the fraction contain membrane of large size to the microsomal fraction , suggest a dissociation of the store from the plasma membrane . 
these finding suggest that intracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- release by cholinergic stimulation be critical for determine synergism with camp in parietal cell activation and that functional coupling between the ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- store and the receptor be maintain by actin microfilament . 
Phenytoin intoxication induce by drug1 . 
a patient have phenytoin intoxication after administration of drug1 , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . 
the serum concentration of drug1 increase dramatically from 16.6 to 49.1 microg/ml when drug2 be coadminister , although the daily dosage of drug3 and other drug4 have not change . 
during drug1 and fluvoxamine treatment , ataxia , a typical side effect of drug2 , be observe . 
the genotype of drug1 and 2c19 , the enzyme responsible for phenytoin metabolism , be homozygous for the wild-type allele -lrb- drug2 * 1 / * 1 and 2c19 * 1 / * 1 -rrb- . 
the interaction may be a result of inhibition of both drug1 and 2c19 by drug2 . 
pharmacokinetic evaluation of the drug1 - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 be know to raise serum drug2 level . 
this study be design to evaluate the pharmacokinetic basis of this interaction in 10 normal subject . 
the pharmacokinetic variable for drug1 be determine after a 1.0 mg intravenous dose of drug2 in each subject , before and after oral drug3 , 400 mg daily for 3 week . 
during drug1 administration , systemic clearance of drug2 be reduce from 234 + / - 72 ml/min -lrb- mean + / - standard deviation -rrb- to 172 + / - 33 ml/min -lrb- p less than 0.01 -rrb- . 
this be due to reduction in both renal clearance -lrb- from 105 + / - 39 to 84 + / - 15 ml/min -rrb- -lrb- p less than 0.05 -rrb- and nonrenal clearance -lrb- from 130 + / - 38 to 88 + / - 20 ml/min -rrb- -lrb- p less than 0.01 -rrb- . 
drug1 half-life of elimination be prolong from 34 + / - 13 to 40 + / - 16 hour -lrb- p less than 0.05 -rrb- . 
drug1 volume of distribution be not significantly change . 
drug1 cause a three - to fivefold increase in serum reverse triiodothyronine level , but change in thyroid function be not quantitatively related to the change in drug2 pharmacokinetic . 
these alteration in drug1 pharmacokinetic produce by drug2 explain the increase in serum drug3 level that have be observe when this drug combination have be use clinically . 
activation of a effector immediate-early gene arc by drug1 . 
as immediate-early gene -lrb- ieg -rrb- be think to play a critical role in mediate stimulus-induced neural plasticity , ieg response induce by drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- have be characterize to define the change in gene expression that may underlie its long-lasting behavioral effect . 
although activation of several transcription factor ieg have be describe , little be know about effector ieg . 
here , we have examine whether drug1 administration affect expression of a effector IEG arc -lrb- activity-regulated , cytoskeleton-associated -rrb- that encode a protein with homology to spectrin . 
use in situ hybridization , we observe that drug1 cause a rapid and transient dose-dependent increase in arc mrna level in the striatum and cortex that be abolish by pretreatment with the specific dopamine d1 receptor antagonist drug2 but not by a drug3 drug4 . 
drug1 induce arc mrna in layer iv and VI of the cortex which dopamine receptor be localized to . 
these result suggest that d1 receptor be couple to activation of arc gene , which may be involve in functional or structural alteration underlie neural plasticity trigger by drug1 . 
differential action of intrathecal drug1 on block the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 in rat . 
in the present study , it be propose that the drug1 apply to supraspinal brain site produce they analgesic effect by the activation of different descend pain inhibitory system . 
the blockade of the spinal endorphinergic system by intrathecal drug1 on the production of tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 be then study . 
intraventricular injection of drug1 and drug2 produce a inhibition of the tail-flick response to the heat stimulus in rat . 
intrathecal injection of drug1 at dose of 0.4 to 40 microgram cause a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induce by intraventricular injection of drug2 , and a high dose of drug3 -lrb- 40 microgram -rrb- completely block the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug4 -lrb- 16 microgram -rrb- . 
on the other hand , intrathecal drug1 -lrb- 12-120 microgram -rrb- have only a very weak effect on the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 -lrb- 40 microgram -rrb- . 
intraventricular injection of drug1 at dose of 1.2 to 12 microgram equally antagonize in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 . 
the result indicate that a spinal drug1 - sensitive endorphinergic system be involve in the production of drug2 but not drug3 - induce tail-flick inhibition , and suggest that intraventricular drug4 and drug5 elicit they pharmacological action via the activation of different descend pain inhibitory system ; 
descend epsilon and mu system for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , be propose . 
pharmacological treatment of depression : the role of drug1 . 
depression be reach epidemic proportion in the western world . 
with each successive generation more people be become more severely depress at a younger age . 
drug interaction : how to identify they . 
interaction between theraputic agent have be recognize as increasingly important cause of drug at they usual recommend dose may , under certain condition , produce toxicity of life-endangering proportion . 
while the recognition of drug toxicity result from interaction be of importance to all physciain , it be especially so for the clinician responsible for the welfare of those in the aerospace environment . 
this paper attempt to provide a basis for the understanding and identification of important drug interaction . 
guideline be provide to assist the clinician in he logical approach to the identification of drug interaction when serious drug toxicity be encounter in a pateint . 
only with knowledge of the interaction can the therapeutic regimen be alter so as to provide therapeutic level of necessary drug while avoid toxicity . 
change in urinary homocysteine follow drug1 and drug2 administration to rat . 
the present work involve the administration of both drug1 and drug2 to group of rat , follow by determination of the homocysteine excretion rate in urine . 
the result indicate that a statistically significant difference exist between the excreted level of homocysteine in the urine of both control and drug1 - treat rat and the level show by rat treat with drug2 . 
the implication of these result be discuss , especially with respect to observation which indicate that homocysteine may be a precipitate factor in the development of thrombosis . 
also include in this paper be a study which confirm the identity of the hplc peak as be homocysteine by form a radioactive derivative of this particular sulphydryl-containing amino acid , and then analyse the result mixture by tlc . 
effect of drug1 and drug2 on the antinociceptive effect of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 in mouse . 
the influence of drug1 and drug2 on antinociceptive effect of drug3 -lrb- 10 mg/kg -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- 500 mg/kg -rrb- and drug5 -lrb- 10 mg/kg -rrb- be investigate in a mouse model use the tail-flick and hot-plate test . 
all drug be inject intraperitoneally . 
drug1 be administer to mouse 30 min before apply the drug2 . 
measurement of nociception be perform within 2 h after drug1 administration . 
drug1 at dose of 0.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg inject with drug2 be find to decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug3 . 
similarly , drug1 decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug2 -lrb- only in the tail-flick test -rrb- and drug3 . 
drug1 use at dose of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug2 , drug3 -lrb- only in the tail-flick test -rrb- and drug4 . 
-lsb- the effect of drug1 on the renal excretion of drug2 and drug3 in dog -rsb- the intravenous injection of drug4 in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhance drug5 and drug6 excretion in chronic canine experiment . 
the higher drug1 and drug2 excretion be due to they increase renal tubular secretion . 
in dog , drug1 unchanged the secretion of drug2 , a test agent for anionic transport . 
possible extrarenal mechanism of action of drug1 on drug2 and drug3 transport be also examine . 
differential regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cell by drug1 , a homodimeric disintegrin , and monomeric disintegrin drug2 and drug3 . 
the homodimeric disintegrin drug1 be compare directly to the monomeric disintegrin drug2 and drug3 for the ability to affect protein tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cell . 
it be observe that drug1 have a dramatic effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of several protein in t24 human bladder cancer cell , include robust induction of phosphorylation of protein in the range of 120-140 kda . 
drug1 alone have no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in t24 cell , but dose-dependently inhibit the effect of drug2 when both be add simultaneously . 
among the protein that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to drug1 treatment be CAS , a 130 kda adapter protein involve in integrin signaling . 
drug1 alone be find to have no effect on CAS , but can completely block drug2 - induce phosphorylation of this protein in mda-mb-435 cell . 
these observation strongly suggest that the homodimeric structure of drug1 functionally distinguish it from other monomeric member of the disintegrin family . 
toxicity of cadmium and drug1 to miracidia of schistosoma mansonus . 
the specific objective of this study be to elucidate metal toxicity to hatching , survival and avoidance behaviour of schistosoma mansoni miracidia . 
the toxicity of cadmium , drug1 , and cadmium/zinc mixture at concentration range from 10000 to 10 microg/l be investigate . 
metal mixture toxicity investigation be undertake with equal concentration of the metal . 
the hatching of miracidia from egg be inhibit by concentration of 1000-10000 microg/l of single metal . 
metal mixture have no effect on drug1 hatching . 
survival of miracidia be reduce by increase metal concentration except at concentration of 10 microg/l for single metal toxicity where survival be increase above the control . 
Miracidia demonstrate a rapid avoidance behaviour when briefly expose to heavy metal . 
the mechanism of metal toxicity to miracidia be briefly discuss . 
drug-lab interaction : implication for nutrition support . 
drug1 interference with urine ketone test . 
it be important that health care professional be aware of the potential for medication to interfere with clinical laboratory test . 
medication can cause in vivo effect when the concentration or activity of the analyte be alter before the analysis and therefore the assay result be true and accurate . 
a in vitro effect occur when the medication interfere with the assay , and the result be erroneous and can not be interpret . 
this report describe a recently identify case of interference of drug1 with the urine test for ketone and demonstrate the importance of a thorough medication review in evaluate abnormal laboratory test . 
-lsb- pharmacologic interaction in chronic treatment : corrective measure for its prevention in a basic area of rural health -rsb- objective : to identify the pharmacological interaction of clinical relevance -lrb- picr -rrb- in the medication authorization card -lrb- MAC -rrb- of the chronically ill and to establish strategy to minimise they appearance . 
design : cross-sectional descriptive study . 
SETTING : Rural primary care centre . 
patient : Random sample of 626 MAC out of a total of 1306 . 
measurement and main result : in December 1998 , the following be gather for every MAC with more than one drug treatment : age , sex , number of drug , intrinsic value , drug prescribe , daily dose and pharmacological interaction -lrb- pi -rrb- , classify -lrb- use the scale of Hansten 1996 -rrb- into light and clinically relevant . 
statistical analysis : Mantel-Haenszel -lrb- alpha = 0.05 -rrb- . 
patient ' mean age be 69.1 -lrb- 95 % ci , + / - 1.2 -rrb- . 
mean number of drug per MAC be 4 -lrb- 95 % ci , + / - 0.2 -rrb- . 
341 pi affect 197 patient -lrb- 31.5 % , 95 % ci , + / - 3.6 -rrb- be identify .

neurochemical and functional consequence follow drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and drug3 . 
the neurochemical and functional consequence follow drug1 administration to the rat be evaluate and compare to similar effect follow drug2 administration . 
it be observe that drug1 induce long lasting depletion of striatal dopamine concentration and this neurotoxic effect could be prevent by drug2 pretreatment . 
the drug1 - induce neuronal damage produce a tolerance to the disruptive effect of drug2 and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effect of drug3 in rat respond in a schedule control paradigm . 
drug1 , like drug2 , produce depletion of striatal dopamine but these action be potentiate by drug3 pretreatment . 
these observation be discuss in reference to possible deleterious effect follow the administration of drug1 to patient with Parkinson 's disease . 
response to drug1 of the perfused pancreas of the genetically diabetic chinese hamster . 
Nonketotic , genetically diabetic cinese hamster show subnormal pancreatic insulin release and impaired suppression of glucagon in response to glucose . 
to study the pancreatic effect of other agent , dynamic insulin and glucagon release be measure from the in vitro perfused pancreas of normal and diabetic chinese hamster in response to various combination of drug1 -lrb- 20mm -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 100 or 150 mg . per 100 ml . -rrb- , and drug3 -lrb- 10 mm -rrb- . 
drug1 alone cause identical insulin and glucagon release in diabetic and normal . 
drug1 , alone and in the presence of drug2 , cause subnormal insulin release and less suppression of glucagon release in the diabectic than in the normal . 
drug1 , in the presence of drug2 and drug3 , cause excessive glucagon release but nearly normal insulin release in the diabetic . 
drug1 , in the absence of drug2 or drug3 , cause excessive glucagon release in the diabetic and undetectable insulin release in either diabetic or normal . 
pancreatic content after perfusion do not correlate with release during perfusion . 
infusion of drug1 alone markedly decrease the amount of extractable pancreatic insulin and glucagon . 
these result indicate that the pancreatic alpha cell of the diabetic chinese hamster respond excessively to drug1 , as be see in the human diabetic . 
this defect be not relate to acute insulin release or the presence of drug1 . 
further , these result confirm that the diabetic chinese hamster 's alpha and beta cell respond normally to drug1 , but be relatively insensitive to drug2 . 
interference of biocytin with drug1 - evoke hyperpolarization and membrane property of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neuron . 
in we laboratory , preliminary whole-cell , tight seal recording of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neuron include biocytin in the patch pipette yield a significantly smaller proportion of neuron hyperpolarize by drug1 compare with recording without biocytin . 
therefore , we investigate the effect of biocytin inclusion on drug1 response and other membrane property during whole-cell , tight seal recording of these neuron . 
the percentage of neuron hyperpolarize by drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 be significantly reduce when 1 % but not < 
or = 0.2 % biocytin be include in the recording pipette , compare with neuron record without biocytin . 
however , a significantly higher proportion of neuron fire spontaneous action potential with either 0.05-0 .2 or 1 % biocytin compare to no biocytin . 
rest membrane potential , input impedance and the proportion of neuron display transient outward rectification be each significantly alter for neuron record with 1 % but not 0.05-0 .2 % biocytin . 
these effect may be due to a relatively specific blockade of diverse potassium channel type . 
because efficient labeling can be achieve with 0.1 % biocytin with whole-cell recording , higher concentration be contraindicate . 
drug1 : in vitro evaluation of its permeation enhance effect on peptide drug . 
the purpose of this study be to evaluate the effect of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- conjugate on the intestinal permeation of drug5 -lrb- drug6 -rrb- and model peptide drug , drug7 and drug8 . 
drug1 be covalently link to carbodiimide activate drug2 . 
iodometric titration of the polymer conjugate be use to determine the extent of immobilise drug1 . 
permeation study be perform on guinea pig small intestinal mucosa mount in ussing-type chamber . 
unmodified drug1 -lrb- 1 % m/v -rrb- significantly improve the transport ratio -lrb- r = p -lrb- app -rrb- polymer / p -lrb- app -rrb- control -rrb- of drug2 to 1.3 and 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- drug3 conjugate with drug4 further enhance the permeation . 
drug1 conjugation at 3.6 , 5.3 and 7.3 % -lrb- m/m -rrb- result in r-value of 1.4 , 1.7 and 1.8 , respectively . 
decrease the concentration of drug1 , exhibit 7.3 % -lrb- m/m -rrb- of immobilise drug2 -lrb- cmc-cys7 .3 -rrb- from 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- to 0.5 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- decrease the r-value of drug3 from 1.8 to 1.2 . 
drug1 at 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- in the presence of free drug2 have no significant effect on the r-value of drug3 compare to drug4 alone . 
Formulation of fluorescence label drug1 and drug2 in unconjugated drug3 -lrb- 1 % m/v -rrb- do not significantly improve the permeation , however in the presence of 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- drug4 7.3 a significantly improve permeation be observe -lrb- r = 1.3 -rrb- . 
conjugation at drug1 with drug2 moiety significantly improve the intestinal permeation of the hydrophilic molecule drug3 and the model peptide drug drug4 and drug5 in vitro , therefore this conjugate system maybe useful for peroral administration of peptide drug in the future . 
effect of low temperature on microtubule in the non-myelinated axon of post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve . 
the effect of temperature change on the number of microtubule in non-myelinated axon have be study in cat inferior mesenteric ganglion/hypogastric nerve preparation incubate at various temperature in Eagles minimal essential tissue culture medium in vitro . 
at 37 degree c the non-myelinated axon contain 28.4 plus or minus 0.8 s.e.m. 
-lrb- 54 -rrb- microtubule per axon . 
after incubation at 0 degree c for 4 h this number fall to 2.3 plus or minus 0.1 s.e.m. 
-lrb- 41 -rrb- but return to normal level when the nerve be rewarm . 
this loss of microtubule on cool the nerve and they reappearance on rewarm be a rapid process ; 
it be independent of the influence of the nueronal cell body and of protein synthesis within the axon . 
the preservation of the microtubule be improve when d2o be present in the incubation medium . 
Reformed microtubule appear to function normally with respect to they possible role in the transport of noradrenaline storage vesicle along the axon . 
the drug1 for urinary tract infection : a review . 
the drug1 be a rapidly grow class of drug2 with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive aerobic bacterium . 
these agent , include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , have be extensively study and have demonstrate efficacy and safety profile comparable to those of other traditional agent for the treatment of complicated or uncomplicated urinary tract infection and prostatitis . 
advantage offer by this class of drug1 include optimal pharmacokinetic , effectiveness against multidrug-resistant organism , and oral administration even when parenteral drug2 be generally use . 
the drug1 be also extensively use in urologic surgery . 
if take 1 hour before drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , drug3 do not affect drug4 exposure , despite persistent buffering effect . 
concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 significantly reduce the level of exposure to drug3 , but it be unclear how soon after drug4 administration drug5 may be give safely . 
we compare drug1 pharmacokinetic and gastric ph in 12 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient by use of 800 mg of drug2 alone versus 800 mg of drug3 administer 1 h after drug4 administration . 
median gastric ph be significantly higher when drug1 be take after drug2 administration ; 
however , no significant difference in the maximum concentration in plasma or the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 h be observe . 
drug1 may be take with a light meal 1 h follow the administration of 400 mg of drug2 .

Hypothermia as a index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction in the rat . 
decrease core temperature in female rat be investigate as one possible index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction -lrb- der -rrb- . 
core temperature be decrease in rat in a dose-dependent manner when drug1 be administer to rat treat with drug2 8 hour before the drug3 challenge . 
the decrease in temperature begin within 20 minute after drug1 administration , reach a maximal decrease between 60 and 120 minute post drug2 . 
the core temperature return to normal 300 minute after drug1 . 
the blood pressure -lrb- carotid cannulation -rrb- decrease along with the core temperature . 
maximal hypotension be find 120 minute post drug1 , and return to normal 300 minute after drug2 . 
Heart rate increase initially and return to normal 40 minute after drug1 challenge . 
intestinal absorption of drug1 in the chick . 
the intestinal absorption of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- have be investigate in the chick by means of the in situ ligate duodenal loop technique . 
by this procedure , it be observe that drug1 be rapidly and essentially completely absorb -lrb- 80-95 % -rrb- from the lumen at drug2 concentration up to 5 mm , decline to about 50 % absorption at 50 mm . 
transfer from the intestinal lumen to the mucosal cell at low drug1 concentration -lrb- 0.1 mm -rrb- be rapid , while transfer from the mucosal cell to the body occur more slowly . 
at stable drug1 concentration greater than 1 mm , fractional mucosal cell accumulation of drug2 remain constant , while fractional transfer to the body decline . 
however , total mucosal accumulation of drug1 and that transfer to the body increase in a linear logarithmic fashion from 0.05 to 5 mm drug2 . 
the result indicate that drug1 readily penetrate both the mucosal and serosal surface of the epithelial membrane . 
furthermore , drug1 and drug2 do not appear to share a common transport pathway in the duodenum and no evidence be obtain for any interaction between the two at this level . 
drug1 administration to rachitic chick be effective in significantly elevate duodenal drug2 absorption , act primarily to enhance serosal transport . 
drug1 : a update review of its use in the management of schizophrenia . 
drug1 , a drug2 , be a drug3 which have prove efficacy against the positive and negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
compare with drug1 , it have greater affinity for serotonin 5-ht2a than for dopamine d2 receptor . 
in large , well controlled trial in patient with schizophrenia or related psychosis , drug1 5 to 20 mg/day be significantly superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day in overall improvement in psychopathology rating scale and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptom , and be comparable in effect on positive psychotic symptom . 
the 1-year risk of relapse -lrb- rehospitalisation -rrb- be significantly lower with drug1 than with drug2 treatment . 
in the first double-blind comparative study -lrb- 28-week -rrb- of drug1 and drug2 , drug3 10 to 20 mg/day prove to be significantly more effective than drug4 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptom but not on overall psychopathology symptom . 
in contrast , preliminary result from a 8-week controlled study suggest drug1 2 to 6 mg/day be superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptom -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- , although consistent with the first study , both agent demonstrate similar efficacy on measure of overall psychopathology . 
Improvements in general cognitive function see with drug1 treatment in a 1-year controlled study of patient with early-phase schizophrenia , be significantly greater than change see with either drug2 or drug3 . 
however , preliminary result from a 8-week trial show comparable cognitive enhancing effect of drug1 and drug2 treatment in patient with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder . 
several study indicate that drug1 have benefit against symptom of aggression and agitation , while other study strongly support the effectiveness of drug2 in the treatment of depressive symptomatology . 
drug1 be associate with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptom than drug2 and drug3 . 
in addition , drug1 be not associate with a risk of agranulocytosis as see with drug2 or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as see with drug3 or prolongation of the QT interval . 
the most common adverse effect report with drug1 be bodyweight gain , somnolence , dizziness , anticholinergic effect -lrb- constipation and dry mouth -rrb- and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation . 
in comparison with drug1 , the adverse event report significantly more frequently with drug2 in > or = 3.5 % of patient be dry mouth , bodyweight gain and increase appetite and compare with drug3 , only bodyweight gain occur significantly more frequently with drug4 . 
the high acquisition cost of drug1 be offset by reduction in other treatment cost -lrb- inpatient and/or outpatient service -rrb- of schizophrenia . 
pharmacoeconomic analysis indicate that drug1 do not significantly increase , and may even decrease , the overall direct treatment cost of schizophrenia , compare with drug2 . 
compare with drug1 , drug2 have also be report to decrease overall treatment cost , despite the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug . 
drug1 treatment improve quality of life in patient with schizophrenia and related psychosis to a greater extent than drug2 , and to broadly the same extent as drug3 . 
conclusion : drug1 demonstrate superior antipsychotic efficacy compare with drug2 in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia , and in the treatment of some patient with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia . 
the reduce risk of adverse event and therapeutic superiority compare with drug1 and drug2 in the treatment of negative and depressive symptom support the choice of drug3 as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response . 
antimicrobial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with some drug2 . 
antimicrobial activity of drug1 -lrb- the aqueous extract from the carpophore of ganoderma lucidum -lrb- fr -rrb- karst -rrb- be test in vitro against gram positive and gram negative bacterium by serial broth dilution method , and the antimicrobial activity be express by minimal inhibitory concentration -lrb- mic -rrb- . 
among fifteen species of bacterium test , the antimicrobial activity of drug1 be the most potent against Micrococcus luteus -lrb- mic , 0.75 mg/ml -rrb- . 
to investigate the effect of antimicrobial combination of drug1 with four kind of drug2 -lrb- drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 -rrb- , the fractional inhibitory concentration index -lrb- fici -rrb- be determine by checkerboard assay for each strain . 
the antimicrobial combination of drug1 with four drug2 result in additive effect in most instance , synergism in two instance , and antagonism in two instance . 
synergism be observe when drug1 be combine with drug2 against bacillus subtilis and klebsiella oxytoca . 
drug1 protect mouse tumour and normal tissue from the toxicity of oral drug2 . 
because the drug1 drug2 be give exclusively by the oral route in man , we have carry out study in mouse on the antitumour activity , acute toxicity and pharmacokinetic of oral drug3 , either alone or in combination with the chemosensitizer drug4 . 
in both plasma and kht tumour the peak concentration and `` early '' 
auc for total drug1 be about 1.4-1 .5 fold greater for the oral compare to the i.p. 
route . 
these difference be reflect in the roughly twofold greater antitumour activity for the oral route . 
in contrast , acute toxicity test show that oral drug1 be 1.45 time less toxic to normal tissue , although the dose-limiting organ may be different for the two route . 
drug1 reduce the antitumour activity of oral drug2 by dose modifying factor -lrb- dmf -rrb- of 0.58-0 .71 . 
similarly , the acute toxicity be also diminish by a dmf of 0.74 . 
drug1 have a complex effect on oral drug2 pharmacokinetic . 
the plasma and tumour total drug1 peak concentration be reduce by 1.5 and 1.7 fold respectively . 
drug1 also reduce the `` early '' 
drug1 auc , with the extent of the reduction depend on the minimum effective concentration -lrb- mec -rrb- choose . 
for example , the plasma drug1 auc be reduce by factor of 1.05 and 9.6 for mec value of 1 and 2 microgram ml-1 respectively . 
we propose these pharmacokinetic change to be the underlie mechanism for the reduction of oral drug1 cytotoxicity by drug2 . 
clinical trial of such combination should be accompany by detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation . 
pharmacokinetic interaction between single oral dose of drug1 and drug2 in healthy volunteer . 
aim and background : the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 , a drug2 metabolize by cyp3a4 , and the drug3 drug4 be study in 18 healthy subject . 
several clinically important interaction have previously be report for other drug1 that be metabolize by the same enzyme and for drug2 . 
method : healthy subject who be 20 to 43 year old participate in a open , three-period , randomize , crossover study of the pharmacokinetic of a single 10-mg oral dose of drug1 , a single oral 120-mg dose of drug2 , and the two drug give together . 
the three study period be separate by a 21-day washout phase . 
result : the geometric mean -lrb- 90 % confidence interval -rrb- whole blood drug1 area under the plasma concentration time-curve increase 60 % -lrb- 35 % -90 % -rrb- , from 736 to 1178 ng x h/ml , and maximum concentration increase 43 % -lrb- 14 % -81 % -rrb- , from 67 to 96 ng/ml , with drug2 coadministration , whereas the mean elimination half-life of drug3 decrease slightly , from 79 to 67 hour . 
apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of drug1 decrease with 38 % and 45 % , respectively , when drug2 be give with drug3 . 
the plasma maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 be unchanged after coadministration of drug4 , and no potentiation of the effect of drug5 on diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameter be see . 
conclusion : single-dose drug1 coadministration lead to higher drug2 exposure , presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of drug3 . 
because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the drug1 - drug2 interaction , whole blood drug3 concentration should be monitor closely in patient treat with the two drug . 
drug1 , a trans-3 ,4 - dimethyl-4 - -lrb- 3-hydroxyphenyl -rrb- piperidine , prevent gastrointestinal effect of intravenous drug2 without affect analgesia . 
drug1 be a novel drug2 that may selectively prevent drug3 - induce gastrointestinal effect without reverse analgesia . 
gastrointestinal transit time -lrb- lactulose hydrogen breath test -rrb- be measure in 14 volunteer with oral and intravenous placebo , oral placebo and intravenous drug1 -lrb- 0.05 mg x kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- , and oral drug2 -lrb- 4 mg -rrb- and intravenous drug3 -lrb- 0.05 mg x kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- in a double blind , cross-over study . 
drug1 prolong gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minute -lrb- p = .005 -rrb- ; 
drug1 prolong gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minute -lrb- p = .005 -rrb- ; this be prevent by drug2 -lrb- p = .004 -rrb- . 
postoperatively , 45 patient be randomly assign in a double-blind fashion to receive drug1 -lrb- 4 mg -rrb- or placebo and intravenous drug2 -lrb- 0.15 mg/kg -rrb- or to receive oral and intravenous placebo . 
Analgesia and pupil constriction be measure . 
drug1 analgesia and pupil constriction be unaffected by drug2 and differ from placebo -lrb- p < .002 -rrb- . 
we conclude that drug1 prevent drug2 - induce increase in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affect central opioid analgesia . 
the effect of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 on bar-press behavior in normal and genetically nervous dog . 
study on two strain of pointer dog have demonstrate that administration of a drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- facilitate acquisition of goal-directed behavior in `` genetically nervous '' 
subject . 
continue admistration of the drug be require to maintain barpress response in this strain of dog . 
the concomitant administration of either drug1 or drug2 , compound which inhibit neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine , disrupt the behavioral response of the genetically nervous e-strain subject to a far greater extent than the stable a-strain subject . 
it be also show that after 14 day of daily administration of drug1 , withdrawal of the drug not only re-result in almost complete loss of bar-press response in the e-strain subject but also result in a temporary decrease in the acquire behavioral response of the stable a-strain subject . 
therapeutic drug monitoring can avoid iatrogenic alteration cause by drug1 -lrb- mdp -rrb- - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 be a drug2 use to treat a wide variety of infection cause by gram-negative organism , but it be potentially toxic to the kidney . 
due to its nephrotoxicity , drug1 may cause abnormal renal uptake to be see on drug2 bone scintigraphy . 
the presence of the drug1 in the kidney , along with a increase in renal retention , tend to produce scintigraphic result that falsely identify characteristic related to disease such as renal vascular , or urinary tract obstruction , and even renal cancer . 
a altered biodistribution may provide misleading information that can either mask or mimic certain disease symptom . 
a method to maximize the therapeutic benefit of drug1 while minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity and the appearance of a hot kidney on scintigraphy be desirable . 
serial pharmacokinetic dosing have be propose as a method to accomplish this goal . 
therapeutic drug monitoring -lrb- tdm -rrb- of drug1 therapy , and bone scintigraphy employ drug2 as the drug3 be carry out in 22 patient . 
the datum present here demonstrate that with serial pharmacokinetic dosing of drug1 , the iatrogenic alteration cause by drug2 therapy can be avoid . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in anaesthetised horse . 
evoke hind limb digital extensor tension -lrb- hoof twitch -rrb- be maintain at 40 % of baseline for 1 h by drug1 infusion in 7 horse anaesthetise with drug2 . 
after 1 h , drug1 be discontinue and hoof twitch allow to recover to 75 % . 
drug1 be again give by infusion to maintain 40 % twitch for a second hour , then 2 mg drug2 / kg bwt be give i.v. 
drug1 infusion be continue for a third hour , and then hoof twitch be again allow to recover spontaneously to 75 % . 
drug1 reduce twitch strength from 40 + / - 1 % -lrb- mean + / - sem -rrb- to 29 + / - 4 % within 7.0 + / - 1.5 min -lrb- p = 0.02 -rrb- . 
twitch gradually return to pre - drug1 strength over the course of the next hour . 
recovery of hoof twitch from 50 % to 75 % take 7.7 + / - 0.7 min for drug1 alone and 11.5 + / - 2.7 min for drug2 plus drug3 -lrb- p = 0.03 -rrb- . 
recovery from 50 % twitch to 75 % fade recovery take 13.8 + / - 0.8 min for drug1 alone and 13.7 + / - 1.2 min for drug2 plus drug3 . 
at 75 % recovery of fade , hoof twitch be 87 + / - 3 % for drug1 alone and 82 + / - 4 % for drug2 plus drug3 . 
reversal of the block with drug1 and subsequent recovery of the horse from anaesthesia be uneventful . 
it be conclude that , although drug1 do augment the neuromuscular blockade of drug2 , the effect be minimal . 
diagnostic , treatment and aftercare approach to drug1 abuse . 
the general public feel that drug1 be not particularly dangerous because it do not produce a well define physical dependency and abstinence syndrome . 
however , when addiction be define as compulsion , loss of control and continue use in spite of adverse consequence , drug1 drug hunger can be see as a agent of addictive disease . 
withdrawal from drug1 dependence usually involve depression , anxiety and lethargy . 
these usually clear within a week , leave only the `` drug hunger '' 
to contend with . 
medication be rarely need . 
when drug1 be the primary addiction , after withdrawal the most effective treatment be group therapy with other recover cocaine abuser . 
we incorporate the principle of recovery and define positive and constructive alternative in deal with cocaine hunger . 
recovery program should be flexible and involve individual and family education on recovery and the nature of addictive disease . 
exercise that produce cardiopulmonary stimulation be a helpful means of reduce drug hunger and anxiety during recovery therapy . 
systemic drug1 . 
understand the breadth of systemic drug1 available for use by the dermatologist and they associate side-effect profile and drug interaction allow the clinician to offer patient optimal care in the management of cutaneous infectious disease . 
altered responsiveness to drug1 after exposure to organic lead . 
drug1 be know to effect the functional integrity of the limbic system , particularly the hippocampus , and to alter behavior which be think to be mediate through limbic function . 
organometal also compromise the limbic system and result in deficit in learning and memory . 
since both drug1 and organolead be present in the environment and seem to influence limbic integration , the interaction of these two compound be assess in the present experiment . 
thirty male rat of the fischer-344 strain be divide into three equal group and be give injection of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- -lrb- 8.0 or 17.0 mg/kg/ml sc -rrb- or the saline vehicle . 
fourteen day later , all animal be challenge with a single hypnotic dose of drug1 -lrb- 3.5 g/kg IP -rrb- . 
the 20 % v/v solution of drug1 be prepare in water from a stock solution of 95 % drug2 . 
the latency to loss of the right reflex and duration of sleep time be record while the rat be keep in sound-attenuating chamber . 
the rat treat with the highest dose of drug1 manifest significantly longer latency to lose the right reflex and shorter duration of sleep than do control . 
these result suggest that exposure to environmental drug1 may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of a animal to drug2 . 
evidence for reduction of drug1 uptake site in the fail human heart . 
objective . 
this study investigate the role of neuronal uptake of drug1 -lrb- uptake-1 -rrb- in human heart failure as a local factor for alter concentration of norepinephrine at the cardiac myocyte membrane . 
background . 
several beta-adrenergic neuroeffector defect occur in heart failure . 
whether a alteration in drug1 uptake-1 occur be still unresolved . 
method . 
the role of drug1 uptake-1 be study in electrically stimulate -lrb- 1 hz , 37 degree c -rrb- human ventricular cardiac preparation and isolate myocardial membrane . 
result . 
the effectiveness of drug1 in increase the force of contraction be decrease in relation to the degree of heart failure . 
in contrast , the potency of drug1 be increase in fail heart -lrb- New York Heart Association functional class iv -rrb- in relation to the concentration produce 50 % of the maximal effect -lrb- ec50 -rrb- . 
the ec50 value for drug1 , which be not a substrate for drug2 uptake-1 , be reduce in myocardium in functional class ii to iii and iv compare with those in nonfailing myocardium . 
the uptake inhibitor drug1 and drug2 -lrb- 3 mumol/liter -rrb- potentiate the positive inotropic effect of drug3 in nonfailing myocardium -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- but not in functional class iv myocardium . 
radioligand binding experiment use the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-3 drug1 reveal a significant decrease by approximately 30 % in drug2 uptake-1 carrier density in functional class ii to iii and iv myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- . 
conclusion . 
in human heart failure , there be a presynaptic defect in the sympathetic nervous system , lead to reduce uptake-1 activity . 
this defect in the fail heart can be mimic by the effect of uptake block agent , such as drug1 and drug2 , in the nonfailing heart only . 
compromise drug1 uptake-1 in functional class iv can not be further increase by drug2 and drug3 . 
the pathophysiologic consequence could be a increase synaptic concentration of drug1 predispose to adenylyl cyclase desensitization . 
the mechanism of drug1 - induce vasorelaxation differ in the mesenteric resistance artery of lean and obese rat . 
drug1 have be show to induce vasorelaxation . 
in this study , we investigate the mechanism -lrb- s -rrb- of drug1 - induce vasorelaxation in resistance mesenteric artery from male lean and dietary-induced obese rat . 
compare with lean rat , artery from dietary-obese rat show significant -lrb- p < 0.001 -rrb- endothelial dysfunction , as indicate by a decrease -lrb- > 20 % -rrb- in maximal acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation . 
drug1 -lrb- 5-35 micromol/l -rrb- induce concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric artery preconstrict with drug2 -lrb- 8 micromol/l -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- 125 mmol/l -rrb- from both lean and dietary-obese rat . 
there be no significant difference between the two group , achieve a maximum relaxation of > 95 % at a concentration of 35 micromol/l . 
however , drug1 -lrb- 100 and 300 micromol/l -rrb- do not alter the effect of drug2 on artery from dietary-obese rat , give superimpose concentration-response curve . 
drug1 be also ineffective in alter drug2 activity in artery from both lean and dietary-obese rat . 
in drug1 - precontracted artery from dietary-obese rat , response to drug2 be not attenuate by endothelial denudation , indicate a action independent of the endothelium . 
this study indicate that : -lrb- a -rrb- the maximal effect of drug1 on resistance artery from lean and dietary-obese rat be not effect by endothelial dysfunction , and -lrb- b -rrb- the effect of drug2 in lean animal -lrb- where endothelial function be not impaired -rrb- , but not in dietary-obese rat , be mediate via no . 
drug1 : a iga-binding lectin . 
we previously report that seed of Artocarpus integrifolia -lrb- jackfruit -rrb- contain a lectin , which we call drug1 , that be both a potent t cell mitogen and a apparently t cell-independent activator of human b cell for the secretion of immunoglobulin . 
during the above experiment we note a massive precipitation in cell culture stimulate with greater than or equal to 100 microgram of lectin . 
in this paper , we show that the precipitate be form after the interaction of drug1 and the serum protein add to the culture medium . 
more importantly , we demonstrate that iga be probably the major serum constituent precipitate by the lectin and that no igg or igm can be detect in the precipitate . 
in secretion such as colostrum , iga be the only protein precipitate by drug1 . 
on the basis of this specificity we describe a simple and reliable affinity chromatography procedure for the purification of both human serum and colostrum iga . 
drug1 be a d-gal binding lectin and should be a useful tool for study of serum and secretory iga . 
-lsb- 2 epidemic of arsenical encephalopathy in the treatment of trypanosomiasis , Uganda , 1992-1993 -rsb- since 1988 , the french non-governmental organisation m decin san Fronti re be run a control program of human african trypanosomiasis in the district of Moyo , North-Uganda . 
between 1988 and 1993 , more than 7,000 patient be diagnose and treat . 
since 1988 , it have be note that incidence of drug1 reaction have increase systematically between June and October of each year , indicate strong seasonal variation . 
in 1992 and 1993 , two outbreak of arsenical reactive encephalopathy -lrb- be -rrb- occur in the sleep sickness center of Adjumani . 
the incidence of be suddenly exceed 10 % of the patient treat by drug1 during August 1992 and September 1993 . 
the onset of 80 % of those `` epidemic '' 
case , occur between the 5th and the 11th day of treatment . 
two retrospective study be conduct in 1992 -lrb- 75 case -rrb- and in 1993 -lrb- 51 case -rrb- . 
among the risk factor study , two appear to increase the risk of be : the prescription of drug1 to treat strongyloidiasis during the drug2 cure and the bad general clinical condition of patient . 
these observation suggest that exogenous co-factor could be involve in the occurrence of be . 
recommendation be to avoid administration of diffusible drug1 treatment during the cure , and to improve the general condition of patient before the cure of drug2 . 
behavioral response to repeat drug1 exposure in mouse selectively breed for differential sensitivity to drug2 . 
mouse from the 20th generation of three line divergently select for response to drug1 - induce sedation time -lsb- long-sedation time -lrb- lst -rrb- , short sedation time -lrb- sst -rrb- , and randomly breed control -lrb- rbc -rrb- -rsb- be use to study drug2 - induce behavioral sensitization . 
these line show variable degree of locomotor activity in response to drug1 . 
at a low drug1 dose and long withdrawal period -lrb- 10 mg/kg , twice a day for 5 day follow by a 14-day withdrawal -rrb- , the LST mouse show tolerance development . 
in response to drug1 , the locomotor activity of the SST be not significantly different from the rbc group . 
at a higher dose and a shorter withdrawal period -lrb- 20 mg/kg , daily for 7 day follow by a 3-day withdrawal -rrb- , the SST mouse show behavioral sensitization similar to the rbc mouse , but the lst mouse do not develop sensitization . 
the different response in locomotor activity induce by drug1 suggest that genetic factor may play a role in determine the magnitude of response to this drug . 
dopamine -lrb- da -rrb- level do not differ significantly in either striatum -lrb- str -rrb- or nucleus accumben -lrb- nac -rrb- for the drug1 - treat animal to they corresponding saline-treated control . 
the affinity -lrb- kd -rrb- of d2 in the nac decrease significantly , without change in density -lrb- bmax -rrb- , in the drug1 - treat SST and RBC mouse . 
on the other hand , the density of d2 binding site in the SST and the rbc mouse in the str be significantly increase in drug1 - treated group without change in kd . 
the lst mouse do not show any change in the kd and bmax in either the str or the nac . 
take together , these finding suggest that the change in the kd of d2 in the nac and the bmax of d2 in the str may contribute to the difference in locomotor response to drug1 exposure in these mouse line . 
drug1 inhibit the cyp2c9 catalyze biotransformation of drug2 . 
objective : we objective be to examine the interaction between drug1 and drug2 to confirm that drug3 inhibit cyp2c9 . 
method : the study be carry out as a open , randomize , crossover design with 14 healthy participant . 
in period a , all volunteer take 500 mg of drug1 orally . 
in period b , the volunteer be randomly assign to one of two group . 
each group take either 150 mg or 75 mg of drug1 a day for 5 day -lrb- day -3 to day 2 -rrb- . 
the group then take 500 mg of drug1 as a single dose -lrb- day 0 -rrb- . 
in both period , blood and urine be sample at regular interval . 
plasma be analyze for drug1 , and urine be analyze for drug2 and its two metabolite , drug3 and drug4 by means of hplc . 
result : during treatment with drug1 , there be a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of drug2 , from 845 ml/h to 688 ml/h , among the volunteer who receive 75 mg/d . 
there be a reduction that reach borderline statistical significance in the group that receive 150 mg/d of drug1 . 
the clearance by means of drug1 and drug2 be significantly reduce in both group -lrb- ie , from 901 ml/h to 318 ml/h in the group that receive 150 mg of drug3 per day and from 723 ml/h to 457 ml/h in the group that receive 75 mg of drug4 per day -rrb- . 
thus there be a tendency toward a more pronounced inhibition of the 4-hydroxylation during treatment with 150 mg/d of drug1 compare with 75 mg/d , but the difference be not statistically significant . 
conclusion : drug1 be a moderate inhibitor of cyp2c9 in vivo . 
influence of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism . 
available datum indicate that platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism be important factor in hemostasis and regulation of vascular tone . 
plasma membrane and intracellular mobilization of calcium ion be intimately relate to platelet activation and release of platelet contents . 
Release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid as well as subsequent synthesis and release of vasoconstrictor thromboxane a2 be also regulate by movement of calcium ion . 
adenosine 3 ' :5 ' - cyclic phosphate in turn control level of free calcium ion in platelet and regulate calcium-dependent reaction . 
drug1 , such as drug2 , drug3 and drug4 , inhibit platelet activation in vitro , and decrease platelet adhesion intravascularly . 
these agent have also be show to decrease platelet nucleotide release and thromboxane a2 generation . 
some preliminary datum suggest that drug1 also increase generation of vasodilator and platelet antiaggregant prostacyclin , which could contribute to decrease in platelet function . 
these effect of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism could contribute in part to they efficacy in patient with ischemic heart disease . 
pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular drug in patient with chronic renal disease . 
Cardiovascular disease be a common comorbidity and a major cause of mortality in patient with chronic renal disease . 
drug regimen in patient with cardiovascular disease be frequently complex and can be significantly affect by alteration in renal function . 
in addition , several cardiovascular drug directly affect renal function and the management of patient with renal disease . 
this article review the impact of renal disease on the pharmacokinetic of cardiovascular drug and identify clinically important interaction between these and other drug commonly use in the management of chronic renal disease . 
several class of cardiovascular drug be also discuss in relationship to they differential effect on the management and progression of renal disease . 
influence of drug1 and drug2 on the sensitivity of rat thoracic aorta to drug3 . 
the aim of this study be to investigate the effect of low and high dose of drug1 , and of drug2 on the response to drug3 in rat thoracic aorta . 
two week after bilateral ovariectomy , female rat receive a s.c. 
injection of vehicle -lrb- corn oil , 0.1 ml/day -rrb- , drug1 -lrb- 10 microg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day -rrb- and/or drug2 -lrb- 20 mg/kg/day -rrb- , for eight day . 
on the ninth day , the rat be sacrifice and aortic ring , with or without endothelium , be use to generate concentration-response curve to drug1 . 
aortic ring with intact endothelium from the high-dose -lrb- 4 mg/kg/day -rrb- drug1 group be supersensitive to drug2 compare to the vehicle or low-dose -lrb- 10 microg/kg/day -rrb- estradiol group -lrb- pd2 value = 7.86 + / -0.09 , 7.30 + / -0.11 and 7.35 + / -0.04 , respectively -rrb- . 
endothelium-intact aortic ring from high - drug1 rat be supersensitive to drug2 when compare to vehicle - , drug3 - and drug4 + high - drug5 - treat rat -lrb- pd2 value = 7.77 + / -0.12 , 7.21 + / -0.13 , 6.93 + / -0.04 and 7.22 + / -0.18 , respectively -rrb- . 
there be no significant difference among the pd2 value for drug1 in aortic ring without endothelium . 
both of these effect be endothelium-dependent . 
drug1 and therapeutics . 
two different type of therapy with drug1 be use : physiological oral drug2 supplementation which be totally atoxic since it palliate drug3 deficiency by simply normalize the drug4 intake and pharmacological drug5 therapy which may induce toxicity since it create iatrogenic drug6 overload . 
primary and secondary drug1 deficiency constitute the sole indication of physiological oral drug2 therapy . 
it be therefore necessary to be well acquaint with the clinical and paraclinical pattern of drug1 deficit and to discriminate between drug2 deficiency due to a insufficient drug3 intake which only require oral physiological supplementation and drug4 depletion related to a dysregulation of the control mechanism of drug5 status which require more or less specific regulation of its causal dysregulation . 
physiological oral drug1 load constitute the best tool for diagnosis of drug2 deficiency and the first step of its treatment . 
physiological oral drug1 supplementation -lrb- 5 mg/kg/day -rrb- be easy and can be carry out in the diet or with drug2 s , with practically only one contra-indication : overt renal failure . 
specific and aspecific treatment of drug1 depletion be tricky use for example drug2 , pharmacological dose of drug3 , physiological dose of drug4 and of drug5 . 
in order to use the pharmacological property of induce therapeutic hypermagnesaemia , high oral dose of drug1 -lrb- > 10 mg/kg/day -rrb- be advisable for chronic indication and the parenteral route be suitable for acute indication . 
there be 3 type of indication : specific -lrb- for the treatment of some form of drug1 deficit i.e. acute -rrb- , pharmacological -lrb- i.e. without alteration of drug2 status -rrb- and mixed -- pharmacological and aetiopathogenic -- -lrb- for example complication of chronic alcoholism -rrb- . 
today pharmacological drug1 therapy mainly concern the obstetrical , cardiological and anaesthesiological field . 
the main indication be eclampsia , some dysrhythmia -lrb- torsade de pointe particularly -rrb- and myocardial ischaemia . 
but it be now difficult to situate the exact place of the pharmacological indication of drug1 . 
drug1 infusion can only be envisage in intensive care unit with careful monitoring of pulse , arterial pressure , deep tendon reflex , hourly diuresis , electrocardiogram and respiratory recording . 
high oral drug1 dose besides they laxative action may bring latent complication which may reduce lifespan . 
there may remain some indication of the laxative and antacid property of non soluble drug1 , particularly during intermittent haemodialysis . 
lastly local use of the mucocutaneous and cytoprotective property of drug1 be still valid , in drug2 and for preservation of transplant particularly . 
the effect of drug1 and drug2 upon drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- - induce locomotion and behavioral change in mouse . 
the behavioral change of mouse induce by acute and repeated i.p. 
injection of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- be observe by measure locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior . 
then , the effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor -lrb- mglur -rrb- agonist , drug1 and drug2 , on the above behavioral change induce by drug3 be find . 
the effect of drug1 be very strong and completely depress the drug2 - induce hyperlocomotion . 
the effect of drug1 be not so strong . 
repeated injection of drug1 for 20 day into mouse induce lower locomotor activity than that in acutely inject mouse . 
these behavioral change may be relate with the negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
in order to examine some molecular mechanism of drug1 - induce behavioral change , northern blot analysis of total rna from prefrontal cortical tissue of mouse treat with drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 be carry out . 
lack of a effect of drug1 on the disposition of drug2 and drug3 in hiv-infected patient . 
two study be conduct in hiv-infected subject to assess the potential for drug1 to interact with drug2 and drug3 . 
both study use 12 subject . 
the drug1 study dose subject with 1200 mg/day of drug2 -lrb- n = 7 -rrb- -lrb- later change to 600 mg/day -lsb- n = 5 -rsb- -rrb- for day 8 to 21 of a 21-day course of 100 mg , five times/day of drug3 . 
subject treat with 200 mg of drug1 twice daily for 21 day receive 1200 mg of drug2 or a equivalent amount of placebo/day for day 8 to 21 . 
drug1 plasma and urine sampling be conduct on day 1 , 7 , and 21 for drug2 and on day 7 and 21 for drug3 . 
peripheral mononuclear cell be also collect for quantitation of phosphorylate drug1 . 
drug1 have no significant impact on the cmax and auc of drug2 , although it significantly decrease the drug3 tmax by 44 % and increase the intracellular exposure to phosphorylate drug4 by 110 % . 
drug1 have no significant effect on drug2 pharmacokinetic . 
base on the result of these study , it be conclude that drug1 may be safely coadminister with both drug2 and drug3 . 
clinical implication of drug1 interaction with five drug2 . 
the intensity , uniformity and time course of drug1 interference by drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 be systematically investigate in 16 patient receive drug7 therapy . 
each subject receive a individualized fixed daily dose of drug1 and serve as he own pre - and postsedative treatment control . 
Prothrombin time be measure four time weekly during five long-term experiment . 
anticoagulant inhibition be observe during the administration of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ; 
there be no significant change in prothrombin test result during the trial of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 and drug2 should not be administer to patient receive drug3 . 
the concurrent use of drug from these group be decrease accord to a survey of 200 hospital medical record . 
drug1 and drug2 interact pharmacologically with orally administer drug3 , but the effect be not clinically significant . 
it be conclude that drug1 and drug2 may be administer safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral drug3 therapy . 
interaction of the constituent of alcoholic beverage in the promotion of liver damage . 
Little have be study of the adverse effect of the exposure of the liver to the interaction of drug1 with its congener and drug2 , coexist in the contents of alcoholic beverage . 
twenty four male Wistar rat be divide into four group . 
two group -lrb- sh/da ; sh/fa -rrb- be submit to daily treatment with synthetic hydroalcoholic solution contain drug1 , drug2 , higher drug3 and drug4 in the same proportion as those find in most common distil and ferment alcoholic beverage ; 
the third group -lrb- sh/ea -rrb- be treat with a hydroalcoholic solution of drug1 ; 
the fourth group serve as control and receive a equivalent volume of a isocaloric solution of drug1 . 
all the animal be kill at the end of the 9th week of the experiment . 
the ratio between the liver weight and body weight be find to be lower in the treated animal than in the control group . 
the histology of the liver be alter in the three group which be submit to treatment with the hydroalcoholic solution , with quantitative and qualitative difference between the group . 
these result suggest that the hepatoxicity of drug1 in alcoholic beverage be enhance by interaction with its congener and drug2 ; 
they also suggest that alcoholic beverage be not equivalent in they potential to cause liver damage . 
administration of drug1 prophylaxis . 
successful prophylaxis of manic-depressive disorder require more than the prescription of drug1 . 
the administrative arrangement in a area of Scotland be accompany by a 300 % increase in the frequency of admission for mania , whereas in a area of the West Midlands , a large decrease be achieve . 
effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 in healthy volunteer . 
the author examine the effect of the cyclooxygenase-2 -lrb- cox-2 -rrb- inhibitor , drug1 , at steady state on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 follow a single dose in healthy subject . 
each healthy subject -lrb- n = 10 -rrb- receive drug1 -lrb- 75 mg once daily -rrb- or placebo for 11 day in a double-blind , randomize , balanced , two-period crossover study . 
a single 0.5 mg oral dose of drug1 elixir be administer on the 7th day of each 11-day period . 
each treatment period be separate by 14 to 21 day . 
sample for plasma and urine immunoreactive drug1 concentration be collect through 120 hour follow the drug2 dose . 
no statistically significant difference between treatment group be observe for any of the calculate drug1 pharmacokinetic parameter . 
for drug1 auc -lrb- 0-infinity -rrb- , auc -lrb- 0-24 -rrb- , and Cmax , the geometric mean ratio -lrb- 90 % confidence interval -rrb- for -lrb- drug2 + drug3 / placebo + drug4 -rrb- be 1.04 -lrb- 0.94 , 1.14 -rrb- , 1.02 -lrb- 0.94 , 1.09 -rrb- , and 1.00 -lrb- 0.91 , 1.10 -rrb- , respectively . 
the drug1 median tmax be 0.5 hour for both treatment . 
the harmonic mean elimination half-life be 45.7 and 43.4 hour for drug1 + drug2 and placebo + drug3 treatment , respectively . 
drug1 be eliminate renally . 
the mean -lrb- sd -rrb- cumulative urinary excretion of immunoreactive drug1 after concurrent treatment with drug2 or placebo be 228.2 -lrb- + / - 30.8 -rrb- and 235.1 -lrb- + / - 39.1 -rrb- micrograms/120 hour , respectively . 
transient and minor adverse event occur with similar frequency on placebo and drug1 treatment , and no treatment-related pattern be apparent . 
drug1 do not influence the plasma pharmacokinetic or renal elimination of a single oral dose of drug2 . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and drug3 : comparison of antiaddictive efficacy , toxicity , and mechanism of action . 
drug1 , a novel iboga alkaloid congener , be be develop as a potential treatment for multiple form of drug abuse . 
like drug1 -lrb- 40 mg/kg -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 40 mg/kg -rrb- decrease the intravenous self-administration of drug3 and drug4 and the oral self-administration of drug5 and drug6 in rat ; 
unlike drug1 , drug2 do not affect respond for a nondrug reinforcer -lrb- water -rrb- . 
both drug1 and drug2 ameliorate drug3 withdrawal sign . 
both drug1 and drug2 decrease extracellular level of dopamine in the nucleus accumben , but only drug3 increase extracellular level of serotonin in the nucleus accumben . 
both drug1 and drug2 block drug3 - induce and drug4 - induce dopamine release in the nucleus accumben ; 
only drug1 enhance drug2 - induce increase in accumbal dopamine . 
both drug1 and drug2 enhance the locomotor and/or stereotypic effect of stimulant . 
drug1 attenuate , but drug2 potentiate , the acute locomotor effect of drug3 ; 
both compound attenuate drug1 - induce locomotion in drug2 - experienced rat . 
drug1 produce whole body tremor and , at high dose -lrb- > or = 100 mg/kg -rrb- , cerebellar damage ; 
drug1 do not produce these effect . 
drug1 , but not drug2 , decrease heart rate at high dose . 
while drug1 and drug2 have similar affinity for kappa opioid and possibly nicotinic receptor , drug3 have much lower affinity than drug4 for nmda and sigma-2 receptor , sodium channel , and the 5-ht transporter . 
both drug1 and drug2 be sequester in fat and , like drug3 , drug4 probably have a active metabolite . 
the datum suggest that drug1 have a narrower spectrum of action and will have a substantially greater therapeutic index than drug2 . 
effect of coadministered drug and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drug to human serum in vitro . 
the effect of coadministered drug and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drug to human serum in vitro be investigate . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 be add to pooled human serum at therapeutic concentration . 
to each preparation be add one additional drug at three concentration range from therapeutic to toxic . 
the follow eight target drug/added drug combination be study : drug1 / drug2 . 
drug1 / drug2 , drug3 / drug4 , drug5 / drug6 , drug7 / drug8 , drug9 / drug10 , drug11 / drug12 , and drug13 / drug14 . 
each serum without the other add drug as well as the serum supplement with the other drug at the three concentration be dialyze against phosphate buffer . 
similarly dialyze be drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 , both alone at therapeutic concentration in serum and with drug4 at three different concentration in serum . 
the percentage of drug binding in each preparation be calculate . 
drug1 diminish the binding of drug2 to human serum by a net change of 5.7 % -lrb- percentage increase in free drug fraction -lsb- fdf -rsb- , 11.0 % -rrb- at 662 micromol/l and by a net change of 7.1 % -lrb- percentage increase in FDF , 13.7 % -rrb- at 1324 micromol/l . 
drug1 decrease the binding of drug2 by a net change of 6.8 % -lrb- percentage increase in FDF , 8.8 % -rrb- at 277.5 micromol/l ;

no significant effect be note with other drug combination or with the addition of drug1 . 
coingestion of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 with drug4 , and drug5 with drug6 at high to toxic concentration decrease the binding of the target drug . 
the result increase in free drug concentration may lead to enhance drug effect in vivo . 
effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 . 
the effect of drug1 on the steady-state pharmacokinetic of drug2 be evaluate in a randomize , double-blind study . 
five day of drug1 treatment do not significantly affect steady-state pharmacokinetic variable of drug2 compare with placebo ; 
therefore , the use of drug1 do not necessitate a adjustment in drug2 dose to maintain therapeutic digoxin level . 
acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of drug1 in anhydrous and aqueous drug2 solution . 
the drug1 be a family of drug2 and drug3 . 
when take concurrently with drug1 , a pharmacological interaction may occur , potentiate the central nervous system depression produce by either drug . 
in addition to this pharmacological interaction , this report describe a novel chemical reaction between drug1 -lrb- a drug2 -rrb- and drug3 under acidic condition similar to those find in vivo , result in a 3-ethoxylated product . 
optimal condition , kinetics , equilibrium , and the mechanism of this acid-catalyzed ethanolysis be report . 
the result raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume drug1 and drug2 on a regular basis . 
the acid-catalyzed drug1 - drug reaction be a relatively unexplored area and may alter the pharmacological action of some drug . 
inhibitory effect of drug1 on inositol 1,4 , 5-trisphosphate-induced response in rat megakaryocyte . 
the effect of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- on drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- - induce response be study in rat bone marrow megakaryocyte with the patch-clamp whole-cell recording technique in combination with fura-2 microfluorometry . 
internal application of drug1 -lrb- 100 microm -rrb- increase intracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- concentration -lrb- -lsb- ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- -rrb- and activate the ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- - dependent k -lrb- + -rrb- current . 
administer drug1 together with drug2 -lrb- 100-500 microm -rrb- inhibit insp -lrb- 3 -rrb- - induce response -lrb- both ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- and current response -rrb- in a dose-dependent fashion . 
pretreatment of megakaryocyte with extracellular drug1 -lrb- 50 microm -rrb- also inhibit drug2 - induce response . 
intracellular and extracellular application of drug1 reduce adp-induced increase in -lsb- ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- . 
in contrast , in isolate single pancreatic acinar cell , drug1 have no effect on drug2 - induce response . 
take together , these result suggest that the site of the inhibitory action of drug1 be at the insp -lrb- 3 -rrb- receptor , or its closely associated protein . 
in addition , we have show that drug1 be a useful pharmacological tool with which to examine the drug2 - mediated response of megakaryocyte . 
concomitant drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 chemotherapy plus drug5 therapy in patient with human immunodeficiency virus-related , non-hodgkin lymphoma . 
background : the feasibility and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and drug1 therapy -lrb- haart -rrb- be still unknown in patient with human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- - related malignancy . 
to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy plus haart on the clinical course of patient with hiv-related , systemic , non-hodgkin lymphoma -lrb- hiv-nhl -rrb- , the author compare retrospectively a group of 24 patient with hiv-nhl who be treat with the drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -lrb- chop -rrb- chemotherapy regimen plus haart with a group of 80 patient who be treat with chop chemotherapy or a chop-like regimen -lrb- i.e. , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 with drug9 plus drug10 -rrb- without receive drug11 therapy . 
method : all patient be enrol in two sequential trial perform at the Aviano Cancer Center , Italy , from April 1988 to December 1998 . 
HAART be include with combination therapy from January 1997 . 
drug1 regimen consist of two drug2 and one drug3 . 
result : the two treatment group be well match with regard to patient demographic , nhl characteristic , hiv status , and treatment , i.e. , the number of cycle and chemotherapy dose . 
the response rate be similar between the two group . 
severe anemia -lrb- Grade 3-4 accord to the World Health Organization criterion -rrb- be significantly greater in the patient who receive CHOP-HAART compare with the patient who receive chop alone -lrb- 33 % vs. 7 % , respectively ; p = 0.001 -rrb- . 
leukopenia be similar between the two group , but colony stimulating factor support be significantly greater in the CHOP-HAART group than in the control group -lrb- 92 % vs. 66 % , respectively ; p = 0.03 -rrb- . 
seventeen percent of chop-haart patient develop severe autonomic neurotoxicity , whereas none of the chop patient develop neurotoxicity -lrb- p = 0.002 -rrb- . 
at similar median follow-up , opportunistic infection -lrb- oi -rrb- rate and mortality be significantly lower in the chop-haart patient than in the chop patient -lrb- 18 % vs. 52 % , respectively ; p = 0.05 ; and 38 % vs. 85 % , respectively ; p = 0.001 -rrb- . 
the median survival for chop-haart patient be not reach , whereas the medial survival of chop patient be 7 month -lrb- p = 0.03 -rrb- . 
conclusion : the combination of chop plus haart be feasible and may reduce the morbidity from oi in hiv-nhl patient . 
however , careful attention must be direct to cross toxicity and possible pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
the impact of the combined chemotherapy plus haart treatment on patient survival need urgently to be evaluate in prospective study . 
drug1 and drug2 : a drug interaction . 
the drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 be not well know . 
drug1 have be report to increase the drug2 requirement in human subject ingest these agent simultaneously . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 result in the need for a unusually high maintenance dose of drug3 -lrb- 20 mg per day -rrb- in order to produce a therapeutic effect . 
withdrawal of drug1 decrease the drug2 requirement by 50 % . 
this effect may be mediate by the ability of drug1 to induce microsomal enzyme and , thus , the catabolism of drug2 . 
the effect of drug1 on the drug2 requirement of we patient appear to be maximal 5 to 7 day after the initiation of drug3 and extend a similar length of time after drug4 withdrawal . 
this interaction appear to be clinically significant . 
increase stability of nucleophosmin/b23 in anti-apoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
we obtain evidence that increase stability of nucleophosmin/b23 be involve in antiapoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
nucleophosmin/b23 in serum-deprived -lrb- 0 % serum -rrb- nih-3t3 cell be find to be highly unstable with a half-life less than 4 h . 
in contrast , nucleophosmin/b23 in serum-deprived ras-transformed -lrb- ras-3t3 -rrb- cell be as stable as that in serum-supplemented nih-3t3 or ras-3t3 cell . 
treatment of ras-3t3 cell with nucleophosmin/b23 antisense oligomer significantly potentiate the apoptosis induce by serum deprivation . 
much less caspase-3 activity be note in the lysate derive from serum-deprived ras-3t3 cell compare with that in the lysate of serum-deprived nih-3t3 cell . 
cell permeable caspase-3 inhibitor add in the medium block the decrease of nucleophosmin/b23 and apoptosis induce by serum deprivation in nih-3t3 cell . 
the inhibitor , on the other hand , promote significant decrease of nucleolin/c23 in nih-3t3 cell during serum deprivation . 
unlike nucleolin/c23 , down-regulation of nucleophosmin/b23 be thus not proliferation-dependent but caspase-3 - and apoptosis-dependent . 
we result indicate important relationship among ras , nucleophosmin/b23 , activation of caspase-3 , and induction of apoptosis . 
drug1 : mammalian target of drug2 inhibitor to prevent kidney rejection . 
current immunosuppressive therapy be effective but can be associate with significant adverse reaction . 
drug1 work differently from the drug2 currently available , and except for increase lipid level , the adverse reaction profile of drug3 do not appear to overlap to any great extent with that associate with drug4 or drug5 . 
while additional research be need , the initial clinical datum in kidney recipient suggest that drug1 , in combination with drug2 or drug3 , might have the potential to reduce the frequency of rejection episode , permit reduction in drug4 or drug5 dosage , and permit steroid withdrawal -lrb- Kelly , 1999 -rrb- . 
Development and pharmacology of drug1 . 
drug1 be the first drug2 to be approve for clinical use , and have be study extensively in human since 1986 . 
it be structurally distinct from the other currently available drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -rrb- , lead to unique biopharmaceutical property relative to the other agent of this class . 
absorption of drug1 be virtually complete across all species , include man , and be not affect by the presence of food . 
systemic exposure be limit , as drug1 be subject to first-pass metabolism , and the plasma half-life of the drug be approximately 30 minute . 
some 95 % of a single dosage of drug1 be excrete via the biliary route , with less than 2 % of this be the parent compound . 
additionally , there be no evidence of circulate active metabolite or accumulation during chronic dosing . 
study of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic of drug1 have demonstrate marked reduction in the rate of bioavailability -- from 40 % to 60 % ; 
however , a comparison of drug1 administration with the evening meal or at bedtime have reveal no significant difference in the extent of bioavailability -lrb- area under the curve -rrb- of these two regimen . 
furthermore , no significant difference in pharmacodynamic effect -lrb- reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level -rrb- could be ascertain between mealtime dosing and bedtime dosing . 
the pharmacokinetic of drug1 have also be assess in various demographic group . 
relative to the general population , plasma concentration of drug1 do not vary as a function of either age or gender . 
in addition , administration to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency result in a 2.5-fold increase in both the rate and extent of bioavailability relative to control . 
also , although minimal alteration of drug1 clearance in patient with renal insufficiency be anticipate due to limited renal excretion -lrb- 5 % -rrb- , a study in this patient group be currently underway to examine this further . 
interaction study have be perform with drug1 and several drug with which it might be coadminister . 
drug1 , a anionic-binding resin , have a considerable effect in lower the rate and extent of drug2 bioavailability . 
although this effect be note even when drug1 be give 4 hour prior to drug2 , this regimen do not result in diminish efficacy . 
further , no effect on either drug1 level or prothrombin time be observe in a study involve concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 . 
moreover , additional interaction study with drug1 and drug2 have not demonstrate any effect on drug3 plasma level , and administration to a patient population chronically receive drug4 result in no difference in the extent of bioavailability of drug5 relative to control datum . 
the result generate to date in clinical pharmacokinetic study with drug1 thus support its use in a broad population of hypercholesterolaemic patient . 
molecular basis for the selective toxicity of drug1 for yeast and drug2 for animal cell . 
among the drug1 , many , like drug2 , can not be use clinically because they be toxic ; 
drug1 , however , be useful in therapy of human fungal infection because it be less toxic . 
both the toxicity of drug1 and the therapeutic value of drug2 can be rationalize at the cellular and molecular level by the follow observation : -lrb- i -rrb- these drug3 show differential effect on cell ; 
drug1 be more potent in lyse human red blood cell , whereas drug2 be more potent in inhibit yeast cell growth ; 
and -lrb- ii -rrb- the effect of drug1 be more efficiently inhibit by add cholesterol , the major membrane sterol in human cell , whereas the effect of drug2 be more efficiently inhibit by ergosterol , the major membrane sterol in yeast . 
the simplest inference be that the toxicity and effectiveness of polyene be determine by they relative avidity for the predominant sterol in cell membrane . 
-lsb- hippocampus as interaction site between cerebral memory system -rsb- most of the current theory assume that there be multiple form of memory that be support by separate brain system and have different characteristic . 
animal study on the various dual-memory theory have be carry out mainly on the basis of hippocampal system function . 
specifically , they have focus on aspect of learning and memory that be impaired -lrb- vs. spare -rrb- by lesion of the hippocampal formation . 
however , there be several instance in the animal literature show that hippocampal lesion actually produce enhance learning and memory function . 
moreover , the acquisition of task that be facilitate by hippocampal lesion -lrb- or dysfunction -rrb- be nevertheless associate , in intact subject , with specific neurobiological alteration in the hippocampus . 
this problem have be analyse use two different task in mouse : a bar-press conditioning and a spatial discrimination task . 
result show that , depend on the task consider , the same pharmacological treatment produce either a facilitation or a impairment of acquisition . 
moreover , each task induce significant alteration in hippocampal adenylate cyclase activity but in opposite direction . 
together with previous finding , these result suggest that the hippocampus be involve in both the so-called `` hippocampal-dependent '' 
`` hippocampal-independent '' 
form of memory . 
it be postulate that some of the observe training-induced neurobiological alteration might reflect the interaction between two -lrb- or more -rrb- compete memory system at the hippocampal level . 
thus , in addition to its propose specific information processing function -lrb- i.e. , relational -rrb- , the hippocampus would play a role in address information to the brain memory system that , in a give situation , have the best adaptive value . -lrb- abstract truncate at 250 word -rrb- 
behavioral mechanism underlie the link between smoking and drinking . 
many people use both drug1 and drug2 -lrb- i.e. , cigarette and other tobacco product -rrb- . 
the behavioral effect of these two drug differ , and they do not act on the same target site in the brain , although they may share , or partly share , certain property . 
the initiation of drug1 or drug2 use may be precipitate by similar personality characteristic in the user , such as impulsivity and sensation seek . 
moreover , the mechanism underlie the development of dependence may be similar for drug1 and drug2 . 
thus , certain factor , such as reinforce drug effect , conditioning process , automatic behavior , and stress , may influence the development of dependence on both drug . 
other factor , such as tolerance and sensitization to the drug ' action and the development of withdrawal symptom , may also contribute to dependence . 
this review discuss the action of the two drug on certain brain chemical -lrb- i.e. , neurotransmitter -rrb- system and the extent to which the effect of the two drug may interact . 
Vancomycin resistance reversal in enterococci by flavonoid . 
the development of clinical vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococci -lrb- vre -rrb- be a major cause for concern . 
here we show that a combination of drug1 or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone with drug2 may be use to sensitize resistant strain of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to the level of vancomycin-sensitive strain . 
Minimum inhibitory concentration -lrb- mic -rrb- and viable count be determine in iso-sensitest broth use a microtitre method . 
mic of drug1 against 67 % of resistant clinical isolate and a type strain of enterococcus be lower from > 250 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- to 1 
4 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- in the presence of drug1 -lrb- 12.5 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone -lrb- 6.25 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- . 
viable count for type culture E. 
faecalis atcc 51299 show the flavonoid alone significantly lower number of colony form unit -lrb- cfus -rrb- . 
cfus be maintain at low level -lrb- 10 -lrb- 3 -rrb- CFU ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- for 24 h by drug1 / flavone combination . 
this combinational action in reverse vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlight novel drug target and have importance in the design of new therapeutic regime against resistant pathogen . 
lack of interaction between drug1 and drug2 : pharmacokinetic and drug disposition . 
previous study have demonstrate a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of drug1 and drug2 when administer concomitantly with a intravenous drug3 such as drug4 . 
this decrease in absorption result in a 36 % and 50 % lower auc for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , which could cause clinical failure . 
the author investigate the possibility of a similar interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
eight healthy volunteer be randomize in a open-label , two-way crossover study to receive drug1 , 5 mg p.o. 
q4h , and drug1 , 500 mg p.o. 
1 hour after start the drug1 or drug2 500 mg p.o. 
alone . 
blood sample be draw at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 , and 24 hour for Cmax , tmax , and auc determination . 
there be not a significant difference -lrb- p > 0.05 -rrb- in auc -lrb- 48.59 + / - 8.52 vs. 49.9 + / - 9.93 -rrb- , cmax -lrb- 7.73 + / - 2.6 vs. 6.6 + / - 2.0 -rrb- , and tmax -lrb- 1.1 + / - 0.6 vs. 1.6 + / - 1.1 -rrb- for drug1 versus drug2 / drug3 regimen . 
it be conclude that oral drug1 and drug2 can be administer concomitantly without a significant decrease in auc , cmax , or tmax . 
the mode of toxic action of the pesticide drug1 : the metabolism of drug2 to drug3 . 
the biochemical toxicology of drug1 , a known metabolite of the major ingredient of the pesticide drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , be investigate in vivo and in vitro . 
rat kidney homogenate supplement with coenzyme a , atp , oxaloacetate , and mg2 + convert drug1 to drug2 in vitro . 
administration of drug1 -lrb- 100 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to rat in vivo result in drug2 synthesis in the kidney , which be precede by a elevation in fluoride level and follow by citrate accumulation . 
animal dose with drug1 do not display the 2-3 hour lag phase in either drug2 synthesis or in citrate and fluoride accumulation characteristic of animal dose with drug3 . 
we demonstrate that the conversion of drug1 to drug2 by a NAD + - dependent oxidation be the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the toxic product , drug3 from drug4 . 
prior administration of drug1 -lrb- 90 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- be show to prevent the conversion of drug2 -lrb- 100 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to drug3 in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevation see in drug4 - intoxicated animal . 
however , administration of drug1 -lrb- 90 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to rat 2 hour prior to drug2 -lrb- 100 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- be ineffective in prevent drug3 synthesis and do not diminish fluoride or citrate accumulation in vivo . 
we conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal property of drug1 see in animal treat with drug2 derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD + - dependent oxidation responsible for convert drug3 to drug4 in the committed step of the toxic pathway . 
drug1 - induce oxidative stress in rat brain and liver be prevent by drug2 or drug3 . 
consider that the involvement of reactive oxygen species -lrb- ros -rrb- have be implicate in the toxicity of various pesticide , this study be design to investigate the possibility of oxidative stress induction by drug1 , a drug2 . 
either single -lrb- 170 mg/kg -rrb- or repeat -lrb- 75 mg/kg per day for 5 day -rrb- oral administration of drug1 be find to produce significant oxidative stress in cerebral and hepatic tissue of rat , as be evident by the elevation of the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance -lrb- tbar -rrb- in both tissue , either 4 or 24 h after treatment . 
much higher change be observe in liver , increase from a level of 60 % at 4 h up to nearly 4 time the control at 24 h for single dose . 
reduce level -lrb- up to 20 % -rrb- of total glutathione -lrb- total gsh -rrb- , and elevation of conjugate diene -lrb- approximately 60 % in liver by single dose at 4 h -rrb- also indicate the presence of a oxidative insult . 
glutathione-s-transferase -lrb- gst -rrb- activity , however , do not differ from control value for any dose or at any time point in cerebral and hepatic tissue . 
pretreatment of rat with drug1 -lrb- 100 mg/kg , ip -rrb- or drug2 -lrb- 100 mg/kg per day , ig , for 3 day and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day -rrb- provide significant protection against the elevation of tbar level in cerebral and hepatic tissue , induce by single high dose of oral drug3 administration within 4 h. 
thus , the result suggest that drug1 exposure of rat result in free radical-mediated tissue damage , as indicate by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation , which be prevent by drug2 and drug3 . 
serum drug1 level use a 125i-labelled antigen : validation of method and observation on cardiac patient . 
1 . 
determination of serum drug1 level utilize commercially available kit with a 125i-labelled antigen be precise and not materially different from result obtain with a 3h-labelled antigen . 
2 . 
in order to approximate the steady state level , serum drug1 level should be draw either before or at least six hour follow the administration of a oral tablet . 
3 . 
concomitantly give drug1 do not interfere with the absorption of a tablet of drug2 . 
4 . 
in the digitalized patient , slow alteration in serum level after oral administration appear well correlate with , at least , the negative chronotropic effect of the drug . 
5 . 
maximal exercise testing , a maneuver often apply to cardiac patient , do not significantly alter the serum drug1 level . 
analysis of drug1 - induce diarrhea in cecectomized rat . 
the drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- - induce diarrhea be analyze in cecectomized rat prepare by resect the cecum and its vasculature without disturb the ileocecal junction . 
drug1 -lrb- 0.1-1 .0 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- 
dose-dependently increase the number of defecation episode and induce a soft and watery stool in cecectomized rat . 
at 0.3 mg/kg , the diarrhea-inducing effect of drug1 be more pronounced in cecectomize than in control rat . 
when give i.p. , drug1 -lrb- 0.3 mg/kg -rrb- induce a watery stool in cecectomize and control rat with the same efficacy , although these effect be short-lasting as compare to oral administration . 
drug1 -lrb- 4 ml/kg , p.o. -rrb- 
also induce diarrhea , but do not produce a watery stool in cecectomized rat . 
there be no difference between cecectomized and control rat in basal small intestinal transit or in drug1 -lrb- 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- - induce enhancement . 
moreover , the basal and drug1 - induce jejunal net fluid transfer be the same in cecectomize and in control rat . 
on the other hand , the enhance secretion of colonic fluid by drug1 , give intraluminally , be only half of that in control rat , whereas the colonic transit-enhancing effect of drug2 in cecectomized rat be more pronounced than in control rat at 15 but not at 30 min after its administration . 
the basal colonic fluid contents and transit be the same in cecectomize and in control rat . 
drug1 and drug2 -lrb- 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- 
drug1 and drug2 -lrb- 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- inhibit the drug3 -lrb- 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- - induce diarrhea in cecectomized rat . 
drug1 -lrb- 5 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- 
drug1 -lrb- 5 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- completely antagonize the inhibitory effect of drug2 and partly antagonize the effect of drug3 . 
these result suggest that oral administration of drug1 induce a more pronounced secretory diarrhea in cecectomize than in control rat , probably due to the lack of the reservoir function of the cecum in the operate animal . 
this secretory diarrhea model be suitable for evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of drug . 
drug1 as potent drug2 of glucocorticoid-induced mouse mammary tumor virus gene expression . 
the effect of natural and synthetic galloyl ester on glucocorticoid-induced gene expression be evaluate by use rat fibroblast 3y1 cell stably transfect with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional regulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus drug1 . 
the glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription be strongly suppress by synthetic alkyl ester ; 
drug1 show the most potent inhibition -lrb- 66 % inhibition at 10 microm -rrb- , which be far more potent than that of crude drug2 . 
n-octyl and n-cetyl gallate also show good inhibition , while gallic acid itself be not so active , suggest that the presence of hydrophobic side chain be important for the suppressive effect . 
on the other hand , surprisingly , drug1 , -lrb- - -rrb- - epigallocatechin-3-o-gallate and theasinensin a , potently enhance the promoter activity -lrb- 182 and 247 % activity at 1 microm , respectively -rrb- . 
the regulation of the level of the glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by the antioxidative gallate be of great interest from a therapeutic point of view . 
high-dose drug1 with drug2 protection . 
nephrotoxicity frequently limit the dose of drug1 to less than 120 mg/m2 per injection . 
drug1 be a neutralize agent for drug2 that protect against renal damage . 
to determine whether injection of drug1 would permit larger dose of drug2 to be administer , a fix 9.9-g / m2 dose of drug3 be give intravenously over three hour concurrently with escalate dose of drug4 . 
drug1 be administer over the last two hour of the drug2 infusion . 
use this technique , it be possible to escalate the drug1 dose to 225 mg/m2 before dose-limiting toxicity be encounter . 
comparison of drug1 pharmacokinetic in patient treat with 202.5 mg/m2 plus drug2 to those in patient treat with 100 mg/m2 without drug3 indicate that there be no change in the elimination rate constant , volume of distribution , or total body clearance of drug4 . 
the total drug exposure for the plasma be approximately twofold at the higher drug1 dose . 
this study demonstrate that concurrent administration of drug1 permit at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to drug2 . 
interaction on the antinociceptive effect between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 . 
the aim of this paper be to study the interaction between drug1 and both drug2 or its synthetic analogue drug3 , or drug4 , on the antinonciceptive effect of these peptide in mouse after intracisternal injection . 
antinociception be measure by the hot-plate method . 
it be show that drug1 antagonize evidently the antinociceptive effect of drug2 and they analogue . 
on the contrary , drug1 and drug2 be agonist in induction of analgesia . 
it be conclude that drug1 modulate in a opposite way the function of the enkephalinergic neuron and the central action of drug2 . 
the emerge role of drug1 in drug2 therapy . 
the availability of potent drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- - base regimen for drug3 therapy and concern regard drug4 -lrb- drug5 -rrb- - related metabolic disturbance have lead to significant shift in treatment practice in hiv infection . 
drug1 - base regimen may have several advantage over drug2 - base therapy for initial or prolonged therapy , include more convenient administration regimen , lower tablet volume , fewer drug interaction , and central nervous system penetration . 
no datum from prospective clinical trial currently exist compare the 3 approve agent -lrb- drug1 , drug2 or drug3 -rrb- . 
both drug1 and drug2 have be compare to triple therapy with the drug3 drug4 over 48 week as initial therapy , with similar response be observe with drug5 regimen and superiority observe with drug6 . 
a smaller 24-week study have suggest drug1 may be superior to the drug2 drug3 . 
limited comparative datum in patient with high viral load treat with drug1 - or drug2 - base regimen currently exist . 
however , cohort datum and select patient datum from clinical trial suggest comparable activity to drug1 - base regimen in these patient . 
the superiority of drug1 over drug2 - base regimen have be observe in comparative datum in a subset of patient with high viral load . 
in treatment-experienced patient , available uncontrolled datum suggest these agent contribute to regimen efficacy in drug1 - na have , treatment-experienced patient . 
drug1 have demonstrate superiority over drug2 in nucleoside-experienced patient , although combine these 2 agent may represent the best approach in these circumstance . 
the tolerability of drug1 appear generally good with few individual discontinue in clinical study as a result of adverse drug event . 
the majority of adverse event with drug1 occur within the first month , and be predictable and manageable without therapy interruption . 
suppression by drug1 of drug2 - enhance peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinoma induce by drug3 in wistar rat . 
background : the effect of combined administration of drug1 and drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , a drug4 , on the incidence of peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinoma induce by drug5 -lrb- drug6 -rrb- and the labeling index of intestinal cancer be investigate in male Wistar rat . 
method : from the beginning of the experiment , rat be give 10 weekly subcutaneous injection of drug1 -lrb- 7.4 mg/kg body weight -rrb- and subcutaneous injection of drug2 -lrb- 40 microg/kg body weight -rrb- every other day , and from week 16 , intraperitoneal injection of drug3 -lrb- 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight -rrb- every other day until the end fo the experiment in week 45 . 
result : drug1 significantly increase the incidence of intestinal tumor and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum . 
although drug1 administer at either dose have little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by drug2 or on the location , histologic type , depth of involvement , label index , apoptotic index or tumor vascularity of intestinal cancer , it significantly decrease the incidence of cancer metastasis . 
drug1 also significantly decrease the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinoma , which be enhance by drug2 . 
conclusion : these finding indicate that drug1 inhibit cancer metastasis through action that do not affect the growth of intestinal cancer . 
-lsb- dose-time effect of competitive displacement of drug1 by drug2 follow oral and intravenous administration -rsb- the effect of various dose of drug3 in several dose fraction on the extent and the time scale of displacement of drug4 , in dependence on application mode , be study . 
a intravenous dose of 50 mg drug1 be in respect of competitive suppression of organ actively concentrate drug2 as effective as intravenous 1000 mg clo-4 - simultaneously or 1000 mg orally 30 min before the injection of drug3 . 
a intravenous injection of drug1 give later also produce a complete and immediately begin depletion of drug2 already accumulate in the thyroid , within a period of 195 min after 99m-tco-4-injection with a corresponding increase in blood level . 
20 mg result in incomplete depletion which become complete after a second additional dose . 
the intravenous application of drug1 offer advantage in clinical use . 
combination of drug1 and drug2 : effect on drug discrimination and behavioral inhibition in rat . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- produce psychotomimetic effect in human that resemble schizophrenia symptom . 
in a effort to screen compound for antipsychotic activity , preclinical researcher have investigate whether these compound block drug1 - induce behavior in animal . 
in the present study , the drug1 drug2 be test in combination with a active dose of drug3 in two-lever drug discrimination and mixed signalled-unsignalled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate -lrb- drl -rrb- procedure . 
drug1 produce distinctive effect in each task : it substitute for the training dose in drug2 discrimination and it increase the number of response with short -lrb- < 3 s -rrb- interresponse time as well as increase overall response rate in the DRL schedule . 
acute dosing with drug1 fail to alter the behavioral effect of drug2 in either procedure even when test up to dose that produce pharmacological effect alone . 
these result suggest that acute dosing with drug1 would not affect behavior most closely associate with drug2 intoxication . 
further , they bring into question the utility of use drug1 combination procedure in animal to screen for antipsychotic potential . 
since chronic dosing be require for therapeutic efficacy of drug1 , future study should focus on investigation of chronic dosing effect of these drug in combination with drug2 . 
-lsb- multiple occupational exposure to solvent -rsb- this article review papers publish over the last 20 year on multiple occupational exposure to solvent . 
at low-level of exposure the toxicokinetic interference between solvent have generally not be observe in man and presumably a threshold limit exist . 
conversely , at exposure level close to the `` limit value '' 
metabolic interference have sometimes be observe and the behaviour of the biological indicator differ from what would be expect . 
toxicodynamic interference between solvent can give rise to additive , potentiation , synergistic , antagonistic effect . 
for the identification of `` limit value '' , it have generally be suggest in the literature that the possible effect derive from multiple exposure be consider as additive . 
however , numerous potentiation effect have frequently be report for combined exposure to substance of widespread use . 
in this paper list of multiple exposure in which the dose of the substance , the type of interference and the behaviour of the biological level have be draw up and propose as a tool for easy consultation . 
drug1 and drug2 exert additive ocular and renal vasodilator effect on healthy human . 
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : there be evidence that drug1 and drug2 cause renal and ocular vasodilation . 
there be , however , currently no datum on the effect of combined hyperglycaemia and hyper drug1 aemia on the renal and ocular blood flow see in diabetic patient on insulin therapy . 
method : we carry out two different 3-way crossover study in healthy subject -lrb- each , n = 9 -rrb- . 
in study one , hyperglycaemic clamp -lrb- 5.6 mmol/l , 11.1 mmol / 1 , 16.7 mmol/l -rrb- be carry out during placebo or drug1 -lrb- dose 1 : 1 mu/kg/min ; dose 2 : 2 mu/kg/min -rrb- infusion . 
the second study be identical but endogenous insulin secretion be block with drug1 . 
the renal plasma flow , glomerular filtration rate and pulsatile choroidal blood flow be measure use the paraaminohippurate method , the inulin method and a laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude , respectively . 
result : drug1 increase renal plasma flow and fundus pulsation amplitude but not the glomerular filtration rate . 
hyperglycaemia increase all the renal and ocular parameter study . 
haemodynamic effect of drug1 and drug2 be additive when drug3 be co-administered but not under basal condition . 
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : drug1 and drug2 can exert additive vasodilator property on renal and ocular circulation . 
to find out whether this observation be relate to the increase regional perfusion in diabetes longitudinal study on patient with type i -lrb- insulin-dependent -rrb- diabetes mellitus be need . 
interaction between drug1 and antidiuretic hormone and its effect on the milk secretion by alveolus of the mammary gland of lactating rat . 
interaction between exogenous and endogenous drug1 and vasopressin be find to affect the mechanism of milk ejection by the alveolus of the mammary gland in lactating rat . 
inhibition and stimulation of the effect of drug1 on milk ejection by vasopressin be demonstrate . 
on the basis of the principle observe the concentration fo these hormone be investigate in the plasma of dog deprive of water for 3 day and then allow to drink . 
-lsb- quantitative approach to treatment with incisive drug1 by therapeutic monitoring -rsb- ; the problem encounter during the longterm treatment of psychotic patient with drug2 be illustrate by six typical case report . 
a group of patient who have have a new acute episode despite seemingly adequate treatment be select . 
in these six case it be demonstrate that the drug1 dosage be inappropriate , be either too high or too low as judge from the plasma concentration . 
Ways of improve the adequacy of the treatment of psychotic patient with drug1 be discuss . 
longitudinal assessment of drug1 in de novo renal transplant recipient over the first post-transplant year : pharmacokinetic , exposure-response relationship , and influence on drug2 . 
objective : we objective be to characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetic of drug1 and drug2 -lrb- inn , drug3 -rrb- when coadminister in de novo kidney allograft recipient during the first year after transplantation . 
method : this study be a multicenter randomize double-blind study of 101 patient who be randomly assign 1:1:1 to receive drug1 tablet at dose of 0.5 mg , 1 mg , or 2 mg twice daily with drug2 and drug3 . 
blood sampling for the pharmacokinetic of drug1 and drug2 be perform on day 1 , on week 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , and on month 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 . 
drug1 dose-proportionality and stability over time be assess in the context of linear regression and ANOVA model . 
drug1 exposure-response relationship between area under the blood concentration-time curve -lrb- auc -rrb- and change in platelet , leukocyte , and lipid be explore with the median-effect model . 
potential difference in drug1 dosing and pharmacokinetic at different level of drug2 exposure be assess in the context of ANOVA . 
result : drug1 steady state be reach on or before day 7 , with a median 3-fold accumulation of drug exposure compare with that after the first postoperative dose . 
both steady-state maximum concentration and auc be dose proportional over the full dose range when assess on day 1 , as well as for the full duration of the study at steady state . 
there be evidence for longitudinal stability in auc of drug1 during the course of the study . 
the interindividual pharmacokinetic variability for auc be 85.4 % and intraindividual , interoccasion variability be 40.8 % . 
age -lrb- range , 17-69 year -rrb- , weight -lrb- range , 49-106 kg -rrb- , and sex -lrb- 65 man and 36 woman -rrb- be not significant contributor to variability . 
there be a increase incidence of transient thrombocytopenia -lrb- or = 100 x 10 -lrb- 9 -rrb- / l -rrb- with increase drug1 auc -lrb- p = .03 -rrb- . 
drug1 dose , trough concentration , and auc exhibit similar temporal pattern during the course of the study regardless of the co-administered drug2 dose level -lrb- p = .13 , .82 , and .76 , respectively -rrb- . 
conclusion : drug1 exhibit dose-proportional , stable exposure during the first post-transplant year . 
for a 4-fold range of drug1 dose there be no differential effect on drug2 dosing or pharmacokinetic . 
toxicity of cadmium and drug1 to encystment and in vitro excystment of Parorchis acanthus -lrb- digenea : Philophthalmidae -rrb- . 
the toxicity of cadmium , drug1 and cadmium/zinc mixture at concentration range from 1000 to 50000 microg/l be investigate against cercaria and metacercaria of Parorchis acanthus obtain from the dog whelk nucella lapillus .
