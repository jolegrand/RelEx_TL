serum drug1 concentration appear to be unaffected by baseline use of medication for the treatment of crohn s disease include drug2 , drug3 -lrb- drug4 or drug5 -rrb- and aminosalicylate . 
when give concurrently the follow drug may interact with drug1 . 
- drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 : potentiation of otthostatic hypotension may occur 
. 
- drug1 : -lrb- oral agent and drug2 -rrb- dosage adjustment of the drug3 may be require 
. 
- other drug1 : additive effect or potentiation 
. 
- drug1 and drug2 drug3 : drug4 and drug5 drug6 have the potential of binding drug7 and reduce drug8 absorption from the gastrointestinal tract 
. 
- drug1 , drug2 : intensify electrolyte depletion , particularly hypokalemia 
. 
- pressor amine -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- : possible decrease response to pressor amine but not sufficient to preclude they use 
. 
- drug1 , nondepolarizing -lrb- e.g. , drug2 -rrb- : possible increase responsiveness to the drug3 
. 
- drug1 : generally should not be give with drug2 . 
drug1 reduce the renal clearance of drug2 and add a high risk of drug3 toxicity . 
refer to the package insert for drug1 preparation before use of such preparation with drug2 
. 
- drug1 : in some patient , the administration of a drug2 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effect of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 . 
therefore , when drug1 and drug2 be use concomitantly , the patient should be observe closely to determine if the desire effect of the drug3 be obtain 
. 
- drug/laboratory test interaction : drug1 should be discontinue before carry out test for parathyroid function . 
caution should be exercise when the follow drug be administer concomitantly with drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- give with drug3 or drug4 - drug5 combination product . 
for patient receive drug1 , see contraindication . 
drug1 -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- and drug5 may reduce the therapeutic effect of drug6 . 
in addition , the beneficial effect of drug1 in Parkinsons disease have be report to be reverse by drug2 and drug3 . 
patient take these drug with drug1 and drug2 or drug3 - drug4 combination product should be carefully observe for loss of therapeutic response . 
drug1 salt may reduce the bioavailability of drug2 and drug3 . 
the clinical relevance be unclear . 
although drug1 may increase the bioavailability of drug2 by increase gastric emptying , drug3 may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic property . 
drug that may increase drug1 plasma concentration cyp3a4 inhibitor : drug2 be a cyp3a4 substrate . 
concomitant use of drug1 and drug that inhibit cyp3a4 -lrb- eg , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 -rrb- may increase exposure to drug13 and should be avoid . 
in patient receive treatment with drug1 , close monitoring for toxicity and a drug2 dose reduction should be consider if systemic administration of a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor can not be avoid . 
drug that may decrease drug1 plasma concentration cyp3a4 inducer : drug that induce cyp3a4 activity may decrease drug2 plasma concentration . 
in patient in whom cyp3a4 inducer -lrb- eg , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 -rrb- be indicate , alternative agent with less enzyme induction potential should be use . 
if drug1 must be administer with a cyp3a4 inducer , a dose increase in drug2 should be consider . 
St. Johns wort -lrb- hypericum perforatum -rrb- may decrease drug1 plasma concentration unpredictably . 
patient receive drug1 should not take St. Johns wort . 
drug1 : nonclinical datum demonstrate that the solubility of drug2 be ph dependent . 
simultaneous administration of drug1 with drug2 should be avoid . 
if drug1 therapy be need , the antacid dose should be administer at least 2 hour prior to or 2 hour after the dose of drug2 . 
drug1 / drug2 : long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by drug3 or drug4 -lrb- eg , drug5 and drug6 -rrb- be likely to reduce drug7 exposure . 
the concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 with drug3 be not recommend . 
the use of drug1 should be consider in place of drug2 or drug3 in patient receive drug4 therapy . 
drug that may have they plasma concentration alter by drug1 cyp3a4 substrate : drug2 be a time-dependent inhibitor of cyp3a4 . 
therefore , cyp3a4 substrate know to have a narrow therapeutic index such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , or drug11 -lrb- drug12 , drug13 -rrb- should be administer with caution in patient receive drug14 . 
hepatic impairment there be currently no clinical study with drug1 in patient with impaired liver function -lrb- clinical study have exclude patient with alt and/or AST 2.5 time the upper limit of the normal range and/or total bilirubin 2 time the upper limit of the normal range -rrb- . 
metabolism of drug1 be mainly hepatic . 
caution be recommend in patient with hepatic impairment . 
renal impairment there be currently no clinical study with drug1 in patient with impaired renal function -lrb- clinical study have exclude patient with serum creatinine concentration 1.5 time the upper limit of the normal range -rrb- . 
drug1 and its metabolite be minimally excrete via the kidney . 
since the renal excretion of unchanged drug1 and its metabolite be 4 % , a decrease in total body clearance be not expect in patient with renal insufficiency . 
drug interaction study have not be perform with drug1 . 
no formal drug-drug interaction study have be perform . 
no confirm interaction have be report between drug1 and other drug 
drug1 Inhalation Aerosol have be use concomitantly with other drug , include drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , commonly use in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 
with the exception of drug1 , there be no formal study fully evaluate the interaction effect of drug2 Inhalation Aerosol and these drug with respect to effectiveness . 
drug1 : although drug2 be minimally absorb into the systemic circulation , there be some potential for a additive interaction with concomitantly use drug3 . 
caution be therefore advise in the coadministration of drug1 Inhalation Aerosol with other drug2 - contain drug . 
concomitant treatment with drug1 -lrb- eg , rt-pa or drug2 -rrb- may : - increase the risk of bleed complication - considerably enhance the effect of drug3 on aptt prolongation 
concomitant treatment with drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and drug that affect platelet function may also increase the risk of bleeding . 
co-administration of drug1 at steady-state with a single dose of drug2 . 
co-administration of drug1 at steady-state with a single dose of drug2 -lrb- 2 x 600 mg tablet -rrb- result in increase drug3 serum concentration . 
although a dose adjustment of drug1 be not recommend when administer in combination with drug2 , close monitoring for known side effect of drug3 , such as liver enzyme abnormality and hear impairment , be warrant . 
drug1 do not affect the prothrombin time response to a single dose of drug2 . 
however , prudent medical practice dictate careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patient treat with drug1 and drug2 concomitantly . 
concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 in clinical practice have be associate with increase anticoagulant effect . 
drug interaction study be perform with drug1 and other drug likely to be co-administer . 
when use in therapeutic dose , drug1 have a modest effect on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 -lrb- intravenous and oral -rrb- , drug13 , drug14 / drug15 or drug16 . 
co-administration with drug1 or drug2 have a modest effect on the pharmacokinetic of drug3 . 
no dosage adjustment of either drug be recommend when drug1 be co administer with any of the above agent . 
interaction with the drug list below have not be report in clinical trial with drug1 ; 
however , no specific drug interaction study have be perform to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction . 
nonetheless , they have be observe with drug1 . 
until further datum be develop regard drug interaction when drug1 and these drug be use concomitantly , careful monitoring of patient be advise : drug2 elevated drug3 concentration . 
drug1 or drug2 acute ergot toxicity characterize by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 concentration . 
Laboratory Test interaction there be no report laboratory test interaction . 
repeat treatment study evaluate the use of repeat course of drug1 have not be conduct . 
oral drug1 : drug2 appear to increase catabolism of vitamin k-dependent clotting factor . 
if oral drug1 be also be give , compensatory increase in clotting factor synthesis be impaired . 
patient stabilize on oral drug1 who be find to require drug2 replacement therapy should be watch very closely when thyroid be start . 
if a patient be truly hypothyroid , it be likely that a reduction in drug1 dosage will be require . 
no special precaution appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy be begin in a patient already stabilize on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug1 or oral drug2 : initiate thyroid replacement therapy may cause increase in drug3 or oral drug4 requirement . 
the effect see be poorly understand and depend upon a variety of factor such as dose and type of drug1 and endocrine status of the patient . 
patient receive drug1 or oral drug2 should be closely watch during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug1 : drug2 bind both drug3 and drug4 in the intestine , thus impair absorption of these drug5 . 
in vitro study indicate that the binding be not easily remove . 
therefore , 4 to 5 hour should elapse between administration of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 , oral drug2 : drug3 tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin -lrb- tbg -rrb- . 
in a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who be receive thyroid replacement therapy , free drug1 may be decrease when drug2 be start thus increase drug3 requirement . 
however , if the patient thyroid gland have sufficient function , the decrease free drug1 e will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine output by the thyroid . 
therefore , patient without a function drug1 gland who be on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase they thyroid dose if drug2 or drug3 - contain oral drug4 be give . 
drug1 : use of drug2 with drug3 and other drug4 may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmia have be observe . 
drug1 activity may also be enhance . 
drug1 : drug2 may potentiate the toxic effect of drug3 . 
thyroid hormonal replacement increase metabolic rate , which require a increase in drug1 dosage . 
drug1 : when administer to patient on a drug2 , this parenteral drug3 may cause hypertension and tachycardia . 
use with caution and be prepare to treat hypertension , if necessary . 
drug1 s : drug2 increase the adrenergic effect of catecholamine such as drug3 and drug4 . 
therefore , injection of these agent into patient receive drug1 increase the risk of precipitate coronary insufficiency especially in patient with coronary artery disease . 
careful observation be require . 
drug/laboratory test interaction the following drug or moiety be know to interfere with laboratory test perform in patient on drug1 therapy : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , oral drug5 contain drug6 , drug7 - contain preparation and the numerous preparation contain drug8 . 
- change in tbg concentration should be take into consideration in the interpretation of t4 and t3 value . 
in such case , the unbound -lrb- free -rrb- hormone should be measure . 
pregnancy drug1 and drug2 - contain oral drug3 increase tbg concentration . 
tbg may also be increase during infectious hepatitis . 
decrease in tbg concentration be observe in nephrosis , acromegaly and after drug1 or drug2 therapy . 
familial hyper - or hypo-thyroxine-binding-globulinemia have be describe . 
the incidence of tbg deficiency approximate 1 in 9000 . 
the binding of thyroxine by thyroxine-binding prealbumin -lrb- tbpa -rrb- be inhibit by drug1 
. 
- medicinal or dietary drug1 interfere with all in vivo test of radio-iodine uptake produce low uptake which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone synthesis 
. 
- the persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicate either poor patient compliance , poor absorption , excessive fecal loss , or inactivity of the preparation . 
intracellular resistance to drug1 be quite rare . 
drug1 injection and drug2 should not be administer simultaneously because both drug be direct cardiac stimulant and they combined effect may induce serious arrhythmia . 
the drug may , however , be administer alternately provide a proper interval have elapse between dose . 
drug1 should be use with caution , if at all , when potent inhalational drug2 such as drug3 be employ because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effect of drug4 . 
take drug1 after drink drug2 may worsen side effect and may cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse . 
in vitro mix of a drug1 with beta-lactamtype drug2 -lrb- drug3 or drug4 -rrb- may result in a significant mutual inactivation . 
even when a drug1 and a drug2 - type drug be administer separately by different route , a reduction in drug3 serum half-life or serum level have be report in patient with impaired renal function and in some patient with normal renal function . 
usually , such inactivation of the drug1 be clinically significant only in patient with severely impaired renal function . . 
see 
no formal drug interaction study have be conduct . 
the effect of drug1 may be potentiate by drug2 which inhibit the metabolism of drug3 . 
the pressor effect of drug1 and other drug2 can combine to cause dangerous hypertension . 
administration of 0.1-mg / kg -lrb- 2 x ed95 -rrb- drug1 at 10 % or 95 % recovery follow a intubate dose of drug2 -lrb- 1 mg/kg -rrb- produce 95 % neuromuscular block . 
the time to onset of maximum block follow drug1 be approximately 2 minute faster with prior administration of drug2 . 
prior administration of drug1 have no effect on the duration of neuromuscular block follow initial or maintenance bolus dose of drug2 . 
infusion requirement of drug1 in patient administer drug2 prior to infusion of drug3 be comparable to or slightly greater than when drug4 be not administer . 
the use of drug1 before drug2 to attenuate some of the side effect of drug3 have not be study . 
although not study systematically in clinical trial , no drug interaction be observe when drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 be administer follow vary degree of recovery from single dose or infusion of drug4 . 
drug1 or drug2 administer with drug3 / drug4 to achieve 1.25 MAC -lsb- Minimum alveolar concentration -rsb- may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance dose of drug5 and decrease the require infusion rate of drug6 . 
the magnitude of these effect may depend on the duration of administration of the volatile agent . 
fifteen to 30 minute of exposure to 1.25 MAC drug1 or drug2 have minimal effect on the duration of action of initial dose of drug3 and therefore , no adjustment to the initial dose should be necessary when drug4 be administer shortly after initiation of volatile agent . 
in long surgical procedure during drug1 or drug2 anesthesia , less frequent maintenance dosing , lower maintenance dose , or reduce infusion rate of drug3 may be necessary . 
the average infusion rate requirement may be decrease by as much as 30 % to 40 % . 
in clinical study drug1 have no effect on the duration of action or dosing requirement for drug2 . 
other drug which may enhance the neuromuscular block action of drug1 such as drug2 include certain drug3 -lrb- e. g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 -rrb- , drug12 salt , drug13 , local drug14 , drug15 , and drug16 . 
resistance to the neuromuscular block action of drug1 have be demonstrate in patient chronically administer drug2 or drug3 . 
while the effect of chronic drug1 or drug2 therapy on the action of drug3 be unknown , slightly shorter duration of neuromuscular block may be anticipate and infusion rate requirement may be higher . 
drug/laboratory test interaction none know . 
in clinical study , drug1 have be co-administer with other anti-asthma medication , include inhale and oral drug2 , and inhale drug3 , with no evidence of increase frequency of adverse event or laboratory abnormality . 
no formal drug-drug interaction study , however , have be conduct . 
drug1 can interact with drug2 or other drug3 -lrb- may potentiate the cns depressant effect of either these medication or drug4 -rrb- , drug5 or other medication with anticholinergic activity -lrb- anticholinergic effect may be potentiate when these medication be use concurrently with drug6 -rrb- , and drug7 -lrb- concurrent use with drug8 may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and cns depressant effect of drug9 -rrb- . 
drug1 such as drug2 -lrb- e.g. , drug3 -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- e.g. , drug5 -rrb- , drug6 -lrb- e.g. , drug7 -rrb- , drug8 -lrb- e.g. , drug9 -rrb- , and drug10 -lrb- e.g. , drug11 -rrb- : use these medicine with drug12 may increase the chance of side effect . 
addition or deletion of any drug from the therapeutic regimen of patient receive oral drug1 may affect patient response to the drug2 . 
frequent determination of prothrombin time and close monitoring of the patient be essential to ascertain when adjustment of dosage of drug1 may be need . 
because of the variability of individual patient response , multiple interact mechanism with some drug , the dependency of the extent of the interaction on the dosage and duration of therapy , and the possible administration of several interact drug simultaneously , it be difficult to predict the direction and degree of the ultimate effect of concomitant medication on drug1 response . 
for example , since drug1 may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of both the oral drug2 and drug3 , the net effect be unpredictable . 
drug1 may cause a increase prothrombin response by displace the drug2 from protein binding site or a diminish prothrombin response through increase metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction , thus lead to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect . 
a interact drug which lead to a decrease in prothrombin time necessitate a increase dose of oral drug1 to maintain a adequate degree of anticoagulation may , if abruptly discontinue , increase the risk of subsequent bleeding .

these reaction have also be report in patient who have discontinue that drug and have be start on a drug1 . 
some case present with feature resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome . 
therefore , it be recommend that drug1 tablet not be use in combination with drug2 , or within 14 day of discontinue treatment with a drug3 . 
after stop drug1 tablet , at least 2 week should be allow before start a drug2 . 
potential drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 interaction 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 be all metabolize by the cytochrome p450iiia4 isozyme , and it have be demonstrate that drug4 , a potent inhibitor of iiia4 , block the metabolism of these drug , result in increase plasma concentration of parent drug . 
increase plasma concentration of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 cause QT prolongation and have be associate with torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia , sometimes fatal . 
as note below , a sub - for drug1 in combination with drug2 , a drug that be know to be metabolize by the iiia4 isozyme . 
although it have not be definitively demonstrate that drug1 be a potent iiia4 inhibitor , it be likely to be , give the substantial interaction of drug2 with drug3 . 
consequently , it be recommend that drug1 not be use in combination with either drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
other potentially important drug interaction : drug1 : drug2 metabolize by hepatic oxidation -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 elc . -rrb- should be use with caution because the clearance of these drug be likely to be reduce by drug6 . 
the clearance of drug1 metabolize by glucuronidation -lrb- e. g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- be unlikely to be affect by drug5 . 
drug1 : when drug2 -lrb- 100 mg qd -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- 1 mg q.d. be co-administer to steady state , plasma concentration and other pharmacokinetic parameter -lrb- auc , cmax , t1/2 , -rrb- of drug4 be approximately twice those observe when drug5 be administer alone ; 
oral clearance be reduce by about 50 % . 
the elevated plasma drug1 concentration result in decrease psychomotor performance and memory . 
this interaction , which have not be investigate use higher dose of drug1 , may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose be co-administered , particularly since drug2 exhibit non-linear pharmacokinetic over the dosage range 100-300 mg . if drug3 be co-administer with drug4 tablet , the initial drug5 dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose be recommend . 
no dosage adjustment be require for drug1 tablet . 
drug1 : the co-administration of drug2 tablet and drug3 be generally not advisable . 
because drug1 reduce the clearance of both drug2 and its active metabolite , drug3 , there be a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic co-administration . 
evidence support the conclusion that it be inadvisable to co-administer drug1 and drug2 be derive from a study in which healthy volunteer take 150 mg/day of drug3 be administer a single oral dose of 10 mg of drug4 . 
in these subject -lrb- r = b -rrb- , the clearance of drug1 be reduce by 65 % and that of drug2 to a level that be too low to measure over the course of the 2 week long study . 
it be likely that experience significantly underestimate the degree of accumulation that might occur with repeal drug1 administration . 
moreover , as note with drug1 , the effect of drug2 may even be more pronounced when it be administer at higher dose . 
accordingly , drug1 and drug2 should not ordinarily be co-administer . 
drug1 : the effect of steady-state drug2 l50 mg bid on the pharmacokinetic of a single dose of drug3 -lrb- 375 mg -rrb- as 442 mg drug4 be evaluate in 12 healthy non-smoking , male volunteer . 
the clearance of drug1 be decrease approximately 3-fold . 
therefore , if drug1 be co-administer with drug2 , its dose should be reduce to one third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentration of drug3 should to monitor . 
no dosage adjustment be require for drug1 tablet . 
drug1 : when drug2 -lrb- 50 mg tid -rrb- be administer concomitantly with drug3 for two week , drug4 plasma concentration increase by 98 % and prothrombin time be prolong . 
thus patient receive oral drug1 and drug2 tablet should have they prothrombin time monitor and they drug3 dose adjust accordingly . 
no dosage adjustment be require for drug1 tablet . 
in occasional susceptible patient or in those receive drug1 -lrb- include antiparkinsonism agent -rrb- in addition , the atropine-like effect may become more pronounced -lrb- e.g. , paralytic ileus -rrb- . 
close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage be require when this drug be administer concomitantly with drug1 . 
avoid the use of preparation such as drug1 and local drug2 which contain any drug3 -lrb- e.g. , drug4 , drug5 -rrb- , since it have be report that drug6 can potentiate the effect of catecholamine . 
caution should be exercise when drug1 be use with agent that lower blood pressure . 
drug1 may potentiate the effect of drug2 . 
the plasma concentration of drug1 may increase when the drug be give concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 -rrb- and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducer -lrb- e.g. , drug4 , drug5 -rrb- , and adjustment of the dosage of drug6 may therefore be necessary . 
drug metabolize by p450 2d6 the biochemical activity of the drug metabolize isozyme cytochrome p450 2d6 -lrb- debrisoquin hydroxylase -rrb- be reduce in a subset of the caucasian population -lrb- about 7 to 10 % of caucasian be so call poor metabolizer -rrb- ; 
reliable estimate of the prevalence of reduce p450 2d6 isozyme activity among asian , african and other population be not yet available . 
Poor metabolizer have higher than expect plasma concentration of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- when give usual dose . 
depend on the fraction of drug metabolize by p450 2d6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large -lrb- 8-fold increase in plasma auc of the drug1 -rrb- . 
in addition , certain drug inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizer resemble p.o. 
metabolizer . 
a individual who be stable on a give dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when give one of these inhibit drug as concomitant therapy . 
the drug that inhibit cytochrome p450 2d6 include some that be not metabolize by the enzyme -lrb- drug1 ; 
drug1 -rrb- and many that be substrate for p450 2d6 -lrb- many other drug2 , drug3 , and the drug4 drug5 and drug6 -rrb- . 
while all the drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , e. g. , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , inhibit p450 2d6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
the extent to which drug1 - drug2 interaction may pose clinical problem will depend on the degree of inhibition , and the pharmacokinetic of the drug3 involve . 
nevertheless , caution be indicate in the co-administration of tca5 with any of the drug1 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiate TCA treatment in a patient be withdraw from drug1 , give the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite -lrb- at least 5 week may be necessary -rrb- . 
concomitant use of drug1 with drug that can inhibit cytochrome p450 2d6 may require lower dose than usually prescribe for either the drug2 or the other drug . 
furthermore , whenever one of these other drug be withdraw from cotherapy , a increase dose of drug1 may be require . 
it be desirable to monitor drug1 plasma level whenever a drug2 be go to be co-administer with another drug know to be a inhibitor of p450 2d6 . 
drug1 , drug2 , metal cation , drug3 drug4 form chelate with alkaline earth and transition metal cation . 
administration of drug1 with drug2 contain drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 , with drug6 , with metal cation such as drug7 , or with drug8 contain drug9 or drug10 , or with formulation contain divalent and trivalent cation such as drug11 -lrb- drug12 -rrb- chewable/buffered tablet or the pediatric powder for oral solution , may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug13 , result in systemic concentration considerably lower than desire . 
these agent should not be take within 4 hour before or 4 hour after drug1 administration . 
drug1 drug2 drug3 , like other drug4 , may inhibit the metabolism of drug5 and drug6 . 
these stimulant be commonly find in coffee and tea , respectively . 
in some patient , this may lead to reduce clearance , prolongation of plasma half-life , and enhance effect of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 : drug2 be a competitive inhibitor of the metabolism of drug3 . 
serum drug1 concentration increase when drug2 be initiate in a patient maintain on drug3 . 
when initiate a multi-day course of drug1 in a patient maintain on drug2 , the drug3 maintenance dose should be halve for the period of concurrent use of drug4 and monitoring of serum drug5 concentration should be initiate as a guide to further dosage adjustment . 
drug1 : in subject receive drug2 , no significant change in clot time be observe when drug3 be coadminister . 
however , because some drug1 have be report to enhance the effect of drug2 or its derivative , prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitor closely if a drug3 be administer with drug4 or its derivative . 
drug metabolize by cytochrome p450 enzyme the drug interaction study evaluate the effect of drug1 on drug2 indicate that drug3 inhibit drug4 metabolism , which be mediate by cyp1a2 . 
while no clinical study have be conduct to evaluate the effect of drug1 on the metabolism of C.P.A. 
substrate , in vitro datum suggest similar effect of drug1 in cyp3a4 mediate metabolism and drug2 metabolism . 
in addition , other drug1 have be report to decrease the cyp3a4-mediated metabolism of drug2 . 
other drug metabolize by C.P.A. 
include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
the clinical relevance of the potential effect of drug1 on the metabolism of C.P.A. substrate be not know . 
patient receive concurrent administration of substrate of C.P.A. be not exclude from clinical trial of drug1 . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- : the concomitant administration of a drug3 with a drug4 may increase the risk of cns stimulation and convulsion . 
drug1 : disturbance of blood glucose , include hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia , have be report in patient treat concomitantly with drug2 and a drug3 . 
therefore , careful monitoring of blood glucose be recommend when these agent be coadminister . 
the absorption of drug1 may be affect by the simultaneous administration of indigestion remedy , drug2 or drug3 supplement . 
oral drug1 may be less effective while you be take drug2 . 
potential drug interaction between drug1 -lrb- drug2 cream -rrb- cream , 1 % , and other drug have not be systematically evaluate . 
drug1 : drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- have be safely coadminister with drug4 . 
drug1 : a study in normal healthy volunteer have show that concomitant administration of drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- and drug4 do not result in altered pharmacoktnetic of either drug . 
in a study in hypertensive patient , addition of drug1 to exist drug2 therapy do not result in any unexpected adverse effect , and drug3 have a additional antihypertensive effect . 
drug1 : in a single dose study in normal volunteer , coadministration of drug2 have a small effect on the rate but no effect on the extent of drug3 bioavailability . 
significant increase in auc -lrb- 27 % -rrb- and cmax -lrb- 58 % -rrb- and decrease in tmax -lrb- 23 % -rrb- of drug1 be note in this study . 
however , concomitant administration of 5 mg b.i.d. drug1 and 40 mg b.i.d. 
drug1 to healthy volunteer under steady-state condition have no relevant effect on either drug s bioavailability , auc and cmax , difference be 20 % between drug2 give singly and in combination with drug3 , and between drug4 give singly and in combination with drug5 . 
drug1 : in a study in healthy volunteer , a one-week course of drug2 at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of drug3 on the sixth day show a increase in drug4 mean peak plasma concentration -lrb- 36 % -rrb- and significant increase in area under the curve -lrb- 50 % -rrb- . 
if drug1 therapy be initiate in a patient currently receive drug2 careful monitoring for adverse reaction be advise and downward dose adjustment may be require . 
drug1 : in a study in healthy volunteer , a six-day course of drug2 at 600 mg/day follow by a single 5 mg dose of drug3 result in a reduction in drug4 level to below detectable limit . 
if drug1 therapy be require , drug2 concentration and therapeutic effect be likely to be markedly reduce or abolish as a consequence of increase metabolism and higher clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 : in a study in healthy volunteer , no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between drug2 and racemic drug3 be see when two single oral dose of drug4 -lrb- 0.7 mg/kg body weight -rrb- be administer during 11 day of multipledose treatment with 5 mg b.i.d. drug5 . 
neither racemic drug1 nor drug2 binding to plasma protein in vitro be alter by the addition of the other drug . 
drug1 : the concomitant administration of drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- and drug4 in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study do not affect renal , nonrenal and total body clearance of drug5 . 
drug1 Anesthesia : severe hypotension have be report during drug2 anesthesia with concomitant use of a drug3 and a drug4 . 
even though such interaction have not be see in clinical study with drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , a increase volume of circulate fluid might be require if such a interaction be to occur . 
in normal volunteer receive drug1 , the administration of drug2 decrease the renal clearance and significantly increase the plasma level of drug3 . 
in some patient , combine use of drug1 and drug2 have be associate with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage . 
therefore , drug1 and drug2 should not be use concomitantly . 
in a study in normal volunteer , it be find that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of drug1 per day decrease drug2 blood level approximately 20 % . 
the concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 be not recommend due to the increase possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity , with little or no increase in efficacy . 
clinical study have show that drug1 do not influence the hypoprothrombinemia produce by drug2 . 
however , when any additional drug , include drug1 , be add to the treatment of patient on drug2 therapy , the patient should be observe for alteration of the prothrombin time . 
in post-marketing experience , bleeding have be report in patient on concomitant treatment with drug1 and drug2 . 
caution should be exercise when drug1 and drug2 be administer concomitantly . 
when drug1 be give to patient receive drug2 , the plasma level of drug3 be likely to be increase . 
therefore , a lower total daily dosage of drug1 may produce a satisfactory therapeutic effect . 
when increase in the dose of drug1 be make , they should be make carefully and in small increment . 
caution should be use if drug1 be administer simultaneously with drug2 . 
drug1 have be report to decrease the tubular secretion of drug2 and to potentiate its toxicity . 
administration of drug1 concomitantly with drug2 have be associate with a increase in drug3 - induce toxicity , possibly due to decrease synthesis of renal prostacyclin . 
drug1 should be use with caution in patient take drug2 , and renal function should be carefully monitor . 
capsule drug1 50 mg t.i.d. produce a clinically relevant elevation of plasma drug2 and reduction in renal drug3 clearance in psychiatric patient and normal subject with steady state plasma drug4 concentration . 
this effect have be attribute to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis . 
as a consequence , when drug1 and drug2 be give concomitantly , the patient should be carefully observe for sign of drug3 toxicity . 
-lrb- read circular for drug1 preparation before use of such concomitant therapy . -rrb- 
in addition , the frequency of monitor serum drug1 concentration should be increase at the outset of such combination drug treatment . 
drug1 give concomitantly with drug2 have be report to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of drug3 . 
therefore , when drug1 and drug2 be use concomitantly , serum drug3 level should be closely monitor . 
in some patient , the administration of drug1 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effect of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
therefore , when drug1 and drug2 . 
-lrb- drug1 -rrb- drug2 be use concomitantly , the patient should be observe closely to determine if the desire effect of the drug3 be obtain . 
drug1 reduce basal plasma renin activity -lrb- PRA -rrb- , as well as those elevation of PRA induce by drug2 administration , or salt or volume depletion . 
these fact should be consider when evaluate plasma renin activity in hypertensive patient . 
it have be report that the addition of drug1 to a maintenance schedule of drug2 result in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteer . 
drug1 and drug2 should not be administer together . 
drug1 and drug2 each may be associate with increase serum potassium level . 
the potential effect of drug1 and drug2 on potassium kinetics and renal function should be consider when these agent be administer concurrently . 
most of the above effect concern drug1 have be attribute , at least in part , to mechanism involve inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by drug2 . 
blunt of the antihypertensive effect of drug1 by drug2 include drug3 have be report . 
therefore , when use these block agent to treat hypertension , patient should be observe carefully in order to confirm that the desire therapeutic effect have be obtain . 
drug1 can reduce the antihypertensive effect of drug2 and drug3 . 
false-negative result in the dexamethasone suppression test -lrb- dst -rrb- in patient be treat with drug1 have be report .

concomitant use of drug1 usually depress drug2 activity and may necessitate raise the dosage . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 have be report to reduce the efficacy of oral drug2 and to increase the incidence of breakthrough bleeding . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 - contain drug3 have not be formally study . 
although drug1 have a lower affinity for drug2 than for drug3 , drug4 should not be take with drug5 - contain drug6 . 
in healthy volunteer , drug1 have no effect on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 . 
the effect of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetic have not be study . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 have not be formally study . 
dose of drug1 up to 200 mg be allow in clinical study without negative consequence . 
the interaction of drug1 with drug2 have not be formally study . 
no inhibition of drug1 metabolism by drug2 be expect base on the result of a in vitro study . 
drug1 should not be combine with other iron chelator therapy , as safety of such combination have not be establish . 
Drug/Food interaction the bioavailability -lrb- auc -rrb- of drug1 be variably increase when take with a meal . 
drug1 should be take on a empty stomach 30 minute before eat . 
drug1 tablet for oral suspension can be disperse in water , orange juice , or apple juice . 
the use of drug1 in patient who be receive drug2 may potentiate renal disease state . 
in vitro study have show that drug1 anion , because of its affinity for protein , may displace from they binding site other drug which be also albumin-bound . 
theoretically , the drug1 anion itself could likewise be displace . 
short-term controlled study fail to show that take the drug significantly affect prothrombin time when administer to individual on drug1 . 
caution be advise nonetheless , since interaction have be see with other nonsteroidal agent of this class . 
similarly , patient receive the drug and a drug1 , drug2 or drug3 should be observe for sign of toxicity to these drug . 
concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 be not recommend because drug3 be displace from its binding site during the concomitant administration of drug4 , result in lower plasma concentration and peak plasma level . 
the natriuretic effect of drug1 have be report to be inhibit by some drug of this class . 
inhibition of renal drug1 clearance lead to increase in plasma drug2 concentration have also be report . 
drug1 and other drug2 can reduce the antihypertensive effect of drug3 and other drug4 . 
drug1 give concurrently increase drug2 anion plasma level and extend its plasma half-life significantly . 
caution should be use if drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 , drug2 and other drug3 have be report to reduce the tubular secretion of drug4 in a animal model , possibly increase the toxicity of drug5 . 
drug/laboratory test interaction drug1 may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time . 
this effect should be keep in mind when bleed time be determine . 
the administration of drug1 may result in increase urinary value for 17-ketogenic steroid because of a interaction between the drug and/or its metabolite with m-dinitrobenzene use in this assay . 
although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurement -lrb- Porter-Silber test -rrb- do not appear to be artifactually alter , it be suggest that therapy with drug1 be temporarily discontinue 72 hour before adrenal function test be perform if the Porter-Silber test be to be use . 
drug1 may interfere with some urinary assay of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid -lrb- 5hiaa -rrb- . 
the concurrent use of two or more drug with anticholinergic activity -- such as a drug1 -lrb- eg , drug2 -rrb- , a drug3 -lrb- eg , drug4 -rrb- , and/or a drug5 -lrb- eg , drug6 -rrb- -- commonly result in excessive anticholinergic effect , include dry mouth and associate dental complication , blur vision , and , in patient expose to high temperature and humidity , hyperpyrexia . 
interaction may also occur with the following : drug1 / drug2 , drug use to treat a overactive thyroid , drug3 -lrb- e.g. , drug4 -rrb- , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 pain medication -lrb- e.g. , drug13 -rrb- , drug use to aid sleep , drowsiness-causing drug14 -lrb- e.g. , drug15 -rrb- , any other drug that may make you drowsy . 
drug interaction . 
drug1 have be administer to patient receive drug2 or drug3 without adverse effect . 
during administration of multiple oral dose of drug1 to healthy subject stabilize on a maintenance dose of drug2 , a 13 % -19 % increase in plasma drug3 level occur at six hour postdose . 
in a study involve healthy subject receive drug1 and drug2 concurrently , plasma drug3 level be increase about 20 % and drug4 level be increase about 30 % compare to control value . 
in this formal interaction study , drug1 and drug2 be each find to have negative inotropic effect ; 
when the drug be administer together , the effect be additive . 
the effect of concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 on the pr interval be less than additive . 
in drug1 clinical trial , patient who be receive drug2 concurrently do not experience a increase incidence of side effect . 
nevertheless , the possibility of additive negative inotropic effect of drug1 and drug2 should be recognize . 
drug1 be not extensively bind to plasma protein . 
in vitro study with several drug which may be administer concomitantly show that the extent of drug1 binding to human plasma protein be either unchanged or only slightly less . 
consequently , interaction with other drug which be highly protein bind -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- would not be expect . 
drug1 have be use in a large number of patient receive drug2 without apparent interaction . 
limited datum in patient receive known enzyme inducer -lrb- drug1 , drug2 , drug3 -rrb- indicate only a 30 % increase in the rate of drug4 elimination . 
in healthy subject receive drug1 -lrb- 1 gm daily -rrb- for one week , plasma drug2 level increase by about 30 % and half-life increase by about 10 % . 
when drug1 be add to drug2 therapy , plasma drug3 level may increase two-fold or more in some patient , if drug4 dosage be not reduce . 
drug that inhibit cytochrome p450iid6 , such as drug1 , might increase the plasma concentration of drug2 in patient that be on chronic drug3 therapy ; 
especially if these patient be extensive metabolizer . 
there have be little experience with the coadministration of drug1 and either drug2 or drug3 . 
because both of these drug have negative inotropic property and the effect of coadministration with drug1 be unknown , neither drug2 nor drug3 should be administer concurrently with drug4 unless , in the judgment of the physician , the benefit of this combination outweigh the risk . 
there have be too little experience with the coadministration of drug1 with drug2 or drug3 to recommend concomitant use . 
drug1 : the effect of a drug2 - and drug3 - contain drug4 -lrb- drug5 -rrb- * on the pharmacokinetic of drug6 be investigate in 12 cancer patient . 
there be a small increase in plasma concentration of drug1 and one metabolite -lrb- drug2 -rrb- ; 
there be no effect on the 3 major metabolite -lrb- drug1 , drug2 and drug3 -rrb- . 
drug1 altered coagulation parameter and/or bleed have be report in patient take drug2 concomitantly with drug3 such as drug4 and drug5 . 
patient take drug1 concomitantly with drug2 should be monitor regularly for alteration in they coagulation parameter -lrb- pt or inr -rrb- . 
drug1 : the concentration of drug2 be increase and its toxicity may be enhance by drug3 . 
death from severe enterocolitis , diarrhea , and dehydration have be report in elderly patient receive weekly drug1 and drug2 . 
cytochrome p450 1a2 -lrb- cyp1a2 -rrb- be know to be the major enzyme involve in the metabolism of drug1 . 
therefore , drug1 have the potential to interact with drug that be substrate for cyp1a2 , inhibit cyp1a2 , or induce cyp1a2 . 
few datum exist on drug interaction with drug1 in preterm neonate . 
base on adult datum , lower dose of drug1 may be need follow coadministration of drug which be report to decrease drug2 elimination -lrb- e.g. , drug3 and drug4 -rrb- and higher drug5 dose may be need follow coadministration of drug that increase drug6 elimination -lrb- e.g. , drug7 and drug8 -rrb- . 
drug1 administer concurrently with drug2 reduce the urine volume in 4 healthy volunteer . 
the clinical significance of this interaction in preterm neonate be not know . 
interconversion between drug1 and drug2 have be report in preterm neonate . 
the concurrent use of these drug be not recommend . 
no drug interaction study have be perform . 
other medicine - although certain medicine should not be use together at all , in other case two different medicine may be use together even if a interaction might occur . 
in these case , you doctor may want to change the dose , or other precaution may be necessary . 
when you be use drug1 , it be especially important that you health care professional know if you be use the following : Eye product contain drug2 . 
drug1 may interact with the drug2 preparation cause a gritty substance to form or may interact with the preservative in the drug3 preparation cause a toxic effect in the eye . 
no well-known drug interaction with drug1 
clinical trial have indicate that drug1 can be effectively and safely use in conjunction with standard cystic fibrosis therapy include oral , inhale and/or parenteral drug2 , drug3 , enzyme supplement , drug4 , oral or inhale drug5 , and drug6 . 
no formal drug interaction study have be perform . 
clinically meaningful drug interaction have occur with concomitant medication and include , but be not limit to the following : agent highly bind to plasma protein drug1 be not highly bind to plasma protein ; 
therefore , administration of drug1 to a patient take another drug that be highly protein bind should not cause increase free concentration of the other drug . 
agent that inhibit cytochrome p450 isoenzyme and/or Epoxide Hydrolase drug1 be metabolize mainly by cytochrome p450 -lrb- cyp -rrb- 3a4 to the active drug2 , which be further metabolize to the trans-diol by epoxide hydrolase . 
therefore , the potential exist for interaction between drug1 and any agent that inhibit cyp3a4 and/or epoxide hydrolase . 
agent that be cyp3a4 inhibitor that have be find , or be expect , to increase plasma level of drug1 be the following : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 -lrb- 1 -rrb- , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 -lrb- 1 -rrb- , drug11 , drug12 , grapefruit juice , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 , drug23 , drug24 , drug25 -lrb- 1 -rrb- , drug26 , drug27 . 
thus , if a patient have be titrate to a stable dosage of drug1 , and then begin a course of treatment with one of these cyp3a4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitor , it be reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for drug2 may be necessary . 
agent that induce cytochrome p450 isoenzyme drug1 be metabolize by cyp3a4 . 
therefore , the potential exist for interaction between drug1 and any agent that induce cyp3a4 . 
agent that be CYP inducer that have be find , or be expect , to decrease plasma level of drug1 be the following : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 -lrb- 2 -rrb- , drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 thus , if a patient have be titrate to a stable dosage on drug11 , and then begin a course of treatment with one of these cyp3a4 inducer , it be reasonable to expect that a dose increase for drug12 may be necessary . 
agent with decrease level in the presence of drug1 due to induction of cytochrome p450 enzyme drug2 be know to induce cyp1a2 and cyp3a4 . 
therefore , the potential exist for interaction between drug1 and any agent metabolize by one -lrb- or more -rrb- of these enzyme . 
agent that have be find , or be expect to have decrease plasma level in the presence of drug1 due to induction of cyp enzyme be the following : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 , drug23 , drug24 , drug25 , drug26 , drug27 , drug28 , drug29 , drug30 , oral drug31 -lrb- 3 -rrb- , drug32 , drug33 -lrb- 4 -rrb- , drug34 , drug35 , drug36 , drug37 , drug38 , drug39 , drug40 , drug41 , drug42 , drug43 , drug44 -lrb- 5 -rrb- , drug45 , and drug46 . 
thus , if a patient have be titrate to a stable dosage on one of the agent in this category , and then begin a course of treatment with drug1 , it be reasonable to expect that a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary . 
agent with increase level in the presence of drug1 : drug2 increase the plasma level of the follow agent : drug3 , drug4 -lrb- 6 -rrb- , and drug5 thus , if a patient have be titrate to a stable dosage on one of the agent in this category , and then begin a course of the treatment with drug6 , it be reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary . 
pharmacological/pharmacodynamic interaction with drug1 concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effect . 
give the anticonvulsant property of drug1 , drug2 may reduce the thyroid function as have be report with other drug3 . 
additionally , drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , may antagonize the activity of drug4 . 
thus if a patient have be titrate to a stable dosage on one of the agent in this category , and then begin a course of treatment with drug1 , it be reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary . 
because of its primary cns effect , caution should be use when drug1 be take with other drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 - drug2 may counteract the antinaturetic effect of drug3 . 
drug1 - drug2 may increase the absorption of drug3 if take concomitantly . 
Organic drug1 - drug2 supplement theoretically may potentiate the effect of organic drug3 if take concomitantly . 
drug1 - theoretically , drug2 supplement take concomitantly with drug3 , may potentiate the effect of the drug . 
drug1 may decrease drug2 response to drug3 . 
drug1 be a inhibitor of the cytochrome p450 isoform cyp3a4 . 
coadministration of drug1 and drug primarily metabolize by cyp3a4 may result in increase plasma concentration of the other drug , which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effect . 
drug1 be metabolize by cyp3a4 . 
drug that induce cyp3a4 activity would be expect to increase the clearance of drug1 , result in lowered plasma concentration of drug2 . 
coadministration of drug1 and other drug that inhibit cyp3a4 may decrease the clearance of drug2 and may result in increase plasma concentration of drug3 .

interaction for drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -rrb- : drug6 : drug7 have be report to reduce intestinal absorption of drug8 ; 
as such it may impair intestinal absorption of any of drug1 . 
drug1 / drug2 : the coadministration of drug3 or drug4 will not affect plasma concentration of drug5 , but may reduce endogenous plasma level of drug6 / ergocalcitriol by accelerate metabolism . 
since blood level of drug1 / ergocalcitriol will be reduce , higher dose of drug2 may be necessary if these drug be administer simultaneously . 
drug1 : drug2 be know to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of calcium excretion in urine . 
some report have show that the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 cause hypercalcemia . 
therefore , precaution should be take when coadministration be necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 dosage must be determine with care in patient undergo treatment with drug3 , as hypercalcemia in such patient may precipitate cardiac arrhythmia . 
drug1 : drug2 may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzyme of drug3 . 
reduction in serum endogenous vitamin d concentration have be observe follow the administration of 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day drug1 for a week to healthy man . 
however , in vivo drug interaction study of drug1 with drug2 have not be investigate . 
drug1 : a relationship of functional antagonism exist between drug2 , which promote calcium absorption , and drug3 , which inhibit calcium absorption . 
phosphate-binding agent : since drug1 also have a effect on phosphate transport in the intestine , kidney and bone , the dosage of phosphate-binding agent must be adjust in accordance with the serum phosphate concentration . 
drug1 : the coadministration of any of the drug2 should be avoid as this could create possible additive effect and hypercalcemia . 
drug1 supplement : uncontrolled intake of additional drug2 - contain preparation should be avoid . 
drug1 : drug2 - contain preparation -lrb- eg , drug3 -rrb- may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be take during therapy with drug4 by patient on chronic renal dialysis . 
drug metabolize by p450 2d6 - the biochemical activity of the drug metabolize isozyme cytochrome p450 2d6 -lrb- debrisoquin hydroxylase -rrb- be reduce in a subset of the caucasian population -lrb- about 7-10 % of caucasian be so call poor metabolizer -rrb- ; 
reliable estimate of the prevalence of reduce p450 2d6 isozyme activity among asian , african and other population be not yet available . 
Poor metabolizer have higher than expect plasma concentration of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- when give usual dose . 
depend on the fraction of drug metabolize by p450 2d6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large -lrb- 8-fold increase in plasma auc of the drug1 -rrb- . 
in addition , certain drug inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizer resemble poor metabolizer . 
a individual who be stable on a give dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when give one of these inhibit drug as concomitant therapy . 
the drug that inhibit cytochrome p450 2d6 include some that be not metabolize by the enzyme -lrb- drug1 ; 
drug1 -rrb- and many that be substrate for p450 2d6 -lrb- many other drug2 , drug3 , and the drug4 drug5 and drug6 -rrb- . 
while all the selective drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , inhibit p450 2d6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
the extent to which drug1 - drug2 interaction may pose clinical problem will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetic of the drug3 involve . 
nevertheless , caution be indicate in the coadministration of drug1 with any of the drug2 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiate TCA treatment in a patient be withdraw from drug1 , give the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite -lrb- at least 5 week may be necessary -rrb- . 
concomitant use of drug1 with drug that can inhibit cytochrome p450 2d6 may require lower dose than usually prescribe for either the drug2 or the other drug . 
furthermore , whenever one of these other drug be withdraw from co-therapy , a increase dose of drug1 may be require .

drug1 , drug2 , drug3 -lrb- drug4 , drug5 , drug6 : skeletal muscle . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- : drug3 plasma concentration be not affect by co-administration of drug4 . 
drug1 : drug2 plasma concentration be not affect by co-administration of drug3 . 
drug1 : the influence of the bile-acidsequestering agent drug2 on the pharmacokinetit of drug3 be evaluate in 12 healthy male in 2 separate randomized crossover study . 
in the first study , concomitant administration of 0.2 mg drug1 and 12 g drug2 result in decrease of more than 22 % for auc and 40 % for Cmax when compare to dosing drug3 alone . 
however , in the second study , administration of 12 g drug1 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg drug2 approximately 4 hour after the same evening meal result in a decrease in the drug3 auc of less than 8 % , and a decrease in cmax of about 30 % when compare to dosing drug4 alone . 
therefore , it would be expect that a dosing schedule of drug1 give at bedtime and drug2 give before the evening meal would not result in a significant decrease in the clinical effect of drug3 . 
drug1 : plasma drug2 level and drug3 clearance at steady-state be not affect by co-administration of 0.2 mg drug4 . 
drug1 plasma concentration be also not affect by co-administration of drug2 . 
drug1 : Co - administration of drug2 and drug3 to healthy volunteer do not result in any change in prothrombin time or clotting factor vii when compare to co-administration of drug4 and placebo . 
the auc and cmax of both the -lrb- r -rrb- and -lrb- s -rrb- isomer of drug1 be unaffected by concurrent dosing of 0.3 mg drug2 . 
co-administration of drug1 and drug2 do not alter the pharmacokinetic of drug3 . 
drug1 : in hypercholesterolemic patient , steady-state drug2 auc and cmax increase approximately 50 % and 24 % respectively after 10 day with co-administration of drug3 , a known inhibitor of cytochrome p450 3a4 . 
other concomitant therapy : although specific interaction study be not perform , in clinical study , drug1 be use concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 -lrb- drug7 -rrb- without evidence of clinically significant adverse interaction . 
additive adverse effect result from cholinergic blockade may occur when drug1 be administer concomitantly with other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 or some drug8 . 
drug1 may interfere with the absorption of drug2 . 
administer drug1 before meal ; 
drug1 after meal . 
drug1 be metabolize to drug2 by the cytochrome p450 -lrb- cyp450 -rrb- enzyme group , specifically cytochrome p450 3a4 -lrb- cyp3a4 -rrb- and cyp2c8 . 
the cyp3a4 isoenzyme be present in both the liver and intestine . 
drug1 be also know to be a inhibitor of cyp3a4 . 
therefore , drug1 have the potential for interaction with drug or substance that may be substrate , inhibitor or inducer of cyp3a4 . 
while only a limited number of in vivo drug-drug interaction with drug1 have be report , chiefly with the oral formulation , the potential for other interaction should be anticipate . 
this be especially important for drug associate with serious toxicity , such as other drug1 . 
if such drug be need , they dose should be reassess and , where appropriate , plasma concentration measure . 
in view of the long and variable half-life of drug1 , potential for drug interaction exist not only with concomitant medication but also with drug administer after discontinuation of drug2 . 
since drug1 be a substrate for cyp3a4 and cyp2c8 , drugs/substances that inhibit these isoenzyme may decrease the metabolism and increase serum concentration of drug2 . 
report example include the following : drug1 : drug2 be know to inhibit cyp3a4 to vary degree . 
a case report of one patient take drug1 200 mg and drug2 800 mg three time a day result in increase in drug3 concentration from 0.9 mg/l to 1.3 mg/l . 
DEA concentration be not affect . 
there be no evidence of toxicity . 
monitor for drug1 toxicity and serial measurement of drug2 serum concentration during concomitant drug3 therapy should be consider . 
drug1 : drug2 inhibit cyp3a4 and can increase serum drug3 level . 
other substance : grapefruit juice give to healthy volunteer increase drug1 auc by 50 % and cmax by 84 % , result in increase plasma level of drug2 . 
grapefruit juice should not be take during treatment with oral amiodarone . 
this information should be consider when change from intravenous drug1 to oral drug2 . 
drug1 may suppress certain cyp450 enzyme , include drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
this inhibition can result in unexpectedly high plasma level of other drug1 which be metabolize by those cyp450 enzyme . 
report example of this interaction include the following : drug1 s : drug2 -lrb- drug3 substrate -rrb- administer in combination with oral drug4 have be report to produce persistently elevated plasma concentration of drug5 result in elevated creatinine , despite reduction in dose of drug6 . 
drug1 : drug2 -lrb- drug3 substrate -rrb- in combination with drug4 have be associate with report of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis .

drug1 take concomitantly with drug2 increase the serum drug3 concentration by 70 % after one day . 
on administration of oral drug1 , the need for drug2 therapy should be review and the dose reduce by approximately 50 % or discontinue . 
if drug1 treatment be continue , serum level should be closely monitor and patient observe for clinical evidence of toxicity . 
these precaution probably should apply to drug1 administration as well . 
drug1 : other drug2 drug , such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 , have be use concurrently with drug7 . 
there have be case report of increase steady-state level of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 during concomitant therapy with drug4 .

drug1 and procainamide dose should be reduce by one-third when either be administer with drug2 . 
plasma level of drug1 have be report to increase in the presence of oral drug2 ; 
because of this , the dosage of drug1 should be adjust when these drug2 be administer concomitantly . 
in general , any add drug1 should be initiate at a lower than usual dose with careful monitoring . 
combination of drug1 with other drug2 therapy should be reserve for patient with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia who be incompletely responsive to a single agent or incompletely responsive to drug3 . 
during transfer to oral drug1 , the dose level of previously administer agent should be reduce by 30 to 50 % several day after the addition of oral drug2 . 
the continued need for the other drug1 agent should be review after the effect of drug2 have be establish , and discontinuation ordinarily should be attempt . 
if the treatment be continue , these patient should be particularly carefully monitor for adverse effect , especially conduction disturbance and exacerbation of tachyarrhythmia , as drug1 be continue . 
in drug1 - treated patient who require additional drug2 therapy , the initial dose of such agent should be approximately half of the usual recommend dose . 
drug1 : drug2 should be use with caution in patient receive - drug3 block agent -lrb- e.g. , drug4 , a drug5 inhibitor -rrb- or drug6 antagonist -lrb- e.g. , drug7 , a drug8 substrate , and drug9 , a drug10 inhibitor -rrb- because of the possible potentiation of bradycardia , sinus arrest , and av block ; 
if necessary , drug1 can continue to be use after insertion of a pacemaker in patient with severe bradycardia or sinus arrest . 
drug1 : potentiation of drug2 - type -lrb- drug3 and drug4 substrate -rrb- drug5 response be almost always see in patient receive drug6 and can result in serious or fatal bleeding . 
since the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 increase the prothrombin time by 100 % after 3 to 4 day , the dose of the drug3 should be reduce by one-third to one-half , and prothrombin time should be monitor closely . 
some drug1 / substance be know to accelerate the metabolism of drug2 by stimulate the synthesis of drug3 -lrb- enzyme induction -rrb- . 
this may lead to low drug1 serum level and potential decrease in efficacy . 
report example of this interaction include the following : drug1 : drug2 be a potent inducer of drug3 . 
administration of drug1 concomitantly with oral drug2 have be show to result in decrease in serum concentration of drug3 and drug4 . 
other substance , include herbal preparation : St. John be Wort -lrb- Hypericum perforatum -rrb- induce cyp3a4 . 
since drug1 be a substrate for drug2 , there be the potential that the use of St. John be Wort in patient receive drug3 could result in reduce drug4 level . 
other report interaction with drug1 : drug2 -lrb- drug3 substrate -rrb- in combination with drug4 may cause hypotension , bradycardia , and decrease cardiac output .

volatile drug1 agent : . 
in addition to the interaction note above , chronic -lrb- 2 week -rrb- oral drug1 administration impair metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
Electrolyte Disturbances Patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should have the condition correct whenever possible before be treat with drug1 , as these disorder can exaggerate the degree of qtc prolongation and increase the potential for tdp . 
special attention should be give to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patient experience severe or prolonged diarrhea or in patient receive concomitant drug1 . 
concomitant oral administration of drug1 -lrb- a known inhibitor of cyp3a4 activity in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa -rrb- cause a eight-fold increase of the systemic exposure to oral drug2 . 
if treatment with inhibitor of cyp3a4 activity -lrb- such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , etc. -rrb- be indicate , reduction of the drug7 dose should be consider . 
after extensive intake of grapefruit juice -lrb- which inhibit cyp3a4 activity predominantly in the intestinal mucosa -rrb- , the systemic exposure for oral drug1 increase about two time . 
as with other drug primarily be metabolize through cyp3a4 , ingestion of grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoid in connection with drug1 administration .

no case of rhabdomyolysis be report in this trial . 
no drug interaction study be perform . 
no in vitro metabolism study be perform . 
both drug1 and its major metabolite , drug2 , be inhibitor of the cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme system . 
coadministration of drug1 and drug primarily metabolize by the cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme system may result in increase plasma concentration of the drug that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effect . 
therefore , unless otherwise specify , appropriate dosage adjustment may be necessary . 
coadministration of drug1 with drug2 have lead to elevated plasma concentration of drug3 , result in rare instance of life - threaten cardiac dysrhythmia and one death . 
another oral drug1 , drug2 , inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , result in elevated plasma concentration of drug4 and its active metabolite drug5 which may prolong QT interval . 
in vitro datum suggest that drug1 , when compare to drug2 , have a less pronounced effect on the biotransformation system responsible for the metabolism of drug3 . 
base on the chemical resemblance of drug1 and drug2 , coadministration of drug3 with drug4 be contraindicate . 
human pharmacokinetic datum indicate that oral drug1 potently inhibit the metabolism of drug2 result in a eight-fold increase in the mean auc of drug3 . 
datum suggest that coadministration of oral drug1 and drug2 can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ecg . 
in vitro datum suggest that drug1 also markedly inhibit the biotransformation system mainly responsible for the metabolism of drug2 ; 
therefore concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 be contraindicate . 
coadministration of drug1 with oral drug2 or drug3 have result in elevated plasma concentration of the latter two drug . 
this may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effect . 
these agent should not be use in patient treat with drug1 . 
if drug1 be administer parenterally , special precaution be require since the sedative effect may be prolong . 
coadministration of drug1 and drug2 , drug3 or drug4 have lead to increase plasma concentration of the latter three drug .

however , the total amount of drug1 in the plasma be unchanged . 
hypotension patient on drug1 therapy : patient on drug2 and especially those in whom drug3 therapy be recently institute , as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis , may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receive the initial dose of drug4 . 
the possibility of hypotensive effect with drug1 can be minimize by either discontinue the drug2 or increase the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiation of treatment with drug3 -lrb- drug4 tablet , usp -rrb- or initiate therapy with small dose -lrb- 6.25 or 12.5 mg -rrb- . 
alternatively , provide medical supervision for at least one hour after the initial dose . 
if hypotension occur , the patient should be place in a supine position and , if necessary , receive a intravenous infusion of normal saline . 
this transient hypotensive response be not a contraindication to further dose which can be give without difficulty once the blood pressure have increase after volume expansion . 
agent have vasodilator activity : datum on the effect of concomitant use of other drug1 in patient receive drug2 for heart failure be not available ; 
therefore , drug1 or other drug2 -lrb- as use for management of angina -rrb- or other drug have vasodilator activity should , if possible , be discontinue before start drug3 . 
if resume during drug1 therapy , such agent should be administer cautiously , and perhaps at lower dosage . 
agent cause Renin Release drug1 's effect will be augment by drug2 that cause renin release . 
for example , drug1 -lrb- e.g. , drug2 -rrb- may activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . 
agent affect sympathetic activity the sympathetic nervous system may be especially important in support blood pressure in patient receive drug1 alone or with drug2 . 
therefore , agent affect sympathetic activity -lrb- e.g. , drug1 or drug2 -rrb- should be use with caution . 
drug1 add some further antihypertensive effect to drug2 , but the overall response be less than additive . 
agent increase serum potassium since drug1 decrease aldosterone production , elevation of serum potassium may occur .

drug/laboratory test interaction drug1 may cause a false-positive urine test for acetone . 
drug1 : patient on drug2 , especially those with intravascular volume depletion , may occasionally experience a excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug3 . 
the possibility of hypotensive effect can be minimize by either discontinue the drug1 or increase salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug2 . 
if this be not possible , the start dose should be reduce and the patient should be observe closely for several hour follow a initial dose and until blood pressure have stabilize -lrb- see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION . -rrb- 
drug1 supplement and drug2 : drug3 can attenuate potassium loss cause by drug4 . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and other -rrb- or drug5 supplement can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . 
therefore , if concomitant use of such agent be indicate , they should be give with caution , and the patient serum potassium should be monitor frequently . 
drug1 : increase serum drug2 level and symptom of drug3 toxicity have be report in patient receive drug4 during therapy with drug5 . 
these drug should be coadminister with caution , and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 level be recommend . 
if a drug1 be also use , the risk of lithium toxicity may be increase . 
drug1 : in a clinical pharmacology study , coadministration of a drug2 -lrb- drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -rrb- with drug6 reduce serum level and urinary excretion of drug7 as compare with drug8 administer alone , suggest that drug9 may impair absorption of drug10 . 
therefore , if concomitant administration of these agent be indicate , dosing should be separate by 2 hour . 
other : neither drug1 nor its metabolite have be find to interact with food . 
in separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction study with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , and drug9 , the bioavailability of drug10 be not alter by coadministration of drug11 with any one of these drug .

use with other agent affect Myelopoesis : drug which may affect leukocyte production , include drug1 , may lead to exaggerated leukopenia , especially in renal transplant recipient . 
use with drug1 : the use of drug2 to control hypertension in patient on drug3 have be report to induce severe leukopenia . 
interaction with drug1 other than drug2 have not be specifically study ; 
however , no deleterious interaction be see when drug1 be administer after drug2 , inhalational drug3 , drug4 and muscle relaxant antagonist administer in conjunction with sedation or anesthesia . 
particular caution be necessary when use drug1 in case of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effect -lrb- such as convulsion and cardiac dysrhythmia -rrb- of other drug take in overdose -lrb- especially drug2 -rrb- may emerge with the reversal of the drug3 effect by drug4 . 
the use of drug1 be not recommend in epileptic patient who have be receive benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period . 
although drug1 exert a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect , its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a drug2 agonist can give rise to convulsion in epileptic patient . 
drug1 block the central effect of drug2 by competitive interaction at the receptor level . 
the effect of nonbenzodiazepine agonist at benzodiazepine receptor , such as drug1 , triazolopyridazine and other , be also block by drug2 . 
the pharmacokinetic of drug1 be unaltered in the presence of drug2 and vice versa . 
there be no pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
use in ambulatory patient the effect of drug1 may wear off before a drug2 be completely clear from the body . 
in general , if a patient show no sign of sedation within 2 hour after a 1-mg dose of drug1 , serious resedation at a later time be unlikely . 
a adequate period of observation must be provide for any patient in whom either drug1 -lrb- such as drug2 -rrb- or large dose of drug3 -lrb- such as 10 mg of drug4 -rrb- have be use . 
because of the increase risk of adverse reaction in patient who have be take drug1 on a regular basis , it be particularly important that physician query patient or they guardian carefully about drug2 , drug3 and drug4 use as part of the history prior to any procedure in which the use of drug5 be plan .

both group of agent lower blood level and efficacy of drug1 . 
drug1 : drug2 be inhibit by drug3 . 
alkalinizing agent : gastrointestinal alkalinizing agent -lrb- drug1 , etc. -rrb- increase absorption of drug2 . 
urinary alkalinizing agent -lrb- drug1 , some drug2 -rrb- increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the drug3 molecule , thereby decrease urinary excretion . 
both group of agent increase blood level and therefore potentiate the action of drug1 . 
drug1 , drug2 : drug3 may enhance the activity of drug4 or drug5 ; 
drug1 with drug2 or drug3 and possibly other drug4 cause striking and sustained increase in the concentration of drug5 in the brain ; 
cardiovascular effect can be potentiate . 
drug1 : drug2 , as well as a metabolite of drug3 , slow drug4 metabolism . 
this slow potentiate drug1 , increase they effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamine from adrenergic nerve ending ; 
this can cause headache and other sign of hypertensive crisis . 
a variety of neurological toxic effect and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur , sometimes with fatal result . 
drug1 : drug2 may counteract the sedative effect of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 may antagonize the hypotensive effect of drug3 .

co-administration of drug1 may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action . 
drug1 : drug2 may delay intestinal absorption of drug3 ; 
co-administration of drug1 may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action . 
drug1 : in case of drug2 overdosage , drug3 cns stimulation be potentiated and fatal convulsion can occur . 
drug1 : drug2 inhibit the hypotensive effect of drug3 . 
drug/laboratory test interaction : drug1 can cause a significant elevation in plasma drug2 level . 
this increase be greatest in the evening . 
drug1 may interfere with urinary steroid determination . 
drug1 be metabolize mainly via the cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme . 
in some case where serious ventricular arrhythmia , qt prolongation , and torsade de pointe have occur when drug1 be take in conjunction with one of the cytochrome p450 3a4 inhibitor , elevated blood drug2 level be note at the time of the QT prolongation . 
drug1 : in vitro and/or in vivo datum show that drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug5 , which can result in a increase in plasma drug6 level and prolongation of the QT interval on the ecg . 
drug1 : concurrent administration of certain drug2 , such as drug3 and drug4 , would be expect to compromise the beneficial effect of drug5 . 
drug1 -lrb- oral -rrb- : in patient receive oral drug2 , the coagulation time be increase in some case . 
it be advisable to check coagulation time within the first few day after the start and discontinuation of drug1 therapy , with a appropriate adjustment of the drug2 dose , if necessary . 
drug1 : in vitro datum indicate that drug2 inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , which can result in a increase in plasma drug4 level and prolongation of the QT interval on the ecg . 
drug1 : in vitro and/or in vivo datum indicate that drug2 , drug3 , and oral drug4 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug5 , which can result in a increase in plasma drug6 level and prolongation of the QT interval on the ecg . 
human pharmacokinetic datum indicate that oral drug1 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug2 , result in a mean eight-fold increase in auc of drug3 . 
a study in 14 normal male and female volunteer suggest that coadministration of drug1 and drug2 can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ecg . 
drug1 : drug2 coadministration lead to a increase peak plasma concentration and auc of drug3 , there be no effect on drug4 absorption when it be coadminister with drug5 . 
the gastrointestinal absorption of drug1 and drug2 be accelerate when they be coadminister with drug3 . 
drug1 : in vitro datum indicate that drug2 and drug3 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug4 which can result in a increase in plasma drug5 level and prolongation of the QT interval on the ecg . 
other : coadministration of grapefruit juice with drug1 increase the bioavailability of drug2 and concomitant use should be avoid . 
drug1 should not be use concomitantly with other drug know to prolong the QT interval : certain drug2 , include those of Class IA -lrb- such as drug3 and drug4 -rrb- and class iii -lrb- such as drug5 -rrb- ; 
drug1 -lrb- such as drug2 -rrb- ; 
certain drug1 -lrb- such as drug2 -rrb- ; 
certain drug1 -lrb- such as drug2 -rrb- ; 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
the precede list of drug be not comprehensive . 
the acceleration of gastric emptying by drug1 could affect the rate of absorption of other drug . 
patient receive narrow therapeutic ratio drug or other drug that require careful titration should be follow closely ; 
if plasma level be be monitor , they should be reassess . 
the risk of use drug1 in combination with other drug have not be systematically evaluate . 
give the primary cns effect of drug1 , caution be advise in use it concomitantly with other cns-active drug . 
drug1 should not be use with drug2 . 
close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage be require when drug1 be administer with drug2 or drug3 . 
several drug1 have be report to block the pharmacologic effect of drug2 , drug3 , or similar agent , and such a effect may be anticipate with drug4 because of its structural similarity to other drug5 . 
the plasma concentration of drug1 have be report to be increase by the concomitant administration of drug2 ; 
plasma level of several closely related drug1 have be report to be increase by the concomitant administration of drug2 or hepatic enzyme inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- and decrease by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducer -lrb- e.g. , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- , and such a effect may be anticipate with drug7 as well . 
administration of drug1 have be report to increase the plasma level of drug2 , if give concomitantly . 
drug metabolize by p450 2d6 : the biochemical activity of the drug metabolize isozyme cytochrome p450 2d6 -lrb- debrisoquin hydroxylase -rrb- be reduce in a subset of the aucasian population -lrb- about 7 % -10 % of Caucasians be so-called poor metabolizer -rrb- ; 
reliable estimate of the prevalence of reduce p450 2d6 isozyme activity among asian , african and other population be not yet available . 
Poor metabolizer have higher than expect lasma concentration of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- when give usual dose . 
depend on the fraction of drug metabolize by p450 2d6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large -lrb- 8 fold increase in plasma auc of the drug1 -rrb- . 
in addition , certain drug inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizer resemble poor metabolizer . 
a individual who be stable on a give dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when give one of these inhibit drug as concomitant therapy . 
the drug that inhibit cytochrome p450 2d6 include some that be not metabolize by the enzyme -lrb- drug1 ; 
drug1 -rrb- and many that be substrate for p450 2d6 -lrb- many other drug2 , drug3 , and the drug4 drug5 and drug6 -rrb- . 
while all the drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 , inhibit p450 2d6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
drug1 have also be show to inhibit p450 1a2 , a isoform also involve in drug2 metabolism . 
the extent to which drug1 - drug2 interaction may pose clinical problem will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetic of the drug3 involve . 
nevertheless , caution be indicate in the co-administration of drug1 with any of the drug2 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiate drug1 treatment in a patient be withdraw from drug2 , give the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite -lrb- at least 5 week may be necessary -rrb- . 
concomitant use of agent in the drug1 -lrb- which include drug2 -rrb- with drug that can inhibit cytochrome p450 2d6 may require lower dose than usually prescribe for either the drug3 or the other drug . 
furthermore , whenever one of these drug be withdraw from co-therapy , a increase dose of drug1 may be require . 
it be desirable to monitor drug1 plasma level whenever a agent of the drug2 include drug3 be go to be co-administer with another drug know to be a inhibitor of p450 2d6 -lrb- and/or p450 1a2 -rrb- . 
because drug1 be highly bind to serum protein , the administration of drug2 to patient take other drug that be highly bind to protein -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- may cause a increase in plasma concentration of these drug , potentially result in adverse effect . 
conversely , adverse effect may result from displacement of protein-bound drug1 by other highly bind drug . 
no trial specifically examine potential drug interaction with drug1 be conduct , although many concomitant drug be use in clinical trial . 
no drug interaction be detect except for a increase in symptomatic hypotension in patient receive oral drug1 . 
the co-administration of drug1 with iv drug2 such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or iv drug6 have not be evaluate -lrb- these drug be not co-administer with drug7 in clinical trial -rrb- . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 or other drug3 , cause increase sedative effect . 
it may also interact with drug1 or other drug2 or drug3 , which may intensify the anticholinergic action . 
drug1 can interact with drug2 , increase the metabolism of drug3 . 
additional reduction in blood pressure may occur when drug1 be administer with drug2 , drug3 , or other drug4 . 
when other drug1 or drug2 be use concomitantly , there be the potential for drug3 to increase the risk of bleeding . 
however , patient receive infusion of drug1 in clinical trial be maintain on drug2 without evidence of increase bleeding . 
in clinical trial , drug1 be use with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , oral drug5 , and supplemental drug6 . in a pharmacokinetic substudy in patient with congestive heart failure receive drug7 or drug8 in whom therapy with drug9 be initiate , apparent oral clearance value for drug10 -lrb- n = 23 -rrb- and drug11 -lrb- n = 30 -rrb- be decrease by 13 % and 15 % , respectively , on the second day of therapy and have return to baseline value by day 87 . 
the change in drug1 clearance value be not likely to be clinically significant . 
however , patient on drug1 may show elevation of drug2 concentration after initiation of therapy with drug3 , which may be clinically significant in patient prone to drug4 toxicity . 
specific drug interaction study have not be conduct with drug1 . 
however , the systemic administration of some drug1 have be show to elevate plasma concentration of drug2 , interfere with the metabolism of drug3 , and enhance the effect of the oral drug4 drug5 and its derivative , and have be associate with transient elevation in serum creatinine in patient receive systemic drug6 concomitantly . 
no drug , nutritional supplement , food or herb interaction be know . 
before use this medication , tell you doctor or pharmacist of all prescription and nonprescription product you may use , especially of : drug1 -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 -rrb- , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 drug -lrb- e.g. , drug7 -rrb- , drug8 , drug9 . 
do not start or stop any medicine without doctor or pharmacist approval . 
the hypoglycemic action of drug1 may be potentiate by certain drug include drug2 and other drug that be highly protein bind , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , and drug9 . 
when such drug be administer to a patient receive drug1 , the patient should be observe closely for hypoglycemia . 
when such drug be withdraw from a patient receive drug1 , the patient should be observe closely for loss of control . 
certain drug tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control . 
these drug include the drug1 and other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , thyroid product , drug5 , oral drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 . 
when such drug be administer to a patient receive drug1 , the patient should be closely observe for loss of control . 
when such drug be withdraw from a patient receive drug1 , the patient should be observe closely for hypoglycemia . 
since animal study suggest that the action of drug1 may be prolong by therapy with drug2 , drug3 should be employ with caution . 
in some patient , a drug1 - like reaction may be produce by the ingestion of drug2 . 
a potential interaction between oral drug1 and oral drug2 lead to severe hypoglycemia have be report . 
whether this interaction also occur with the intravenous , topical , or vaginal preparation of drug1 be not know . 
concurrent use of drug1 with drug2 -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 -rrb- may result in increase drug7 effect . 
when use concurrently with such drug , the dose of drug1 should be the smallest effective dose and the frequency of dosing reduce as much as possible when administer concomitantly with drug that potentiate the action of drug2 . 
in healthy volunteer , the pharmacokinetic of a 1-mg dose of drug1 administer as drug2 be not affect by the coadministration of a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose of drug3 . 
however , in another study in healthy volunteer , the pharmacokinetic of drug1 be significantly altered -lrb- 29 % decrease in auc and 38 % decrease in cmax -rrb- when a 1-mg dose of drug2 be administer 1 minute after a 20-mg dose of drug3 nasal spray . 
-lrb- the two drug be administer in opposite nostril . -rrb- 
when the drug1 be administer 30 minute after the drug2 nasal spray , the auc of drug3 increase 11 % and cmax decrease 18 % . 
in neither case be the pharmacokinetic of drug1 affect by coadministration with drug2 . 
these result suggest that the analgesic effect of drug1 may be diminish when it be administer shortly after drug2 nasal spray , but by 30 minute any such reduction in effect should be minimal . 
the safety of use drug1 and drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- nasal spray during the same episode of migraine have not be establish . 
however , it should be note that both product be capable of produce transient increase in blood pressure . 
the pharmacokinetic of a 1-mg dose of drug1 administer as drug2 be not affect by the coadministration of drug3 -lrb- 300 mg qid -rrb- . 
conversely , the administration of drug1 -lrb- 1 mg drug2 qid -rrb- do not alter the pharmacokinetic of a 300-mg dose of drug3 . 
it be not know if the effect of drug1 be alter by concomitant medication that affect hepatic metabolism of drug -lrb- drug2 , etc. -rrb- , but physician should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer interval between dose may be need . 
the fraction of drug1 absorb be unaffected by the concomitant administration of a drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , but the rate of absorption be decrease . 
therefore , a slower onset can be anticipate if drug1 be administer concomitantly with , or immediately follow , a drug2 . 
no information be available about the use of drug1 concurrently with drug2 . 
drug1 should be use cautiously in patient with hyperthyroidism , hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia . 
all drug1 should be use cautiously in patient take drug2 . 
drug1 should not be administer concomitantly with other drug2 -lrb- such as drug3 -rrb- because of possible additive effect and increase toxicity . 
combined effect may induce serious cardiac arrhythmia . 
they may be administer alternately when the preceding effect of other such drug have subside . 
administration of drug1 to patient receive drug2 or drug3 such as drug4 which sensitize the myocardium , may induce cardiac arrhythmia . . 
when encounter , such arrhythmia may respond to administration of a drug1 . 
drug1 also should be use cautiously with other drug -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 -rrb- that sensitize the myocardium to the action of drug4 . 
drug1 may decrease vascular response to pressor drug such as drug2 . 
drug1 may antagonize the neuron blockade produce by drug2 result in decrease antihypertensive effect and require increase dosage of the latter . 
May interact drug1 -lrb- altered hypo-prothrombinemic effect -rrb- , drug2 , drug3 and other inducer of hepatic microsomal enzyme oxidation system -lrb- decrease effect of drug4 -rrb- , drug5 -lrb- increase effect of drug6 -rrb- . 
drug1 : concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 be not recommend because drug4 be displace from its binding site during the concomitant administration of drug5 , result in lower plasma concentration , peak plasma level , and auc value . 
drug1 : while study have not show drug2 to interact with drug3 , caution should be exercise , nonetheless , since interaction have be see with other drug4 . 
because prostaglandin play a important role in hemostasis , and drug1 affect platelet function as well , concurrent therapy with all drug2 , include drug3 , and drug4 require close monitoring of patient to be certain that no change in they drug5 dosage be require . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 : drug4 , like other drug5 , may affect renal prostaglandin and increase the toxicity of certain drug . 
ingestion of drug1 may increase serum concentration of drug2 and drug3 and increase drug4 be nephrotoxicity . 
patient who begin take drug1 or who increase they drug2 dose or any other drug3 while take drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 may develop toxicity characteristic for these drug . 
they should be observe closely , particularly if renal function be impaired . 
in the case of drug1 , serum level should be monitor . 
drug1 : drug2 decrease drug3 renal clearance and increase drug4 plasma level . 
in patient take drug1 and drug2 concomitantly , drug3 toxicity may develop . 
oral drug1 : drug2 do not alter glucose metabolism in normal subject nor do it alter the effect of oral drug3 . 
there be rare report , however , from marketing experience , of change in effect of drug1 or oral drug2 in the presence of drug3 that necessitate change in the dose of such agent . 
both hypo - and hyperglycemic effect have be report . 
a direct causal relationship have not be establish , but physician should consider the possibility that drug1 may alter a diabetic patient s response to drug2 or oral drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 and other drug3 can inhibit the activity of drug4 . 
concomitant treatment with drug1 may be associate with increase serum potassium level . 
other drug : in small group of patient -lrb- 7-10 / interaction study -rrb- , the concomitant administration of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or drug7 do not significantly affect the peak level and auc value of drug8 . 
drug1 toxicity have be report to have occur in a patient on chronic drug2 treatment follow the initiation of drug3 therapy . 
protein binding in vitro , drug1 interfere minimally or not at all with the protein binding of drug2 -lrb- 20 % decrease in binding -rrb- , drug3 , drug4 -lrb- 10 % decrease in binding -rrb- , or drug5 . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 have no influence in vitro on the protein binding of drug9 in human serum . 
drug/laboratory test interaction effect on blood coagulation : drug1 increase platelet aggregation time but do not affect bleeding time , plasma thrombin clotting time , plasma fibrinogen , or factor v and vii to XII . 
statistically significant change in prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time have be report in normal volunteer . 
the mean change be observe to be less than 1 second in both instance , however , and be unlikely to be clinically important . 
drug1 be a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor , however , and all drug that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis interfere with platelet function to some degree ; 
therefore , patient who may be adversely affect by such a action should be carefully observe . 
certain other drug1 -lrb- drug2 and drug3 -rrb- have also be report to interfere with the nerve transmission at the neuromuscular junction . 
base on this report activity , they should not be give concomitantly with drug1 parenteral except with the greatest caution . 
drug1 -lrb- eg , drug2 -rrb- and other drug , include ether , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 , potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be use with extreme caution in patient be treat with drug7 parenteral . 
drug1 may enhance the nephrotoxicity of drug2 parenteral . 
the concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 parenteral should be avoid . 
Antiacid , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , Indanavir , drug5 , drug6 , Phenobarbitol , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , Ritanovir , drug10 . 
although drug1 use alone have little or no effect on pupil size , mydriasis result from concomitant therapy with drug2 and drug3 may occur . 
close observation of the patient be recommend when a drug1 be administer to patient receive catecholamine-depleting drug such as drug2 , because of possible additive effect and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope or postural hypotension . 
patient receive drug1 along with either oral or intravenous drug2 should be monitor for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbance , leave ventricular failure and hypotension . 
in patient with impaired cardiac function , simultaneous use should be avoid altogether . 
the concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 and drug3 s may have additive effect on prolong atrioventricular conduction time . 
drug1 and drug2 may have additive hypotensite effect due to the inhibition of each other s metabolism . 
drug1 : concurrent use may blunt the response to drug2 . 
drug1 should be withdraw at least 48 hour before conduct a drug2 - mediated stress test . 
drug1 -lrb- such as drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 -rrb- : concurrent use with drug5 may have a proarrhythmic effect . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , drug3 or other drug4 , or drug5 : concurrent use with drug6 may produce additive inotropic and/or chronotropic effect . 
other drug1 -lrb- e.g. drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and general drug5 -rrb- have additive or potentiating effect with drug6 . 
when patient have receive such drug , the dose of drug1 require will be less than usual . 
follow the administration of drug1 , the dose of other drug2 should be reduce . 
there be no known drug/drug interaction with drug1 . 
drug1 have be show to have neuromuscular block property that may enhance the action of other drug2 . 
therefore , it should be use with caution in patient receive such agent . 
antagonism have be demonstrate between drug1 and drug2 in vitro . 
because of possible clinical significance , these two drug should not be administer concurrently . 
interaction with other cn agent : concurrent use of drug1 with all drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , other drug6 , general drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 and drug13 -rrb- may result in additive central nervous system depressant effect . 
respiratory depression , hypotension , and profound sedation or coma may occur . 
when such combined therapy be contemplate , the dose of one or both agent should be reduce . 
although no interaction between drug1 and drug2 have be observe , it be not recommend for use with drug3 . 
most case of serious or fatal adverse event involve drug1 report to the manufacturer or the FDA have involve either the administration of large initial dose or too frequent dose of the drug to nonopioid tolerant patient , or the simultaneous administration of drug2 with other drug affect respiration . 
the initial dose of drug1 should be reduce by approximately 50 % or more when it be give to patient along with another drug affect respiration . 
interaction with drug1 : drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 and drug7 -rrb- should not be administer to a patient who have receive or be receive a course of therapy with a drug8 such as drug9 . 
in drug1 - dependent patient , drug2 may precipitate withdrawal symptom . 
drug1 -lrb- 10 mg once daily -rrb- have be coadminister with therapeutic dose of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 in controlled clinical pharmacology study in adult volunteer . 
although increase plasma concentration -lrb- auc 0-24 hr -rrb- of drug1 and/or drug2 be observe follow coadministration of drug3 with each of these drug in normal volunteer -lrb- n = 24 in each study -rrb- , there be no clinically relevant change in the safety profile of drug4 , as assess by electrocardiographic parameter , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , and adverse event . 
there be no significant effect on qtc interval , and no report of sedation or syncope . 
no effect on plasma concentration of drug1 or drug2 be observe . 
plasma concentration -lrb- auc 0-24 hr -rrb- of drug1 decrease 15 % with coadministration of drug2 relative to that observe with drug3 alone . 
the clinical relevance of this difference be unknown . 
these above finding be summarize in table 1 . 
table 1 effect on plasma concentration -lrb- auc 0-24 hr -rrb- of drug1 and drug2 after 10 day of coadministration -lrb- drug3 10 mg -rrb- in normal volunteer 
drug1 drug2 
drug1 -lrb- 500 mg q8h -rrb- + 40 % +46 % 
drug1 -lrb- 300 mg qid -rrb- +103 % + 6 % 
drug1 -lrb- 200 mg q12h -rrb- +307 % +73 % 
there do not appear to be a increase in adverse event in subject who receive oral drug1 and drug2 . 
no drug interaction have be report . 
drug1 : drug2 be know to interact with the metabolism or renal tubular excretion of many drug -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 agent , drug15 , and drug16 -rrb- . 
concomitant medication should be carefully assess . 
drug1 should either be temporarily discontinue or decrease by 50 % when coadminister with drug2 on the day of drug3 infusion . 
nephrotoxic agent : concomitant administration of drug1 and agent with nephrotoxic potential -lsb- e.g. , intravenous drug2 -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -rrb- , drug6 , drug7 , intravenous drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 -rsb- be contraindicate . 
such agent must be discontinue at least seven day prior to start therapy with drug1 . 
drug1 , a drug2 , may antagonize the bactericidal effect of drug3 and concurrent use of these drug should be avoid . 
the concomitant use of drug1 or other drug2 may have a additive effect . 
drug1 : there be no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between drug2 and drug3 which have be confirm clinically . 
drug1 also have no significant effect on the intracellular phosphorylation of drug2 , as show in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cell or in two other cell line -lrb- u937 and molt-4 -rrb- . 
in the same study it be show that drug1 and drug2 have no significant effect on the intracellular phosphorylation of drug3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell . 
drug1 : in vitro study in peripheral blood mononuclear cell , u937 and molt-4 cell reveal that drug2 significantly inhibit drug3 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner . 
effect be already see with dose correspond to relevant plasma level in human , and the intracellular phosphorylation of drug1 to its three metabolite -lrb- include the active zalcitabine triphosphate metabolite -rrb- be significantly inhibit . 
drug1 inhibit drug2 phosphorylation at high concentration ratio -lrb- 10 and 100 -rrb- ; 
however , it be consider to be unlikely that this decrease of phosphorylate drug1 concentration be of clinical significance , as drug2 be a more efficient substrate for deoxycytidine kinase than drug3 . 
these in vitro study suggest that concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 in human may result in sub-therapeutic concentration of active phosphorylate drug3 , which may lead to a decrease drug4 effect of drug5 . 
it be unknown how the effect see in these in vitro study translate into clinical consequence . 
concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 be not recommend . 
drug1 : the combination of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 have be study -lrb- as triple combination -rrb- in adult .

extreme caution should be exercise when administer drug1 to such patient , with dose reduction as recommend in DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION , Table 17 . 
InjectionSite Reaction : injection site reaction , include reaction secondary to extravasation , be usually mild and consist of erythema , tenderness , skin discoloration , or swell at the injection site . 
these reaction have be observe more frequently with the 24-hour infusion than with the 3-hour infusion . 
recurrence of skin reaction at a site of previous extravasation follow administration of drug1 at a different site , ie , recall , have be report rarely . 
rare report of more severe event such as phlebitis , cellulitis , induration , skin exfoliation , necrosis , and fibrosis have be receive as part of the continue surveillance of drug1 safety . 
in some case the onset of the injection site reaction either occur during a prolonged infusion or be delay by a week to ten day . 
a specific treatment for extravasation reaction be unknown at this time . 
give the possibility of extravasation , it be advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration . 
drug1 be metabolize by cyp2c9 and cyp3a4 . 
inhibition of these isoenzyme may increase the plasma concentration of drug1 . 
drug1 be a inducer of cyp3a4 and cyp2c9 . 
consequently , plasma concentration of drug metabolize by these two isoenzyme will be decrease when drug1 be co-administered . 
drug1 have no relevant inhibitory effect on any cyp isoenzyme test -lrb- cyp1a2 , cyp2c9 , cyp2c19 , cyp2d6 , cyp3a4 -rrb- . 
consequently , drug1 be not expect to increase the plasma concentration of drug metabolize by these enzyme . 
drug1 , include oral , injectable , transdermal , and implantable drug2 : a interaction study demonstrate that co-administration of drug3 and the oral drug4 drug5 produce average decrease of drug6 and drug7 level of 14 % and 31 % , respectively . 
however , decrease in exposure be as much as 56 % and 66 % , respectively , in individual subject . 
therefore , drug1 , include oral , injectable , transdermal , and implantable form , may not be reliable when drug2 be co-administered . 
woman should practice additional method of contraception and not rely on hormonal contraception alone when take drug1 . 
specific interaction study have demonstrate the following : drug1 : during the first day of concomitant administration , trough concentration of drug2 be increase by about 30-fold . 
steady-state drug1 plasma concentration be 3 - to 4-fold higher than in the absence of drug2 . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 be contraindicate . 
co-administration of drug1 decrease the plasma concentration of drug2 -lrb- a cyp3a4 substrate -rrb- by approximately 50 % . 
drug1 : co-administration of drug2 and drug3 have not be study in man . 
co-administration of drug1 and drug2 result in markedly increase plasma concentration of drug3 in animal . 
caution should be exercise if drug1 and drug2 be use together . 
drug1 : a increase risk of elevated liver aminotransferase be observe in patient receive concomitant therapy with drug2 . 
therefore , the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 be contraindicate , and alternative drug3 should be consider . 
co-administration of drug1 decrease the plasma concentration of drug2 by approximately 40 % . 
the plasma concentration of drug1 be also decrease by approximately 30 % . 
drug1 be also expect to reduce plasma concentration of other oral drug2 that be predominantly metabolize by cyp2c9 or cyp3a4 . 
the possibility of worsen glucose control in patient use these agent should be consider . 
drug1 : co-administration of drug2 125 mg b.i.d. and drug3 , a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor , increase the plasma concentration of drug4 by approximately 2-fold . 
no dose adjustment of drug1 be necessary , but increase effect of drug2 should be consider . 
drug1 and other drug2 : co-administration of drug3 decrease the plasma concentration of drug4 -lrb- a cyp3a4 substrate -rrb- , and its active - hydroxy acid metabolite , by approximately 50 % . 
the plasma concentration of drug1 be not affect . 
drug1 be also expect to reduce plasma concentration of other drug2 that have significant metabolism by cyp3a4 , such as drug3 and drug4 . 
the possibility of reduce drug1 efficacy should be consider . 
patient use cyp3a4 metabolize drug1 should have cholesterol level monitor after drug2 be initiate to see whether the drug3 dose need adjustment . 
drug1 : co-administration of drug2 500 mg b.i.d. for 6 day decrease the plasma concentration of both drug3 -lrb- a cyp2c9 substrate -rrb- and drug4 -lrb- a cyp3a4 substrate -rrb- by 29 and 38 % , respectively . 
clinical experience with concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 in patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension do not show clinically relevant change in inr or drug3 dose -lrb- baseline vs. end of the clinical study -rrb- , and the need to change the drug4 dose during the trial due to change in inr or due to adverse event be similar among drug5 - and placebo-treated patient . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 : drug4 have no significant pharmacokinetic interaction with drug5 and drug6 , and drug7 have no significant effect on plasma level of drug8 . 
no drug interaction have be report between drug1 and the therapy standard in neonate with restricted pulmonary or systemic blood flow . 
standard therapy include drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 ; 
drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 ; 
drug1 ; 
and drug1 , such as drug2 . 
drug1 : the potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between drug2 and other agent have not be formally study . 
when drug1 or drug2 be use at the same time as other medicine or substance the following interaction must be take into account : - drug3 and drug4 may enhance the action of drug5 . 
for this reason , the dose of the drug1 should be reduce by 30 - 50 % at the start of treatment with drug2 or drug3 retard and then titrate accord to the blood clotting parameter 
. 
- the action of drug1 and drug2 may be enhance by drug3 or drug4 . 
this may be due to a improve glucose utilization with simultaneous reduction in drug1 requirement 
. 
- in isolate case , a pronounced though reversible , impairment of renal function -lrb- accompany by a corresponding increase in the serum creatinine level -rrb- have be report in organ transplant patient receive drug1 therapy and concomitant drug2 . 
accordingly , renal function should be closely monitor in these patient and , in the event of relevant significant change in laboratory parameter , drug1 should , if necessary , be discontinue 
. 
- when drug1 or drug2 be use concurrently with drug3 -lrb- e.g. drug4 -rrb- , a interval of at least 2 hour should be maintain between the two medicine , since the absorption of drug5 or drug6 be impaired 
. 
- drug1 or drug2 -lrb- with hepatotoxic potential -rrb- must not be administer together with drug3 or drug4 . 
Care should be give when administer this drug to patient with symptom of myasthenic weakness who be also on drug1 . 
since symptom of anticholinesterase overdose -lrb- cholinergic crisis -rrb- may mimic underdosage -lrb- myasthenic weakness -rrb- , they condition may be worsen by the use of this drug . 
May interact with thyroid medication -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- , drug2 - contain product , drug3 , drug4 -lrb- e.g. , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- , and drug7 -lrb- e.g. , drug8 , drug9 -rrb- . 
this product can affect the result of certain lab test . 
Drug/LaboratoryTest interaction drug1 may interfere with bioassay procedure for the determination of drug2 level . 
since drug1 be primarily eliminate by the kidney , coadministration of drug2 with drug that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentration of either drug3 or the coadminister drug . 
coadministration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 do not result in significant drug interaction . 
the effect of coadministration of drug1 with other drug that be renally eliminate or be know to affect renal function have not be evaluate , and patient should be monitor closely for adverse event when drug2 be coadminister with such drug . 
drug1 have additive effect with drug2 and other drug3 -lrb- drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , etc -rrb- . 
drug1 prolong and intensify the anticholinergic -lrb- dry -rrb- effect of drug2 . 
formal drug interaction study have not be conduct with drug1 . 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis reveal that drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 do not influence drug5 clearance . 
the majority of patient in ra clinical study receive one or more of the follow concomitant medication with drug1 : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , and drug12 . 
concurrent administration of a drug1 with drug2 have be associate with a increase risk of serious infection and no significant additional efficacy over use of the drug3 alone . 
concurrent therapy with drug1 and drug2 be not recommend . 
there be insufficient experience to assess the safety and efficacy of drug1 administer concurrently with drug2 , and therefore such use be not recommend . 
drug1 may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of drug2 or drug3 ; 
also , concurrent use of this medication may antagonise the anti-glaucoma and miotic action of ophthalmic drug1 . 
drug1 : these drug have be report to cause prolonged vasospastic reaction . 
because there be a theoretical basis that these effect may be additive , use of drug1 - contain or drug2 -lrb- like drug3 or drug4 -rrb- and drug5 within 24 hour of each other should be avoid . 
drug1 : coadministration of drug2 result in a 27 % decrease in drug3 clearance and a increase in cmax of approximately 6 % . 
no dose adjustment be necessary . 
other drug1 concomitant use of other drug2 within 24 hour of treatment with drug3 be contraindicate . 
drug1 : the pharmacokinetic of drug2 be not affect by coadministration of drug3 . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- : drug3 -lrb- e.g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 -rrb- have be rarely report to cause weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination when coadminister with drug8 . 
if concomitant treatment with drug1 and a drug2 be clinically warrant , appropriate observation of the patient be advise . 
drug1 : coadministration of drug2 and drug3 result in a 24 % increase in plasma concentration of drug4 . 
no dose adjustment be necessary . 
coadministration of drug1 and the potent cyp3a4 inhibitor drug2 -lrb- 400 mg q.d. for 3 day -rrb- result in a approximately 60 % increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximal plasma concentration of drug3 . 
although the interaction between drug1 and other potent cyp3a4 inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -rrb- have not be study , increase exposure to drug5 may be expect when drug6 be use concomitantly with these medication . 
drug1 be not know to interfere with commonly employ clinical laboratory test . 
no formal drug interaction study have be conduct .

drug1 : in healthy subject give single 500 mg dose of drug2 and drug3 , plasma drug4 mean cmax and auc increase by a average of 34 % and 24 % , respectively , and drug5 mean renal clearance decrease by 14 % . 
no information be available about the interaction of drug1 and drug2 follow multiple dose of either drug . 
although not observe in this study , adverse effect could potentially arise from co-administration of drug1 and drug2 by inhibition of tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter system . 
accordingly , careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of drug1 be recommend in patient concomitantly take drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : as with other drug2 , the renal excretion of drug3 be inhibit by drug4 . 
drug / Laboratory Test interaction as a result of administration of drug1 , a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur . 
this have be observe with Benedict s and fehling s solution and also with Clinitest tablet . 
May interact with the following : drug1 , drug2 -lrb- use with drug3 may prevent the drug4 from work properly ; 
drug1 be metabolize by the liver , and it be theoretically possible that its metabolism may be enhance by drug know to induce hepatic microsomal enzyme . 
however , neither drug1 nor drug2 appear to affect drug3 metabolism . 
binding to plasma protein be not significantly alter by drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 . 
binding to plasma protein be reduce by drug1 and clotibrate and increase by drug2 . 
Cardiovascular collapse in patient treat simultaneously with varapamil and drug1 be rare . 
the combination of therapeutic dose of intravenous drug1 and drug2 in drug3 a-chloralose anesthetized swine have result in ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia . 
it be recommend that the combination of intravenous drug1 and drug2 , such as drug3 , not be use together during the management of malignant hyperthermia crisis until the relevance of these finding to human be establish . 
administration of drug1 may potentiate drug2 - induce neuromuscular block . 
the effectiveness of drug1 - only pill be reduce by hepatic enzyme-inducing drug such as the drug2 drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , and the drug6 drug7 . 
no significant interaction have be find with broad-spectrum drug1 . 
drug1 can inhibit cyp2c19 and induce cyp3a4/5 with potentially important effect on plasma concentration of other drug . 
in addition , several drug1 s that be cytochrome p450 inducer can decrease plasma concentration of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 be evaluate in human liver microsome to determine its capacity to inhibit the major cytochrome p450 enzyme responsible for the metabolism of other drug . 
result demonstrate that drug1 and its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite -lrb- drug2 -rrb- have little or no capacity to function as inhibitor for most of the human cytochrome p450 enzyme evaluate -lrb- cyp1a2 , cyp2a6 , cyp2c9 , cyp2d6 , cyp2e1 , cyp4a9 and cyp4a11 -rrb- with the exception of cyp2c19 and cyp3a4/5 . 
although inhibition of cyp 3a4/5 by drug1 and drug2 do occur at high concentration , it be not likely to be of clinical significance . 
the inhibition of cyp-2c19 by drug1 and drug2 , however , be clinically relevant . 
in vitro , the udp-glucuronyl transferase level be increase , indicate induction of this enzyme . 
increase of 22 % with drug1 and 47 % with drug2 be observe . 
as drug1 , the predominant plasma substrate , be only a weak inducer of udp-glucuronyl transferase , it be unlikely to have a effect on drug that be mainly eliminate by conjugation through udp-glucuronyl transferase -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 -rrb- . 
in addition , drug1 and drug2 induce a subgroup of the cytochrome p450 3a family -lrb- cyp3a4 and cyp3a5 -rrb- responsible for the metabolism of drug3 and oral drug4 , result in a lower plasma concentration of these drug . 
as binding of drug1 to plasma protein be low -lrb- 40 % -rrb- , clinically significant interaction with other drug through competition for protein binding site be unlikely . 
drug1 : potential interaction between drug2 and other drug3 be assess in clinical study . 
the effect of these interaction on mean auc and cmin be summarize in Table 2 : Table 2 : Summary of AED interaction with drug1

1 - nc denote a mean change of less than 10 % 2 - pediatrics 3 - mean increase in adult at high drug1 dose in vivo , the plasma level of drug2 increase by up to 40 % , when drug3 be give at dose above 1200 mg/day . 
therefore , when use dose of drug1 greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy , a decrease in the dose of drug2 may be require . 
the increase of drug1 level , however , be small -lrb- 15 % -rrb- when give with drug2 . 
strong inducer of cytochrome p450 enzyme -lrb- i.e. drug1 , drug2 and drug3 -rrb- have be show to decrease the plasma level of drug4 -lrb- 29-40 % -rrb- . 
no autoinduction have be observe with drug1 . 
hormonal drug1 co-administration of drug2 with a oral drug3 have be show to influence the plasma concentration of the two hormonal component , drug4 -lrb- ee -rrb- and drug5 -lrb- lng -rrb- . 
the mean auc value of ee be decrease by 48 % -lsb- 90 % ci : 22-65 -rsb- in one study and 52 % -lsb- 90 % ci : 38-52 -rsb- in another study -lsb- 1,2 -rsb- .

therefore , concurrent use of drug1 with drug2 may render these drug3 less effective . 
study with other oral or implant drug1 have not be conduct . 
drug1 s : after repeat co-administration of drug2 , the auc of drug3 be lower by 28 % -lsb- 90 % ci : 20-33 -rsb- . 
drug1 produce a decrease of 20 % -lsb- 90 % ci : 18-27 -rsb- of the plasma level of drug2 . 
other drug interaction drug1 , drug2 and drug3 have no effect on the pharmacokinetic of drug4 . 
result with drug1 wshow no evidence of interaction with either single or repeated dose of drug2 . 
the potentiate action of drug1 must be consider when the drug be USED in CONJUNCTION with drug2 such as drug3 , drug4 and drug5 . 
therefore when drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug2 they dosage should be reduce . 
since drowsiness may occur with use of this drug , patient should be warn of this possibility and caution against drive a car or operate dangerous machinery while take drug1 . 
patient should be advise against the simultaneous use of other drug1 , and caution that the effect of drug2 may be increase . 
additive cns depression may occur when drug1 be administer concomitantly with other drug2 include drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
patient receive drug1 should be advise against the concurrent use of other drug2 . 
drug1 prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effect of drug2 . 
it be possible that the cardiovascular action of other drug1 could be enhance by the addition of drug2 . 
in Europe , drug1 be observe to occasionally intensify the effect of drug2 take concomitantly by patient suffer from hypertension ; 
this phenomenon be not observe in north american clinical trial . 
a study in eight healthy volunteer have show a 50 % increase in mean peak drug1 plasma concentration and a 90 % increase in mean area under the curve , after a one week course of drug2 at 1,000 mg/day and drug3 at 90 mg/day . 
this effect may be mediate by the known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome p - 450 by drug1 , which could decrease first pass metabolism of drug2 . 
take a drug1 while you be take or within 2 week of take drug2 may increase the risk of central nervous system depression or may cause a severe high blood pressure reaction . 
no formal drug interaction study with drug1 have be conduct . 
in Study 1 , patient with colorectal cancer be give drug1 / drug2 / drug3 -lrb- bolus-ifl -rrb- with or without drug4 . 
drug1 concentration be similar in patient receive bolus-ifl alone and in combination with drug2 . 
the concentration of drug1 , the active metabolite of drug2 , be on average 33 % higher in patient receive bolus-ifl in combination with drug3 when compare with bolus-ifl alone . 
in Study 1 , patient receive bolus-ifl plus drug1 have a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 diarrhea and neutropenia . 
due to high inter-patient variability and limited sampling , the extent of the increase in drug1 level in patient receive concurrent drug2 and drug3 be uncertain . 
a number of substance affect glucose metabolism and may require drug1 dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring . 
the follow be example of substance that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect and susceptibility to hypoglycemia : oral drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 -lrb- e.g. , drug10 -rrb- , drug11 . 
the follow be example of substance that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect : drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 -lrb- e.g. , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 -rrb- , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 -lrb- e.g. , in oral drug15 -rrb- . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 salt , and drug4 may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of drug5 . 
drug1 may cause hypoglycemia , which may sometimes be follow by hyperglycemia . 
in addition , under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal product such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , the sign of hypoglycemia may be reduce or absent . 
mixing of drug1 
a clinical study in healthy male volunteer -lrb- n = 24 -rrb- demonstrate that mix drug1 with drug2 immediately before injection produce some attenuation in the peak concentration of drug3 , but that the time to peak and the total bioavailability of drug4 be not significantly affect . 
if drug1 be mix with drug2 , drug3 should be draw into the syringe first . 
the injection should be make immediately after mix . 
because there be no datum on the compatibility of drug1 and crystalline drug2 preparation , drug3 should not be mix with these preparation . 
the effect of mix drug1 with drug2 of animal source or drug3 preparation produce by other manufacturer have not be study . 
mixture should not be administer intravenously . 
when use in external subcutaneous infusion pump for drug1 , drug2 should not be mix with any other drug3 or diluent . 
drug1 : drug2 may diminish adrenal suppression by drug3 . 
drug1 injection and potassium-depleting agent : when drug2 be administer concomitantly with potassium-depleting agent -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- , patient should be observe closely for development of hypokalemia . 
in addition , there have be case report in which concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 be follow by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure . 
drug1 : drug2 have be report to cause a significant decrease in drug3 clearance . 
drug1 : concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 may produce severe weakness in patient with myasthenia gravis . 
if possible , drug1 should be withdraw at least 24 hour before initiate drug2 therapy . 
drug1 , oral : co-administration of drug2 and drug3 usually result in inhibition of response to drug4 , although there have be some conflict report . 
therefore , coagulation index should be monitor frequently to maintain the desire anticoagulant effect . 
drug1 : because drug2 may increase blood glucose concentration , dosage adjustment of drug3 may be require . 
antitubercular drug : serum concentration of drug1 may be decrease . 
drug1 : drug2 may increase the clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 : increase activity of both drug2 and drug3 may occur when the two be use concurrently . 
convulsion have be report with this concurrent use . 
dexamethasone suppression test -lrb- dst -rrb- : false-negative result in the dexamethasone suppression test -lrb- dst -rrb- in patient be treat with drug1 have be report . 
thus , result of the DST should be interpret with caution in these patient . 
drug1 : patient on drug2 may be at increase risk of arrhythmia due to hypokalemia . 
drug1 : drug2 may enhance the metabolic clearance of drug3 , result in decrease blood level and lessen physiologic activity , thus require a increase in drug4 dosage . 
drug1 , include oral drug2 : drug3 may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain drug4 , thereby increase they effect . 
hepatic enzyme inducer , inhibitor and substrate : drug which induce cytochrome p450 3a4 -lrb- cyp 3a4 -rrb- enzyme activity -lrb- e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- may enhance the metabolism of drug5 and require that the dosage of the drug6 be increase . 
drug which inhibit cyp 3a4 -lrb- e.g. , drug1 , drug2 such as drug3 -rrb- have the potential to result in increase plasma concentration of drug4 . 
drug1 be a moderate inducer of cyp 3a4 . 
co-administration with other drug that be metabolize by cyp 3a4 -lrb- e.g. , drug1 , drug2 -rrb- may increase they clearance , result in decrease plasma concentration . 
drug1 : drug2 have be report to decrease the metabolism of certain drug3 by up to 60 % , lead to increase risk of drug4 side effect . 
in addition , drug1 alone can inhibit adrenal drug2 synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- : concomitant use of drug3 -lrb- or other drug4 -rrb- and drug5 increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effect . 
drug1 should be use cautiously in conjunction with drug2 in hypoprothrombinemia . 
the clearance of drug1 may be increase with concurrent use of drug2 . 
drug1 : in post-marketing experience , there have be report of both increase and decrease in drug2 level with drug3 co-administration , lead to alteration in seizure control . 
skin test : drug1 may suppress reaction to skin test . 
drug1 : co-administration with drug2 should be employ cautiously , as toxic epidermal necrolysis have be report with concomitant use . 
drug1 : patient on drug2 therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoid and drug3 or drug4 due to inhibition of antibody response . 
drug1 may also potentiate the replication of some organism contain in drug2 . 
routine administration of drug1 or toxoid should be defer until drug2 therapy be discontinue if possible . 
drug1 : coadministration of drug2 , a p-glycoprotein substrate , with oral drug3 result in a reduction in clearance and a increase in drug4 cmax and auc value . 
therefore , if drug1 be administer with drug2 , the clinician should be alert to the possibility of increase in drug3 level . 
drug1 inhibitor felodipine be metabolize by drug2 . 
co-administration of cyp3a4 inhibitor -lrb- eg , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , grapefruit juice , drug4 -rrb- with drug5 may lead to several - fold increase in the plasma level of drug6 , either due to a increase in bioavailability or due to a decrease in metabolism . 
these increase in concentration may lead to increase effect , -lrb- lower blood pressure and increase heart rate -rrb- . 
these effect have be observe with co-administration of drug1 -lrb- a potent drug2 inhibitor -rrb- . 
caution should be use when drug1 inhibitor be co-administer with drug2 . 
a conservative approach to dosing drug1 should be take . 
the follow specific interaction have be report : Itraconazole co-administration of another extend release formulation of drug1 with drug2 result in approximately 8-fold increase in the auc , more than 6 - fold increase in the Cmax , and 2-fold prolongation in the half - life of drug3 . 
erythromycin co-administration of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- with drug3 result in approximately 2.5 - fold increase in the auc and cmax , and about 2 - fold prolongation in the half - life of drug4 . 
grapefruit juice co-administration of drug1 with grapefruit juice result in more than 2-fold increase in the auc and cmax , but no prolongation in the half - life of drug2 . 
cimetidine co-administration of drug1 with drug2 -lrb- a non-specific cyp-450 inhibitor -rrb- result in a increase of approximately 50 % in the auc and the Cmax , of drug3 . 
beta-blocking Agents a pharmacokinetic study of drug1 in conjunction with drug2 demonstrate no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic of drug3 . 
the auc and cmax of drug1 , however , be increase approximately 31 and 38 % , respectively . 
in controlled clinical trial , however , drug1 include drug2 be concurrently administer with drug3 and be well tolerate . 
Digoxin when give concomitantly with drug1 the pharmacokinetic of drug2 in patient with heart failure be not significantly alter . 
drug1 : in a pharmacokinetic study , maximum plasma concentration of drug2 be considerably lower in epileptic patient on long-term drug3 therapy -lrb- eg , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 -rrb- than in healthy volunteer . 
in such patient , the mean area under the drug1 plasma concentration-time curve be also reduce to approximately 6 % of that observe in healthy volunteer .

intensive monitoring of renal function be recommend in patient require any combination of nephrotoxic medication . 
drug1 : drug2 - induce hypokalemia may enhance the curariform effect of drug3 -lrb- e.g. , drug4 -rrb- . 
serum potassium level should be monitor and deficiency correct . 
drug1 : acute pulmonary toxicity have be report in patient receive intravenous drug2 and drug3 . 
drug that inhibit or induce cyp 2d6 and cyp 3a4 may affect the concentration on drug1 . 
drug1 should be use with caution in patient receive other local drug2 or agent structurally related to amide-type local anesthetic since the toxic effect of these drug could be additive . 
in vitro study indicate cyp3a4 isoform and cyp1a2 isoform mediate the metabolism of drug1 to drug2 and drug3 , respectively . 
thus agent likely to be concomitantly administer with drug1 that be metabolize by this isoenzyme family may potentially interact with drug2 . 
although no clinical study have be conduct , it be likely that the metabolism of drug1 may be affect by the known cyp3a4 inducer -lrb- such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- , cyp3a4 inhibitor -lrb- azole antimycotic e.g. , drug5 ; 
certain drug1 e.g. , ritanovir ; 
drug1 e.g. , drug2 ; 
and drug1 e.g. , drug2 -rrb- , cyp1a2 inducer -lrb- drug3 -rrb- and cyp1a2 inhibitor -lrb- drug4 and drug5 -rrb- . 
dosage adjustment may be warrant when drug1 be concurrently administer with cyp3a4 inhibitor and cyp1a2 inhibitor as systemic drug2 level may rise result in toxicity . 
drug1 : steady-state trough concentration of drug2 be about 56 % higher when 8 mg drug3 be coadminister with each dose of drug4 -lrb- 15 mg/kg/day -rrb- in eight neurocysticercosis patient .

drug1 plasma concentration be unchanged 4 hour after dosing . 
drug1 : the pharmacokinetic of drug2 -lrb- drug3 5.8 mg/kg infuse over 20 minute -rrb- be unchanged follow a single oral dose of drug4 -lrb- 400 mg -rrb- in 6 healthy subject . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may increase anticholinergic effect of drug4 . 
drug1 may decrease the effect of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
co-administration of drug1 and drug2 or other agent interfere with neuromuscular transmission -lrb- e.g. , drug3 -rrb- should only be perform with caution as the effect of the drug4 may be potentiate . 
the effect of administer different drug1 serotype at the same time or within less than 4 month of each other be unknown . 
however , neuromuscular paralysis may be potentiate by co-administration or overlap administration of different drug1 serotype . 
as with all drug , the potential exist for interaction with other drug by a variety of mechanism . 
cns-active drug drug1 : drug2 10 mg potentiate the cns-impairing effect of drug3 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after drug4 administration and on the digit symbol substitution test -lrb- dsst -rrb- , symbol copying test , and the variability component of the divide attention test for 2.5 hour after drug5 administration . 
the potentiation result from a cns pharmacodynamic interaction ; 
drug1 do not affect the pharmacokinetic of drug2 . 
drug1 : coadministration of single dose of drug2 20 mg and drug3 75 mg produce additive effect on decrease alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hour after administration . 
the interaction be pharmacodynamic with no alteration of the pharmacokinetic of either drug . 
drug1 : coadministration of a single dose of drug2 20 mg and drug3 20 mg daily for 7 day do not produce any interaction on psychomotor performance .

drug1 : coadministration of a single dose of drug2 and drug3 -lrb- 10 and 25 mg , respectively -rrb- result in a 15 % decrease in maximal plasma concentration of drug4 , but no change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve . 
however , the pharmacodynamic of coadministration of drug1 and drug2 have not be evaluate . 
caution should be exercise when these 2 agent be coadminister . 
drug that induce cyp3a4 drug1 : cyp3a4 be ordinarily a minor metabolize enzyme of drug2 . 
multiple-dose administration of the potent cyp3a4 inducer drug1 -lrb- 600 mg every 24 hour , q24h , for 14 day -rrb- , however , reduce drug2 cmax and auc by approximately 80 % . 
the coadministration of a potent cyp3a4 enzyme inducer , although not pose a safety concern , thus could lead to ineffectiveness of drug1 . 
a alternative non-cyp3a4 substrate drug1 may be consider in patient take cyp3a4 inducer such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
drug that inhibit cyp3a4 cyp3a4 be a minor metabolic pathway for the elimination of drug1 because the sum of desethylzaleplon -lrb- form via cyp3a4 in vitro -rrb- and its metabolite , drug2 and drug3 , account for only 9 % of the urinary recovery of a drug4 dose . 
coadministration of single , oral dose of drug1 with drug2 -lrb- 10 mg and 800 mg , respectively -rrb- , a strong , selective cyp3a4 inhibitor produce a 34 % increase in drug3 s maximal plasma concentration and a 20 % increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve .

there be no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 follow single dose administration -lrb- 10 mg and 600 mg , respectively -rrb- of each drug . 
this be expect because drug1 be primarily metabolize and renal excretion of unchanged drug2 account for less than 1 % of the administer dose . 
because drug1 be metabolize by monoamine oxidase -lrb- mao -rrb- , inhibition of this enzyme prolong and potentiate the effect of drug2 . 
patient who have be treat with drug1 within two to three week prior to the administration of drug2 should receive initial dose of drug3 no greater than one-tenth -lrb- 1/10 -rrb- of the usual dose . 
concurrent administration of low-dose drug1 and drug2 may produce a additive or potentiating effect on urine flow .

because of possible additive effect with other drug1 , concomitant use be not advisable . 
drug1 may increase the effect of other drug2 . 
drug1 may increase or decrease blood glucose level . 
consideration should be take in patient be treat with drug1 agent . 
drug1 decrease urinary excretion of drug2 and may enhance the magnitude and duration of they effect . 
drug1 reduce urinary excretion of drug2 and may enhance its effect . 
drug1 may prevent the urinary antiseptic effect of drug2 . 
drug1 increase drug2 excretion and the drug3 may be decrease . 
drug1 and drug2 use concurrently increase the risk of renal calculus formation . 
drug1 may elevate drug2 level . 
the drug1 test should be conduct in the absence of other drug which directly affect the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropin . 
these would include a variety of preparation which contain drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
the gonadotropin level may be transiently elevated by drug1 , minimally elevated by drug2 , and suppress by oral drug3 and drug4 . 
the response to drug1 may be blunt by drug2 and drug3 which cause a rise in prolactin . 
as drug1 gel have the potential to produce local irritation in some patient , concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical product -lrb- medicate or abrasive soap and cleanser , soap and cosmetic that have a strong dry effect , and product with high concentration of alcohol , astringent , spice or lime -rrb- should be approach with caution . 
particular caution should be exercise in use preparation contain drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 in combination with drug4 gel . 
if these preparation have be use it be advisable not to start therapy with drug1 gel until the effect of such preparation in the skin have subside . 
there have be no formal clinical study to evaluate the drug interaction of drug1 with other medication . 
in vitro study have show that the metabolism of drug1 may be modify by the concomitant administration of compound that induce , inhibit , or be metabolize by cytochrome p450 3a4 , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
caution should be exercise with these drug when treat patient receive drug1 as there be a potential for a significant interaction . 
drug1 accelerate the metabolism of drug2 ; 
therefore , if drug1 replacement be need , drug2 should be prescribe . 
drug1 diminish the effect of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : experience in over 1400 patient in a non-comparative clinical trial have show that concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 be usually well tolerate , but there have be occasional literature report suggest that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure , severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina . 
long acting drug1 : drug2 may be safely co-administer with drug3 , but there have be no controlled study to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination . 
drug1 : Immediate Release Capsules : since there have be isolate report of patient with elevated drug2 level , and there be a possible interaction between drug3 and drug4 , it be recommend that drug5 level be monitor when initiate , adjust , and discontinue drug6 to avoid possible over - or under-digitalization . 
Extended Release Tablets : administration of drug1 with drug2 increase drug3 level in 9 of 12 normal volunteer . 
the average increase be 45 % . 
another investigator find no increase in drug1 level in 13 patient with coronary artery disease . 
in a uncontrolled study of over 200 patient with congestive heart failure during which drug1 blood level be not measure , digitalis toxicity be not observe . 
since there have be isolate report of patient with elevated drug1 level , it be recommend that drug2 level be monitor when initiate , adjust , and discontinue drug3 to avoid possible over - or under-digitalization . 
drug1 : Immediate Release Capsules : there have be rare report of a interaction between drug2 and drug3 -lrb- with a decrease plasma level of drug4 -rrb- . 
drug1 : there have be rare report of increase prothrombin time in patient take drug2 to whom drug3 be administer . 
however , the relationship to drug1 therapy be uncertain . 
drug1 : a study in 6 healthy volunteer have show a significant increase in peak drug2 plasma level -lrb- 80 % -rrb- and area-under-the-curve -lrb- 74 % -rrb- after a 1 week course of drug3 at 1000 mg per day and drug4 at 40 mg per day . 
drug1 produce smaller , non-significant increase . 
the effect may be mediate by the known inhibition of drug1 on hepatic cytochrome p-450 , the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of drug2 . 
if drug1 therapy be initiate in a patient currently receive drug2 , cautious titration be advise . 
drug1 should be avoid by patient with a history of serious reaction to any drug2 , include drug3 and drug4 . 
drug1 should not be use together with drug2 -lrb- drug3 , drug4 -rrb- , another arthritis medication . 
it should also be avoid in patient with blood , liver or kidney disease , recent radiation treatment , or uncontrolled diabetes . 
patient should report to they practitioner any new rash , itch , mouth sore , or unusual taste while take drug1 . 
drug1 be excrete slowly from the body . 
safety and effectiveness in child have not be establish . 
the potential for drug interaction with drug1 have be study in combination with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
there be no clinically significant drug interaction for any of these drug

the use of drug1 may result in additive cns depressant effect when coadminister with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or other drug that produce cns depression . 
serious toxicity may result if drug1 be coadminister with drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- . 
the use of drug1 may result in additive cns depressant effect when coadminister with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or other drug that produce cns depression . 
preliminary datum which suggest that drug1 may inhibit the anti-inflammatory activity of drug2 have not be confirm . 
if leprosy-associated inflammatory reaction develop in patient be treat with drug1 and drug2 , it be still advisable to continue treatment with both drug . 
drug1 : as with other drug2 , concomitant administration of drug3 and drug4 be not generally recommend because of the potential of increase adverse effect . 
drug1 : drug2 have be report to competitively inhibit drug3 accumulation in rabbit kidney slice . 
this may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of drug1 . 
caution should be use when drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : report suggest that drug2 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug3 . 
this interaction should be give consideration in patient take drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : clinical study , as well as post-marketing observation , have show that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patient . 
this response have be attribute to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
during concomitant therapy of drug1 with drug2 , the patient should be observe closely for sign of renal failure , as well as to assure diuretic efficacy . 
drug1 : drug2 have produce a elevation of plasma drug3 level and a reduction in renal drug4 clearance . 
the mean minimum drug1 concentration increase 15 % and the renal clearance be decrease by approximately 20 % . 
these effect have be attribute to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the drug1 . 
thus , when drug1 and drug2 be administer concurrently , subject should be observe carefully for sign of drug3 toxicity . 
drug1 : the effect of drug2 and drug3 on gi bleeding be synergistic , such that user of both drug together have a risk of serious gi bleed higher than user of either drug alone . 
drug1 : in a single dose study -lrb- n = 6 -rrb- , ingestion of a drug2 contain 1.7-gram of drug3 with 500-mg of drug4 increase the cmax and auc of drug5 by 125 % and 36 % , respectively . a number of compound be inhibitor of cyp2c9 include drug6 , drug7 and drug8 . 
drug interaction study of drug1 and these compound have not be conduct . 
the possibility of altered safety and efficacy should be consider when drug1 be use concomitantly with these drug . 
drug interaction : the central drug1 syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agent such as drug2 be administer concomitantly with drug that have secondary anticholinergic action , e.g. , certain drug3 such as drug4 , the drug5 and other drug6 , drug7 , certain drug8 such as the drug9 salt , and drug10 . 
no drug/drug interaction study have be perform . 
there have be no formal drug-interaction study perform with drug1 .

Laboratory Test interaction 
drug1 be not know to interfere with any routine diagnostic test . 
interaction for drug1 analogue -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -rrb- : drug6 : drug7 have be report to reduce intestinal absorption of drug8 ; 
as such it may impair intestinal absorption of any of drug1 . 
drug1 / drug2 : the coadministration of drug3 or drug4 will not affect plasma concentration of drug5 , but may reduce endogenous plasma level of drug6 / ergocalcitriol by accelerate metabolism . 
since blood level of drug1 / ergocalcitriol will be reduce , higher dose of drug2 may be necessary if these drug be administer simultaneously . 
drug1 : drug2 be know to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of calcium excretion in urine . 
some report have show that the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 cause hypercalcemia . 
therefore , precaution should be take when coadministration be necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 dosage must be determine with care in patient undergo treatment with drug3 , as hypercalcemia in such patient may precipitate cardiac arrhythmia . 
drug1 : drug2 may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzyme of drug3 . 
reduction in serum endogenous vitamin d concentration have be observe follow the administration of 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day drug1 for a week to healthy man . 
however , in vivo drug interaction study of drug1 with drug2 have not be investigate . 
drug1 : a relationship of functional antagonism exist between drug2 analogue , which promote calcium absorption , and drug3 , which inhibit calcium absorption . 
phosphate-binding agent : since drug1 also have a effect on phosphate transport in the intestine , kidney and bone , the dosage of phosphate-binding agent must be adjust in accordance with the serum phosphate concentration . 
drug1 : the coadministration of any of the drug2 analogue should be avoid as this could create possible additive effect and hypercalcemia . 
drug1 supplement : uncontrolled intake of additional drug2 - contain preparation should be avoid . 
drug1 : drug2 - contain preparation -lrb- eg , drug3 -rrb- may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be take during therapy with drug4 by patient on chronic renal dialysis . 
drug1 and drug2 may decrease hypoprothrombinemic effect . 
other depressasnt such as drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may enhance cns depression when administer with drug4 . 
May interact with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Drug/Laboratory interaction no formal drug interaction study have be perform with drug1 . 
a immune response to drug1 may interfere with subsequent diagnostic serum test that utilize drug2 
. 
fuck empty sentence 
no formal drug interaction study have be perform with drug1 . 
due to the frequent occurrence of severe and prolonged thrombocytopenia , the potential benefit of medication which interfere with platelet function and/or anticoagulation should be weigh against the potential increase risk of bleeding and hemorrhage . 
patient receive medication that interfere with platelet function or coagulation should have more frequent laboratory monitoring for thrombocytopenia . 
in addition , the transfusion practice for such patient may need to be modify give the increase risk of bleeding . 
patient in clinical study be prohibit from receive growth factor treatment for 2 week prior to the drug1 therapeutic regimen as well as for 2 week follow completion of the regimen . 
because the drug1 have be show to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patient who be on drug2 therapy may require downward adjustment of they drug3 dosage . 
since bacteriostatic drug , such as the drug1 of drug2 , may interfere with the bactericidal action of drug3 , it be not advisable to administer these drug concomitantly . 
concurrent use of drug1 with oral drug2 may render oral drug3 less effective . 
breakthrough bleeding have be report 
drug1 : drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- injection , usp should not be use with drug4 because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure . 
drug1 : drug2 have be report to cause coronary artery vasospasm , and its effect could be additive with drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- injection , usp . 
drug1 and drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- injection , usp should not be take within 24 hour of each other . . 
drug1 : although the result of a clinical study do not indicate a safe problem associate with the administration of drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- injection , usp to subject already receive drug4 , there have be report that drug5 may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of drug6 by block the vasodilate property of epinephrine . 
drug1 : drug2 may provoke vasoconstriction in some patient , predispose to a greater ischemic response to drug3 therapy . 
drug1 -lrb- e. g. drug2 and drug3 -rrb- : agent of the drug4 , of which drug5 -lrb- drug6 -rrb- injection , usp be a member , have be show to interact with drug7 of the drug8 , result in increase plasma level of unchanged alkaloid and peripheral vasoconstriction . 
vasospastic reaction have be report with therapeutic dose of drug1 - contain drug when co-administer with these drug2 . 
drug1 : weakness hyperreflexia , and incoordination have be report rarely when drug2 have be co-administer with drug3 -lrb- e. g. 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- . 
there have be no report case from spontaneous report of drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- injection , usp . 
oral drug1 : the effect of oral drug2 on the pharmacokinetic of drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- injection , USP have not be study . 
the magnitude and relative importance of the effect note below be likely to be patient specific and may vary by such factor as age , gender , race , intercurrent illness , dose of either agent , additional concomitant medication , and timing of drug administration . 
any agent that alter thyroid hormone synthesis , secretion , distribution , effect on target tissue , metabolism , or elimination may alter the optimal therapeutic dose of drug1 sodium . 
drug1 absorption : the follow agent may bind and decrease absorption of drug2 from the gastrointestinal tract : drug3 , drug4 resin , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , soybean flour -lrb- e.g. , infant formula -rrb- , drug8 . 
binding to serum protein : the follow agent may either inhibit drug1 binding to serum protein or alter the concentration of serum binding protein : drug2 and related drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 and drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 . 
thyroid Physiology : the follow agent may alter thyroid hormone or tsh level , generally by effect on thyroid hormone synthesis , secretion , distribution , metabolism , hormone action , or elimination , or altered tsh secretion : drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and related anabolic hormone , complex anion -lrb- drug5 , drug6 , drug7 -rrb- , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 and drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , hepatic enzyme inducer , drug18 , iodinate cholestographic agent , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 , drug23 , drug24 , drug25 , drug26 , drug27 , drug28 , drug29 , drug30 , drug31 , drug32 , drug33 , drug34 . 
Adrenocorticoids : metabolic clearance of adrenocorticoid be decrease in hypothyroid patient and increase in hyperthyroid patient , and may therefore change with change thyroid status . 
drug1 : drug2 therapy alone can cause hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism . 
drug1 -lrb- oral -rrb- : the hypoprothrombinemic effect of drug2 may be potentiated , apparently by increase catabloism of vitamin k-dependent clotting factor . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 -rrb- : requirement for drug4 or oral drug5 may be reduce in hypothyroid patient with diabetes mellitus and may subsequently increase with the initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy . 
drug1 : action of some of drug2 may be impaired when hypothyroid patient become euthyroid . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 -rrb- : drug4 have be report to induce both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism . 
drug1 : therapeutic effect of drug2 may be reduce . 
serum drug1 level may be decrease in hyperthyroidism or when a hypothyroid patient become euthyroid . 
drug1 : marked hypertension and tachycardia have be report in association with concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : risk of cardiac arrhythmia may increase . 
drug1 -lrb- 123i and 131i -rrb- , drug2 : Uptake of radiolabele ion may be decrease . 
drug1 / drug2 : excessive concurrent use of drug3 may accelerate epiphyseal closure . 
untreated hypothyroidism may interfere with the growth response to drug1 or drug2 . 
drug1 : drug2 clearance may decrease in hypothyroid patient and return toward normal when a euthyroid state be achieve . 
drug1 : concurrent use may increase the therapeutic and toxic effect of both drug , possibly due to increase catecholamine sensitivity . 
onset of action of drug1 may be accelerate . 
drug1 : possible increase risk of coronary insufficiency in patient with coronary artery disease . 
in one survey , 2.3 % of patient take drug1 in combination with drug2 experience tremor , as compare to 0.7 % report to occur with drug3 alone . 
the contribution of each of the treatment to this adverse reaction be unknown but the possibility of a drug interaction can not be exclude . 
drug possess beta-blocking property can blunt the bronchodilator effect of drug1 in patient with bronchospasm ; 
therefore , dose greater than the normal antiasthmatic dose of drug1 may be require . 
drug1 have be show to increase the bioavailability of drug2 . 
since this could be explain either by enhance absorption or by a alteration of hepatic metabolism of drug1 , special care should be use in establish the dose require for blood pressure control in such patient . 
synergism have be show between drug1 anesthesia and intravenously administer drug2 . 
during controlled hypotensive anesthesia use drug1 in association with drug2 , high concentration -lrb- 3 % or above -rrb- of drug3 should not be use because the degree of hypotension will be increase and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and a increase in central venous pressure . 
the anesthesiologist should be inform when a patient be receive drug1 . 
drug1 blunt the reflex tachycardia produce by drug2 without prevent its hypotensive effect . 
if drug1 be use with drug2 in patient with angina pectoris , additional antihypertensive effect may occur . 
Care should be take if drug1 be use concomitantly with drug2 s of the drug3 type . 
risk of Anaphylactic Reaction while take drug1 , patient with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergen may be more reactive to repeat challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
such patient may be unresponsive to the usual dose of drug1 use to treat allergic reaction . 
drug/laboratory test interaction the presence of labetalol metabolite in the urine may result in falsely elevated level of urinary catecholamine , metanephrine , normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid when measure by fluorimetric or photometric method . 
in screening patient suspect of have a pheochromocytoma and be treat with drug1 , a specific method , such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction -lrb- e.g. , J Chromatogr 385:241,1987 -rrb- should be employ in determine level of catecholamine . 
drug1 have also be report to produce a false positive test for drug2 when screen urine for the presence of drug use the commercially available assay method Toxi-Lab A -lrb- thin-layer chromatographic assay -rrb- and emit-d.a.u. -lrb- radioenzymatic assay -rrb- . 
when patient be treat with drug1 have a positive urine test for drug2 use these technique confirmation should be make by use more specific method such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique . 
the follow drug interaction be observe in some patient undergo treatment with oral drug1 . 
although the pattern of use for oral drug1 include longer term therapy , particularly for gout and renal calculus , the experience gain may be relevant . 
drug1 / drug2 : drug3 inhibit the enzymatic oxidation of drug4 and drug5 to drug6 . 
this oxidation , which be catalyze by xanthine oxidase , inactivate drug1 . 
in patient receive drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- , the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of drug5 per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of drug6 or drug7 . 
subsequent adjustment of dose of drug1 or drug2 should be make on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effect . 
drug1 : it have be report that drug2 prolong the half-life of the drug3 , drug4 . 
the clinical basis of this drug interaction have not be establish but should be note when drug1 be give to patient already on drug2 therapy . 
consequently , prothrombin time should be reassess periodically in patient receive both drug . 
drug1 : since the excretion of drug2 be similar to that of urate , drug3 , which increase the excretion of urate , be also likely to increase the excretion of drug4 and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 have be associate with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurine -lrb- hypoxanthine and xanthine -rrb- and a increase in urinary uric acid excretion compare with that observe with drug3 alone . 
although clinical evidence to date have not demonstrate renal precipitation of oxypurine in patient either on drug1 alone or in combination with drug2 , the possibility should be keep in mind . 
drug1 : the report that the concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 may contribute to the enhancement of drug4 toxicity in some patient have be review in a attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation . 
review of these case report indicate that the patient be mainly receive drug1 for hypertension and that test to rule out decrease renal function secondary to hypertensive nephropathy be not often perform . 
in those patient in whom renal insufficiency be document , however , the recommendation to lower the dose of drug1 be not follow . 
although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not be establish , current evidence suggest that renal function should be monitor in patient on drug1 and drug2 even in the absence of renal failure , and dosage level should be even more conservatively adjust in those patient on such combined therapy if diminish renal function be detect . . 
drug1 / drug2 : a increase in the frequency of skin rash have be report among patient receive drug3 or drug4 concurrently with drug5 compare to patient who be not receive both drug . 
the cause of the report association have not be establish . 
drug1 : enhance bone marrow suppression by drug2 and other drug3 have be report among patient with neoplastic disease , except leukemia , in the presence of drug4 . 
however , in a well-controlled study of patient with lymphoma on combination therapy , drug1 do not increase the marrow toxicity of patient treat with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and/or drug6 . 
drug1 : drug2 s plasma half-life may be prolong by drug3 , since drug4 and drug5 may compete for excretion in the renal tubule . 
the risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increase if drug1 and drug2 be give concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency . 
drug1 : report indicate that drug2 level may be increase during concomitant treatment with drug3 for injection . 
monitoring of drug1 level and possible adjustment of drug2 dosage should be consider when these drug be co-administered . 
drug1 s conversion to inactive metabolite have be show to be catalyze by xanthine oxidase from rat liver . 
the clinical significance , if any , of these observation be unknown . 
drug1 generally should not be give with drug2 because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of drug3 toxicity . 
read circular for drug1 preparation before use of such concomitant therapy . 
drug1 may increase the ototoxic potential of other drug such as drug2 and some drug3 . 
they concurrent use should be avoid . 
a number of drug , include drug1 , have be show to displace drug2 from plasma protein ; 
a reduction in the usual drug1 dosage may be require in patient receive both drug . 
in some patient , the administration of a drug1 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effect of drug2 , drug3 and drug4 . 
therefore , when drug1 and drug2 be use concomitantly , the patient should be observe closely to determine if the desire effect of the drug3 be obtain . 
drug1 : several short-term controlled study fail to wshow that drug2 significantly affect prothrombin time or a variety of other clotting factor when administer to individual on drug3 . 
however , because bleeding have be report when drug1 and other drug2 have be administer to patient on drug3 , the physician should be cautious when administer drug4 to patient on drug5 . 
drug1 : animal study wshow that drug2 give with drug3 , include drug4 , yield a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood level of the non-aspirin drug . 
single dose bioavailability study in normal volunteer have fail to wshow a effect of drug1 on drug2 blood level . 
correlative clinical study have not be perform . 
drug1 : drug2 , as well as other drug3 , probably reduce the tubular secretion of drug4 base on in vitro study in rabbit kidney slice . 
this may indicate that drug1 could enhance the toxicity of drug2 . 
caution should be use if drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug2 . 
h-2 antagonist : in study with human volunteer , co-administration of drug1 or drug2 with drug3 have no substantive effect on drug4 serum concentration . 
drug1 : clinical study , as well as random observation , have show that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patient . 
this response have be attribute to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
during concomitant therapy with drug1 , the patient should be observe closely for sign of renal failure , as well as to assure drug2 efficacy . 
drug1 : drug2 produce a elevation of plasma drug3 level and a reduction in renal drug4 clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteer . 
the mean minimum drug1 concentration increase 15 % and the renal clearance of drug2 be decrease by 19 % during this period of concomitant drug administration . 
this effect have be attribute to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by drug1 . 
thus , when drug1 and drug2 be administer concurrently , subject should be observe carefully for sign of drug3 toxicity . 
-lrb- read circular for drug1 preparation before use of such concurrent therapy -rrb- . 
renal clearance measurement of drug1 can not be make with any significant accuracy in patient receive drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
these compound interfere with chemical color development essential to the analytical procedure . 
drug1 depress tubular secretion of certain weak acid such as drug2 . 
therefore , patient receive drug1 will have erroneously low erpf and tm drug2 value . 
drug1 should not be administer concomitantly with potent drug2 such as drug3 and drug4 as the potential for ototoxicity be enhance by the combination . 
no formal drug interaction study have be conduct with drug1 . 
the concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 increase substantially the incidence of rash in patient receive both drug as compare to patient receive drug3 alone . 
it be not know whether this potentiation of drug1 rash be due to drug2 or the hyperuricemia present in these patient . 
in controlled clinical trial of drug1 , 22 patient receive concomitant drug2 and drug3 . 
no rash be report in these patient . 
however , this sample size be too small to allow for any conclusion to be draw regard the risk of rash with concomitant drug1 and drug2 use . 
in common with other drug1 , drug2 may reduce the efficacy of oral drug3 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 - or drug3 - contain -rrb- : concomitant administration of 300-mg drug4 capsule with 30 ml drug5 suspension reduce the rate -lrb- cmax -rrb- and extent -lrb- auc -rrb- of absorption by approximately 40 % . 
Time to reach Cmax be also prolong by 1 hour . 
there be no significant effect on drug1 pharmacokinetic if the drug2 be administer 2 hour before or 2 hour after drug3 . 
if drug1 be require during drug2 therapy , drug3 should be take at least 2 hour before or after the drug4 . 
drug1 : as with other drug2 , drug3 inhibit the renal excretion of drug4 , result in a approximate doubling in A.C. a 54 % increase in peak drug5 plasma level , and a 50 % prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life . 
drug1 and Foods fortify with drug2 concomitant administration of drug3 with a therapeutic drug4 contain 60 mg of elemental drug5 -lrb- as feso4 -rrb- or drug6 supplement with 10 mg of elemental drug7 reduce extent of absorption by 80 % and 31 % , respectively . 
if drug1 be require during drug2 therapy , drug3 should be take at least 2 hour before or after the supplement . 
the effect of food highly fortify with elemental drug1 -lrb- primarily drug2 - fortify breakfast cereal -rrb- on drug3 absorption have not be study . 
concomitantly administer drug1 - fortified infant formula -lrb- 2.2 mg elemental drug2 / 6 oz -rrb- have no significant effect on drug3 pharmacokinetic . 
therefore , drug1 for Oral Suspension can be administer with drug2 - fortified infant formula . 
there have be rare report of reddish stool in patient who have receive drug1 in Japan . 
the reddish color be due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between drug1 or its breakdown product and drug2 in the gastrointestinal tract . 
drug/laboratory test interaction a false-positive reaction for ketone in the urine may occur with test use drug1 , but not with those use drug2 . 
the administration of drug1 may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in urine use Clinitest , Benedict be solution , or Fehlings solution . 
it be recommend that glucose test base on enzymatic glucose oxidase reaction -lrb- such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape -rrb- be use . 
drug1 be know to occasionally induce a positive direct coomb test . 
no information available . 
catecholamine-depleting drug , e.g. , drug1 , may have a additive effect when give with drug2 . 
patient treat concurrently with drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observe for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may result in vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
a study of interaction between drug1 and drug2 show that concomitant administration of drug3 and drug4 do not alter drug5 plasma level . 
drug1 concentration be equivocally higher when give with drug2 , but this be not likely to be clinically important . 
when drug1 and drug2 be concomitantly administer intravenously to normal volunteer , there be a 10-20 % increase in drug3 blood level at some time point . 
drug1 do not affect drug2 pharmacokinetic . 
when intravenous drug1 and drug2 be concomitantly administer in normal subject , no effect on drug3 blood level be see , but drug4 steady-state blood level be increase by 46 % in the presence of drug5 . 
no other pharmacokinetic parameter be change . 
the effect of drug1 on the duration of drug2 - induce neuromuscular blockade be study in patient undergo surgery . 
the onset of neuromuscular blockade by drug1 be unaffected by drug2 , but the duration of neuromuscular blockade be prolong from 5 minute to 8 minute . 
although the interaction observe in these study do not appear to be of major clinical importance , drug1 should be titrate with caution in patient be treat concurrently with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 . 
while take drug1 , patient with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergen may be more reactive to repeat challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
such patient may be unresponsive to the usual dose of drug1 use to treat allergic reaction . 
caution should be exercise when consider the use of drug1 and drug2 in patient with depressed myocardial function . 
fatal cardiac arrest have occur in patient receive both drug . 
additionally , drug1 should not be use to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agent which be vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 because of the danger of block cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance be high . 
in patient receive nonselective drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- -lrb- e.g. , drug3 -rrb- in combination with drug4 -lrb- e.g. , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 -rrb- , there have be report of serious , sometimes fatal , reaction . 
because drug1 be a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor , drug2 should not be use concomitantly with a drug3 . 
at least 14 day should elapse between discontinuation of a drug1 and initiation of treatment with drug2 . 
at least 3 week should elapse between discontinuation of drug1 and initiation of treatment with a drug2 . 
a rare , but serious , constellation of symptom , term serotonin syndrome , have be report with the concomitant use of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and agent for migraine therapy , such as drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- and drug5 . 
the syndrome require immediate medical attention and may include one or more of the follow symptom : excitement , hypomania , restlessness , loss of consciousness , confusion , disorientation , anxiety , agitation , motor weakness , myoclonus , tremor , hemiballismus , hyperreflexia , ataxia , dysarthria , incoordination , hyperthermia , shiver , pupillary dilation , diaphoresis , emesis , and tachycardia . 
drug1 should not be administer with other drug2 . 
the appropriate interval between administration of these agent and drug1 have not be establish . 
the use of drug1 with other cns-active drug have not be systematically evaluate ; 
consequently , caution be advise if drug1 and such drug be prescribe concurrently . 
drug1 be highly bind to plasma protein -lrb- 99.9 % -rrb- . 
therefore , caution should be use when administer drug1 concurrently with other highly plasma protein - bind drug with narrow therapeutic index , as competition for bind site may occur . 
the extent of plasma protein binding of drug1 in human plasma be not affect by the presence of therapeutic concentration of drug2 -lrb- 15 mcg / ml -rrb- , nor be the binding of drug3 affect by the presence of drug4 . 
drug1 : coadministration of drug2 and drug3 suspension result in a significant decrease in average steady - state plasma drug4 concentration . 
Alternatives to drug1 should be consider during the course of pcp treatment with drug2 . 
drug1 , another drug2 , be structurally similar to drug3 and may possibly have some of the same drug interaction as drug4 . 
no interaction trial have be conduct with drug1 and drug2 . 
drug / Laboratory Test interaction : it be not know if drug1 interfere with clinical laboratory test or assay result . 
medication that interfere with you body ability to use folate may also increase the need for this drug1 . 
medication can interfere with folate utilization , include : drug1 -lrb- such as drug2 , and drug3 -rrb- drug4 -lrb- sometimes prescribe to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes -rrb- drug5 -lrb- use to control inflammation associate with crohns disease and ulcerative colitis -rrb- drug6 -lrb- a drug7 -rrb- drug8 there have be concern about the interaction between drug9 and drug10 . 
drug1 supplement can correct the anemia associate with vitamin b12 deficiency . 
unfortunately , drug1 will not correct change in the nervous system that result from vitamin b12 deficiency . 
permanent nerve damage could theoretically occur if vitamin b12 deficiency be not treat . 
therefore , intake of supplemental drug1 should not exceed 1000 microgram -lrb- g , sometimes mcg -rrb- per day to prevent drug2 from mask symptom of vitamin b12 deficiency . 
it be important for older adult to be aware of the relationship between drug1 and drug2 because they be at greater risk of have a vitamin b12 deficiency . 
if you be 50 year of age or older , ask you physician to check you b12 status before you take a supplement that contain drug1 . 
ergot-containing drug have be report to cause prolonged vasospastic reaction . 
due to a theoretical risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction , use of drug1 - contain or drug2 -lrb- like drug3 or drug4 -rrb- and drug5 within 24 hour of each other should be avoid -lrb- see a href = frova_od . htm #ci contraindication -rrb- . 
concomitant use of other 5-ht1b / 1d agonist within 24 hour of drug1 treatment be not recommend . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- have be report , rarely , to cause weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination when coadminister with drug7 . 
if concomitant treatment with drug1 and a drug2 be clinically warrant , appropriate observation of the patient be advise . 
drug/laboratory test interaction drug1 be not know to interfere with commonly employ clinical laboratory test . 
elevated plasma level of drug1 have be report with concomitant drug2 use . 
there have be report of drug1 - related side effect in patient on concomitant therapy with drug2 and drug3 . 
therefore , monitoring of drug1 plasma level should be consider and dosage of drug2 adjust , as require . 
drug1 have be show to interfere with the metabolism of drug2 . 
this may lead to reduce clearance of drug1 and the prolongation of its plasma half-life . 
drug1 , include drug2 , may enhance the effect of the oral drug3 drug4 or its derivative . 
when these product be administer concomitantly , prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitor . 
drug1 interfere with the therapeutic action of drug2 . 
drug1 contain drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 ; 
drug1 or divalent or trivalent cation such as drug2 ; 
drug1 contain drug2 ; 
and drug1 , -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , chewable/buffered tablet or the pediatric powder for oral solution may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug3 , result in systemic level considerably lower than desire . 
these agent should not be take within the two hour period before or within the two-hour period after drug1 administration . 
elevated serum level of drug1 have be report with the concomitant use of some drug2 and drug3 . 
therefore , drug1 serum level should be monitor and appropriate drug2 dosage adjustment make when these drug be use concomitantly . 
drug1 when use in combination with other cytotoxic drug may show on-treatment additive toxicity , especially hematologic and gastrointestinal effect . 
concomitant use of drug1 with other cardioactive compound that could cause heart failure -lrb- e.g. , drug2 -rrb- , require close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment . 
there be few datum regard the coadministration of radiation therapy and drug1 . 
in adjuvant trial of drug1 - contain cef-120 or fec-100 chemotherapy , breast irradiation be delay until after chemotherapy be complete . 
this practice result in no apparent increase in local breast cancer recurrence relative to publish account in the literature . 
a small number of patient receive drug1 - base chemotherapy concomitantly with radiation therapy but have chemotherapy interrupted in order to avoid potential overlap toxicity . 
it be likely that use of drug1 with radiotherapy may sensitize tissue to the cytotoxic action of irradiation . 
administration of drug1 after previous radiation therapy may induce a inflammatory recall reaction at the site of the irradiation . 
drug1 be extensively metabolize by the liver . 
change in hepatic function induce by concomitant therapy may affect drug1 metabolism , pharmacokinetic , therapeutic efficacy , and/or toxicity . 
drug1 increase the auc of drug2 by 50 % . 
drug1 treatment should be stop during treatment with drug2 . 
drug-laboratory test interaction there be no known interaction between drug1 and laboratory test . 
drug1 and drug2 : drug3 and drug4 can reduce absorption of drug5 ; 
a interval of at least 4 hour between intake of these agent and drug1 should be observe . 
drug1 : drug2 can inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , increase its plasma level . 
concomitant use of drug1 should be avoid . 
drug1 : in a study of healthy volunteer , drug2 significantly reduce the bioavailability of drug3 . 
a interval of at least two hour between intake of this agent and drug1 should be observe . 
drug1 : after introduction of drug2 -lrb- oral form -rrb- , a sudden increase in serum drug3 level have be report . 
therefore , close monitoring of serum drug1 level be recommend and , if necessary , drug2 should be discontinue . 
intravenous drug1 be show to double the bioavailability of oral drug2 . 
the clinical significance of this increase bioavailability and whether similar increase will occur in patient give oral drug1 be unknown ; 
no other specific drug interaction study be perform . 
Products contain drug1 and other drug2 likely will interfere with absorption of drug3 . 
drug1 be metabolize through the cytochrome p450 system , specifically through the cyp3a and cyp2c19 isozyme . 
study have show that drug1 do not have clinically significant interaction with other drug metabolize by the cytochrome p450 system , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , or drug11 in healthy subject . 
these compound be metabolize through various cytochrome p450 isozyme include cyp1a2 , cyp2c9 , cyp2c19 , cyp2d6 , and cyp3a . 
when drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug2 -lrb- cyp1a2 , cyp3a -rrb- , a minor increase -lrb- 10 % -rrb- in the clearance of drug3 be see . 
because the small magnitude and the direction of the effect on drug1 clearance , this interaction be unlikely to be clinical concern . 
nonetheless , individual patient may require additional titration of they drug1 dosage when drug2 be start or stop to ensure clinically effective blood level . 
drug1 have also be show to have no clinically significant interaction with drug2 . 
in a single-dose crossover study examine drug1 30 mg and drug2 20 mg each administer alone and concomitantly with drug3 1 gram , absorption of the drug4 be delay and they bioavailability be reduce by 17 % and 16 % , respectively , when administer concomitantly with drug5 . 
therefore , drug1 should be take at least 30 minute prior to drug2 . 
in clinical trial , drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug2 delayed-release capsule ; 
this do not interfere with its effect . 
drug1 cause a profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion ; 
therefore , it be theoretically possible that drug1 may interfere with the absorption of drug where gastric ph be a important determinant of bioavailability -lrb- e.g. drug2 , drug3 ester , drug4 salt , drug5 -rrb- .

no drug interaction study have be conduct for drug1 , however the use of orally administer drug2 could , theoretically , interfere with the release of drug3 in the colon . 
the pharmacokinetic interaction list below be potentially clinically important . 
drug that induce hepatic enzyme such as drug1 , drug2 and drug3 may increase the clearance of drug4 and may require increase in drug5 dose to achieve the desire response . 
drug such as drug1 and drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 and thus decrease they clearance . 
therefore , the dose of drug1 should be titrate to avoid steroid toxicity . 
drug1 may increase the clearance of chronic high dose drug2 . 
this could lead to decrease drug1 serum level or increase the risk of drug2 toxicity when drug3 be withdraw . 
drug1 should be use cautiously in conjunction with drug2 in patient suffer from hypopro-thrombinemia . 
the effect of drug1 on oral drug2 be variable . 
there be report of enhance as well as diminished effect of drug1 when give concurrently with drug2 . 
therefore , coagulation index should be monitor to maintain the desire anticoagulant effect . 
drug interaction : a. drug enhancing drug1 effect : oral drug2 : drug3 may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time . 
therefore , when drug1 be give with drug2 or drug3 , a period of at least 5 hour after the last intravenous dose or 24 hour after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood be draw if a valid prothrombin time be to be obtain . 
drug1 : drug such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and other that interfere with platelet-aggregation reaction -lrb- the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patient -rrb- may induce bleeding and should be use with caution in patient receive drug9 . 
the anticoagulant effect of drug1 be enhance by concurrent treatment with drug2 -lrb- human -rrb- in patient with hereditary antithrombin iii deficiency . 
thus in order to avoid bleeding , reduce dosage of drug1 be recommend during treatment with drug2 -lrb- human -rrb- . 
b. 
drug decrease drug1 effect : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of drug6 . 
drug1 injection should not be mix with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 , since it have be report that these drug be incompatible with drug6 and a precipitate may form .

since aminotransferase determination be important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction , liver disease and pulmonary embolus , rise that might be cause by drug -lrb- drug1 -rrb- should be interpret with caution . 
the follow drug have be coadminister with drug1 and have not alter its pharmacokinetic : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
concomitant administration of drug1 with the oral drug2 drug3 have be show not to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of drug4 . 
catecholamine-depleting drug -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- may have a additive effect when give with drug2 agent . 
patient treat with a drug1 plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observe for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
should it be decide to discontinue therapy in patient receive drug1 and drug2 concurrently , the drug3 should be discontinue slowly over several day before the gradual withdrawal of drug4 . 
literature report suggest that oral drug1 may be use in combination with drug2 when heart function be normal , but should be avoid in patient with impaired cardiac function . 
hypotension , av conduction disturbance , and leave ventricular failure have be report in some patient receive drug1 when a oral drug2 be add to the treatment regimen . 
hypotension be more likely to occur if the drug1 be a drug2 , e.g. , drug3 , while leave ventricular failure and av conduction disturbance , include complete heart block , be more likely to occur with either drug4 or drug5 . 
risk of Anaphylactic Reaction : although it be know that patient on drug1 may be refractory to drug2 in the treatment of anaphylactic shock , drug3 can , in addition , interfere with the modulation of allergic reaction and lead to a increase severity and/or frequency of attack .

use of drug1 drug2 and drug3 have be administer concomitantly with and follow infusion of drug4 in the management of acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism . 
because drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 may cause bleeding complication , careful monitoring for bleeding be advise , especially at arterial puncture site . 
the concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 during the first 24 hour follow symptom onset be prohibit in the ninds t-pa Stroke Trial . 
the safety of such concomitant use with drug1 for the management of acute ischemic stroke be unknown . 
Drug-Drug interaction give the primary cns effect of drug1 , caution should be use when drug2 be take in combination with other drug3 and drug4 . 
due to its 
1 - adrenergic receptor antagonism , drug1 have the potential to enhance the effect of certain drug2 . 
potential for other drug to affect drug1 drug2 be not a substrate of cyp1a1 , cyp1a2 , cyp2a6 , cyp2b6 , cyp2c8 , cyp2c9 , cyp2c19 , or cyp2e1 enzyme . 
drug1 also do not undergo direct glucuronidation . 
this suggest that a interaction of drug1 with inhibitor or inducer of these enzyme , or other factor , like smoking , be unlikely . 
both cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 be responsible for drug1 metabolism . 
agent that induce cyp3a4 -lrb- eg , drug1 -rrb- could cause a increase in drug2 clearance and lower blood level . 
inhibitor of cyp3a4 -lrb- eg , drug1 -rrb- or cyp2d6 -lrb- eg , drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 -rrb- can inhibit drug5 elimination and cause increase blood level . 
drug1 : coadministration of drug2 -lrb- 200 mg/day for 14 day -rrb- with a 15-mg single dose of drug3 increase the auc of drug4 and its active metabolite by 63 % and 77 % , respectively . 
the effect of a higher drug1 dose -lrb- 400 mg/day -rrb- have not be study . 
when concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 occur , drug3 dose should be reduce to one-half of its normal dose . 
other strong inhibitor of cyp3a4 -lrb- drug1 -rrb- would be expect to have similar effect and need similar dose reduction ; 
weaker inhibitor -lrb- drug1 , grapefruit juice -rrb- have not be study . 
when the cyp3a4 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , drug1 dose should then be increase . 
drug1 : coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of drug2 with drug3 -lrb- 166 mg/day for 13 day -rrb- , a potent inhibitor of cyp2d6 , increase the auc of drug4 by 112 % but decrease the auc of its active metabolite , drug5 , by 35 % . 
drug1 dose should be reduce to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 occur . 
other significant inhibitor of cyp2d6 , such as drug1 or drug2 , would be expect to have similar effect and , therefore , should be accompany by similar dose reduction . 
when the cyp2d6 inhibitor be withdraw from the combination therapy , drug1 dose should then be increase . 
drug1 : coadministration of drug2 -lrb- 200 mg BID -rrb- , a potent cyp3a4 inducer , with drug3 -lrb- 30 mg qd -rrb- result in a approximate 70 % decrease in cmax and auc value of both drug4 and its active metabolite , drug5 . 
when drug1 be add to drug2 therapy , drug3 dose should be double . 
additional dose increase should be base on clinical evaluation . 
when drug1 be withdraw from the combination therapy , drug2 dose should then be reduce . 
no clinically significant effect of drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 be see on the pharmacokinetic of drug4 -lrb- see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : drug - drug interaction -rrb- . 
potential for drug1 to affect other drug drug2 be unlikely to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interaction with drug metabolize by cytochrome p450 enzyme . 
in in vivo study , 10 - to 30-mg/day dose of drug1 have no significant effect on metabolism by cyp2d6 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , cyp2c9 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , cyp2c19 -lrb- drug4 , drug5 -rrb- , and cyp3a4 -lrb- drug6 -rrb- substrate . 
additionally , drug1 and drug2 do not show potential for alter cyp1a2-mediated metabolism in vitro . 
drug1 : there be no significant difference between drug2 coadminister with drug3 and placebo coadminister with drug4 on performance of gross motor skill or stimulus response in healthy subject . 
as with most psychoactive medication , patient should be advise to avoid drug1 while take drug2

and/or drug/laboratory test interaction see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Drug interaction . 
effect of drug1 on other drug : drug metabolize by cytochrome p450 2d6 -lrb- cyp2d6 -rrb- : drug2 be a strong in vitro inhibitor of cyp2d6 . 
therefore , dose adjustment of concomitant medication that be predominantly metabolize by cyp2d6 and have a narrow therapeutic index -lrb- e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and most drug4 -rrb- may be require . 
drug1 : concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg drug2 with 50 mg drug3 increase drug4 exposure and drug5 -lrb- active metabolite -rrb- exposure by approximately 20 % in cyp2d6 extensive metabolizer . 
effect of other drug on drug1 : drug2 be metabolize by multiple cytochrome p450 enzyme , primarily cyp3a4 , cyp2d6 , and cyp1a2 . 
drug1 : drug2 be metabolize in part by cyp3a4 . 
co-administration of drug1 , a strong inhibitor of cyp3a4 , increase drug2 exposure follow a single 90 mg dose of drug3 by 2.3 fold . 
dose adjustment of drug1 may be require and pth and serum calcium concentration should be closely monitor if a patient initiate or discontinue therapy with a strong cyp3a4 inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ; 
see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION -rrb- . 
special care be require if this drug be give to patient receive drug1 because a critical fall in blood pressure may occur . 
usually , severe abdominal symptom appear before there be such a fall in the blood pressure . 
drug1 be strong drug2 , but regular user develop physiological tolerance allow gradually increase dosage . 
in combination with other drug1 , drug2 may still kill even experienced user , particularly if they tolerance to the drug have reduce or the strength of they usual dose have increase .

drug1 : when drug2 be co-administer with drug3 , the auc and cmax of drug4 be reduce by about 30 % and 50 % , respectively . 
no formal drug interaction study of drug1 have be perform . 
cyp450 metabolize drug result from in vitro and in vivo study suggest that drug1 be unlikely to have significant drug interaction with concomitantly administer drug metabolize by cyp450 enzyme . 
drug1 : no drug interaction with other drug2 have be identify that would warrant alteration of either the drug3 dose or the dose of the other drug4 . 
certain drug tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control . 
these drug include the drug1 and other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , oral drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , and drug12 . 
when such drug be administer to a patient receive drug1 , the patient should be closely observe for loss of blood glucose control . 
when such drug be withdraw from patient receive drug1 in combination with drug2 or drug3 , patient should be observe closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia . 
drug1 -lrb- e. g. , drug2 -rrb- and drug3 contain carbohydrate-splitting enzyme -lrb- e. g. , drug4 , drug5 -rrb- may reduce the effect of drug6 and should not be take concomitantly . 
drug1 have be show to change the bioavailabillty drug2 when they be co-administered , which may require drug3 dose adjustment . 
study in healthy volunteer have show that drug1 have no effect on either the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
drug1 do not interfere with the absorption or disposition of the drug2 drug3 in diabetic patient . 
drug1 may affect drug2 bioavailabillty and may require dose adjustment of drug3 by 16 % -lrb- 90 % confidence interval : 8-23 % -rrb- , decrease mean c max drug4 by 26 % -lrb- 90 % confidence interval : 16-34 % -rrb- and decrease mean trough concentration of drug5 by 9 % -lrb- 90 % confidence limit : 19 % decrease to 2 % increase -rrb- . 
the amount of drug1 absorb while take drug2 be bioequivalent to the amount absorb when take placebo , as indicate by the plasma auc value . 
however , the peak plasma level of drug1 be reduce by approximately 20 % when take drug2 due to a slight delay in the absorption of drug3 . 
there be little if any clinically significant interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 -lrb- e.g. , drug3 -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- e.g. , drug5 -rrb- , local drug6 -lrb- e.g. , drug7 and drug8 -rrb- , drug9 -lrb- drug10 -rrb- - contain preparation -lrb- e.g. , sunscreen and some drug11 -rrb- , drug12 -lrb- e.g. , drug13 -rrb- , drug14 -lrb- sulfa medicine -rrb- , drug15 -lrb- use of these medicine during the test period will affect the test result -rrb- , and pancreatic supplement -lrb- use of pancreatic supplement may give false test result -rrb- . 
know drug interaction include drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 . 
drug1 and drug2 may interact with drug3 in study with male rat , drug4 be find to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day . 
therefore , drug1 have the potential to prolong the biological half-life of drug for which the rate of elimination be dependent on the microsomal drug metabolize enzyme system . 
interact with drug1 
no formal drug interaction study have be perform with drug1 . 
May interact with the following : drug1 -lrb- these medicine may make you condition worse and prevent the drug2 from work properly -rrb- and drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 -lrb- these medicine may increase the risk of heart problem -rrb- . 
interaction for drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- : drug3 therapy : drug4 may potentiate the effect of drug5 and vasoactive drug result in postural hypotension . 
drug1 : concomitant drug2 may decrease the metabolic clearance of drug3 . 
the clinical relevance of this finding be unclear . 
other : concomitant drug1 or hot drink may increase the side effect of flushing and pruritus and should be avoid at the time of drug ingestion . 
the follow agent may increase certain action or side effect of drug1 . drug2 drug3 of class -lrb- e.g. drug4 -rrb- , drug5 drug6 -lrb- e.g. drug7 -rrb- , drug8 . 
drug1 , drug2 -lrb- e.g. , drug3 -rrb- , drug4 and drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and other drug have anticholinergic activity . 
drug1 antagonize the effect of drug2 . 
drug1 in the presence of increase intraocular pressure may be hazardous when take concurrently with agent such as corti costeroid . . 
drug1 may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drug , such as slowly dissolve dosage form of drug2 ; 
increase serum drug1 concentration may result . 
drug1 may antagonize the effect of the drug that alter gastrointestinal motility , such as drug2 . 
because drug1 may interfere with the absorption of drug2 , simultaneous use of these drug should be avoid . 
the inhibiting effect of drug1 on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion be antagonize by agent use to treat achlorhydria and those use to test gastric secretion . 
no dose adjustment be necessary when drug1 be add to triple-immunosuppression regimen include drug2 , drug3 , and either drug4 or drug5 . 
three clinical trial have investigate drug1 use in combination with triple-therapy regimen . 
pharmacokinetic be assess in two of these trial . 
total body clearance of drug1 be reduce by a average 22 % and 51 % when drug2 and drug3 , respectively , be add to a regimen consist of drug4 , usp -lrb- modify -rrb- and drug5 . 
nonetheless , the range of individual drug1 clearance value in the presence of drug2 -lrb- 12-57 ml/h -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- 7-54 ml/h -rrb- do not extend outside the range observe with dual therapy -lrb- 10-78 ml/h -rrb- . 
the follow medication have be administer in clinical trial with drug1 with no increase in adverse reaction : atg/alg , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- blood level may be increase and prolong by concurrent administration of drug3 . 
drug interaction with drug1 : concomitant use of drug2 with drug3 should be avoid . 
if the drug be use together , caution should be exercise because unexpected hypotension could result from beta-blocker inhibition of the sympathetic reflex response to drug1 . 
drug interaction , General : although there have be no formal interaction study , intravenous drug1 have be administer safely with drug such as drug2 and sublingual drug3 . 
there be limited experience with concomitant drug1 such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -lrb- both drug6 - like and loop -rrb- . 
no significant drug interaction have be report in study of drug1 give with other drug such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and oral drug7 in healthy volunteer , or give with drug8 to patient with heart failure -lrb- nyha class ii and iii -rrb- . 
because drug1 be not significantly metabolize by the cytochrome p450 system and at therapeutic concentration have no effect on p450 enzyme , interaction with drug that inhibit or be metabolize by those enzyme would not be expect . 
drug1 reversible increase in serum drug2 concentration and toxicity have be report during concomitant administration of drug3 with drug4 , and with some drug5 . 
a increase in serum drug1 concentration have be report during concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 , so careful monitoring of serum drug4 level be recommend during concomitant use . 
potential for other drug to affect drug1 : both cyp1a2 and cyp2d6 be responsible for drug2 metabolism . 
inhibitor of cyp1a2 : concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 , a inhibitor of cyp1a2 , result in approximately a 6-fold increase in auc and about a 2.5-fold increase in cmax of drug3 . 
some drug1 would be expect to have similar effect and these combination should be avoid . 
inhibitor of cyp2d6 : because cyp2d6 be involve in drug1 metabolism , concomitant use of drug2 with potent inhibitor of cyp2d6 may result in higher concentration of drug3 . 
drug1 -lrb- 20 mg qd -rrb- increase the concentration of drug2 -lrb- 40 mg qd -rrb- by about 60 % , and greater degree of inhibition be expect with higher dose of drug3 . 
similar effect would be expect with other potent cyp2d6 inhibitor -lrb- e.g. , drug1 , drug2 -rrb- . 
potential for drug1 to affect other drug : drug metabolize by cyp1a2 : in vitro drug interaction study demonstrate that drug2 do not induce cyp1a2 activity , and it be unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of cyp1a2 substrate . 
drug metabolize by cyp2d6 : drug1 be a moderate inhibitor of cyp2d6 . 
when drug1 be administer -lrb- at a dose of 60 mg BID -rrb- in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of drug2 , a cyp2d6 substrate , the auc of drug3 increase 3-fold . 
therefore , co-administration of drug1 with other drug that be extensively metabolize by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index , include certain drug2 -lrb- drug3 -lsb- drug4 -rsb- , such as drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 -rrb- , drug8 and drug9 -lrb- e.g. , drug10 , drug11 -rrb- , should be approach with caution . 
plasma drug1 concentration may need to be monitor and the dose of the drug2 may need to be reduce if a drug3 be co-administer with drug4 . 
because of the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death potentially associate with elevated plasma level of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 should not be co-administer . 
drug metabolize by cyp3a : result of in vitro study demonstrate that drug1 do not inhibit or induce cyp3a activity . 
drug1 May have a clinically important interaction with the follow other drug : drug2 : when drug3 and drug4 be administer several hour apart so that peak concentration of each would coincide , drug5 do not increase the impairment of mental and motor skill cause by drug6 . 
in the drug1 clinical trial database , three drug2 - treated patient have liver injury as manifest by ALT and total bilirubin elevation , with evidence of obstruction . 
substantial intercurrent drug1 use be present in each of these case , and this may have contribute to the abnormality see . 
cns acting drug : give the primary cns effect of drug1 , it should be use with caution when it be take in combination with or substitute for other centrally act drug , include those with a similar mechanism of action . 
potential for interaction with drug that affect gastric acidity : drug1 have a enteric coating that resist dissolution until reach a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the ph exceed 5.5 . 
in extremely acidic condition , drug1 , unprotected by the enteric coating , may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol . 
caution be advise in use drug1 in patient with condition that may slow gastric emptying -lrb- e.g. , some diabetic -rrb- . 
drug that raise the gastrointestinal ph may lead to a earlier release of drug1 . 
however , co-administration of drug1 with drug2 - and drug3 - contain drug4 -lrb- 51 meq -rrb- or drug5 with drug6 , have no significant effect on the rate or extent of drug7 absorption after administration of a 40-mg oral dose . 
it be unknown whether the concomitant administration of drug1 affect drug2 absorption . 
in study in normal volunteer , there be no pharmacodynamic interaction between intravenous drug1 and either drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
however , drug1 have the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of drug2 and drug3 . 
since drug1 inhibit platelet function , there be a potential for increase risk of bleeding , particularly in patient maintain on drug2 . 
during clinical trial , drug1 be use concurrently with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , and other medication .

although the clinical significance be not know , it be not recommend that drug1 be take concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : co-administration of a single dose of intravenously administer drug2 -lrb- 20 mg -rrb- reduce the oral absorption of a single 400 mg dose of drug3 administer follow a meal , as evidence by a 27 % decrease in mean cmax and a 22 % decrease in mean auc . 
although the clinical significance be not know , it be not recommend that drug1 be take concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : as with other drug2 , co-administration of drug3 with drug4 result in a increase in the plasma exposure of drug5 , with a 49 % increase in mean cmax , a 122 % increase in mean auc , and a 53 % increase in half-life . 
drug/laboratory test interaction drug1 be know to occasionally induce a positive direct coomb test . 
a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction test -lrb- benedict or fehling solution or with clinitest tablet -rrb- , but not with enzyme-based test for glycosuria -lrb- e.g. , clinistix , tes-tape -rrb- . 
as a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test , it be recommend that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be use to determine blood/plasma glucose level in patient receive drug1 . 
drug1 have be study in several human drug interaction study in which it be administer with a meal and the test drug . 
drug1 be find to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 
drug1 decrease the cmax and auc of sustained-release drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- by approximately 31 % and 11 % , respectively . 
since there be a high degree of variability in the bioavailability of drug1 , the clinical significance of this finding be unclear . 
in clinical study , coadministration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 do not interfere with the lipid-lowering activity of the drug5 . 
other drug have not be study . 
when administer other drug for which alteration in blood level could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy , physician should consider monitor drug level or effect . 
drug1 should be administer with caution to patient who be take other drug2 or drug3 , include drug4 , drug5 and drug6 , or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder -lrb- include manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia -rrb- . 
drug1 have be show to have a additive cns depressant effect when give with either drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 . 
Drug Laboratory Test interaction : prolongation of the template bleeding time have be report during continuous intravenous infusion of drug1 at dosage exceed 24 g/day . 
platelet function study in these patient have not demonstrate any significant platelet dysfunction . 
however , in vitro study have show that at high concentration -lrb- 7.4 mmol/l or 0.97 mg/ml and greater -rrb- drug1 inhibit adp and collagen-induced platelet aggregation , the release of atp and serotonin , and the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet in a concentration-response manner . 
follow a 10 g bolus of drug1 , transient peak plasma concentration of 4.6 mmol/l or 0.60 mg/ml have be obtain . 
the concentration of drug1 necessary to maintain inhibition of fibrinolysis be 0.99 mmol/l or 0.13 mg/ml . 
administration of a 5 g bolus follow by 1 to 1.25 g/hr should achieve and sustain plasma level of 0.13 mg/ml . 
thus , concentration which have be obtain in vivo clinically in patient with normal renal function be considerably lower than the in vitro concentration find to induce abnormality in platelet function test . 
however , higher plasma concentration of drug1 may occur in patient with severe renal failure .

interference with the absorption of oral drug1 supplement have be observe with another positively-charged bile acid sequestrant . 
drug1 drug2 may interfere with the pharmacokinetic of drug that undergo enterohepatic circulation , the discontinuance of drug3 drug4 could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug such as drug5 have be filtrate to a maintenance level while the patient be take drug6 drug7 . 
because drug1 bind bile acid , drug2 drug3 may interfere with normal fat digestion and absorption and thus may prevent absorption of drug4 such as a , d , e , and k . 
when drug1 drug2 be give for long period of time , concomitant supplementation with water-miscible -lrb- or parenteral -rrb- form of drug3 should be consider . 
since drug1 drug2 MAY BIND other drug give concurrently , it be RECOMMENDED that patient take other drug at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hour after drug3 drug4 -lrb- or at as great a INTERVAL AS possible -rrb- to avoid IMPEDING THEIR ABSORPTION . 
cyp3a4 interaction 
drug1 be metabolize by cyp3a4 but have no cyp3a4 inhibitory activity ; 
therefore it be not expect to affect the plasma concentration of other drug metabolize by cyp3a4 .

drug1 s : in a small clinical trial in which drug2 be administer to drug3 treated patient , no effect on prothrombin time be detect . 
however , another drug1 have be find to produce a less than two-second increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteer receive low dose of drug2 . 
also , bleed and/or increase prothrombin time have be report in a few patient take drug1 s concomitantly with drug2 . 
it be recommend that in patient take drug1 , prothrombin time be determine before start drug2 and frequently enough during early therapy to insure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occur . 
once a stable prothrombin time have be document , prothrombin time can be monitor at the interval usually recommend for patient on drug1 . 
if the dose of drug1 be change , the same procedure should be repeat . 
drug1 therapy have not be associate with bleeding or with change in prothrombin time in patient not take drug2 . 
drug1 : in normal volunteer , there be no clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with concomitant administration of single dose of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : in patient with hypercholesterolemia , concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 result in no effect on drug4 plasma concentration . 
oral drug1 : in pharmacokinetic study of drug2 in hypercholesterolemic noninsulin dependent diabetic patient , there be no drug interaction with drug3 or with drug4 
cns drug - give the primary cns effect of drug1 , caution should be use when it be take in combination with other centrally act drug . 
drug1 - although drug2 do not potentiate the cognitive and motor effect of drug3 in a clinical trial , as with other drug4 , the use of drug5 by patient take drug6 be not recommend . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- 
drug that interfere with hemostasis -lrb- drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , etc. -rrb- 
serotonin release by platelet play a important role in hemostasis . 
epidemiological study of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrate a association between use of drug1 that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also show that concurrent use of a drug2 or drug3 potentiate the risk of bleeding . 
thus , patient should be caution about the use of such drug concurrently with drug1 . 
drug1 - in subject who have receive 21 day of 40 mg/day racemic drug2 , combine administration of 400 mg/day drug3 for 8 day result in a increase in drug4 auc and cmax of 43 % and 39 % , respectively . 
the clinical significance of these finding be unknown . 
drug1 - in subject who have receive 21 day of 40 mg/day racemic drug2 , combine administration of drug3 and drug4 -lrb- single dose of 1 mg -rrb- do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic of either drug5 or drug6 . 
drug1 - coadministration of racemic drug2 -lrb- 40 mg/day for 10 day -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- 30 mmol/day for 5 day -rrb- have no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic of drug4 or drug5 . 
nevertheless , plasma drug1 level should be monitor with appropriate adjustment to the drug2 dose in accordance with standard clinical practice . 
because drug1 may enhance the serotonergic effect of drug2 , caution should be exercise when drug3 and drug4 be coadminister . 
drug1 and drug2 - in a controlled study , a single dose of drug3 2 mg co-administer with racemic drug4 40 mg give once daily for 11 day be associate with a mean increase in qtc value of approximately 10 msec compare to drug5 give alone . 
racemic drug1 do not alter the mean auc or cmax of drug2 . 
the mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction be not know . 
drug1 - there have be rare postmarket report describe patient with weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination follow the use of a drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- and drug4 . 
if concomitant treatment with drug1 and a drug2 -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 -rrb- be clinically warrant , appropriate observation of the patient be advise . 
drug1 - combine administration of racemic drug2 -lrb- 40 mg/day for 21 day -rrb- and the cyp1a2 substrate drug3 -lrb- single dose of 300 mg -rrb- do not affect the pharmacokinetic of drug4 . 
the effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 be not evaluate . 
drug1 - administration of 40 mg/day racemic drug2 for 21 day do not affect the pharmacokinetic of drug3 , a cyp3a4 substrate . 
Prothrombin time be increase by 5 % , the clinical significance of which be unknown . 
drug1 - combine administration of racemic drug2 -lrb- 40 mg/day for 14 day -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- titrate to 400 mg/day for 35 day -rrb- do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic of drug4 , a cyp3a4 substrate . 
although trough drug1 plasma level be unaffected , give the enzyme-inducing property of drug2 , the possibility that drug3 might increase the clearance of drug4 should be consider if the two drug be coadminister . 
drug1 - combine administration of racemic drug2 -lrb- titrate to 40 mg/day for 28 day -rrb- and the cyp3a4 substrate drug3 -lrb- single dose of 0.25 mg -rrb- do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic of either drug4 or drug5 . 
drug1 - combine administration of racemic drug2 -lrb- 40 mg -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- 200 mg -rrb- decrease the cmax and auc of drug4 by 21 % and 10 % , respectively , and do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic of drug5 . 
drug1 - combine administration of a single dose of drug2 -lrb- 600 mg -rrb- , both a cyp3a4 substrate and a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 , and drug3 -lrb- 20 mg -rrb- do not affect the pharmacokinetic of either drug4 or drug5 . 
cyp3a4 and -2 c19 inhibitor - in vitro study indicate that cyp3a4 and -2 c19 be the primary enzyme involve in the metabolism of drug1 . 
however , coadministration of drug1 -lrb- 20 mg -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- 600 mg -rrb- , a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 , do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic of drug3 . 
because drug1 be metabolize by multiple enzyme system , inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease drug2 clearance . 
drug metabolize by cytochrome p4502d6 - in vitro study do not reveal a inhibitory effect of drug1 on cyp2d6 . 
in addition , steady state level of racemic drug1 be not significantly different in poor metabolizer and extensive cyp2d6 metabolizer after multiple-dose administration of drug2 , suggest that coadministration , with drug3 , of a drug that inhibit cyp2d6 , be unlikely to have clinically significant effect on drug4 metabolism . 
however , there be limited in vivo datum suggest a modest cyp2d6 inhibitory effect for drug1 , i.e. , coadministration of drug2 -lrb- 20 mg/day for 21 day -rrb- with the drug3 drug4 -lrb- single dose of 50 mg -rrb- , a substrate for cyp2d6 , result in a 40 % increase in Cmax and a 100 % increase in auc of drug5 . 
the clinical significance of this finding be unknown . 
nevertheless , caution be indicate in the coadministration of drug1 and drug metabolize by cyp2d6 . 
drug1 - administration of 20 mg/day drug2 for 21 day in healthy volunteer result in a 50 % increase in Cmax and 82 % increase in auc of the drug3 drug4 -lrb- give in a single dose of 100 mg -rrb- . 
increase drug1 plasma level have be associate with decrease cardioselectivity . 
coadministration of drug1 and drug2 have no clinically significant effect on blood pressure or heart rate . 
electroconvulsive therapy -lrb- ect -rrb- - there be no clinical study of the combine use of ECT and drug1 . 
concomitant administration with racemic drug1 drug2 - since drug3 be the active isomer of racemic drug4 -lrb- drug5 -rrb- , the two agent should not be coadminister . 
drug1 do not exhibit bind to plasma protein -lrb- other than thrombin -rrb- or red blood cell . 
in clinical trial in patient undergo ptca/pci , co-administration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor be associate with increase risk of major bleeding event compare to patient not receive these concomitant medication . 
there be no experience with co-administration of drug1 and plasma expander such as drug2 . 
drug1 should be use with caution in patient with disease state associate with a increase risk of bleeding . 
immunogenicity/re-exposure : in in vitro study , drug1 exhibit no platelet aggregation response against serum from patient with a history of hit/hitts . 
among 494 subject who receive drug1 in clinical trial and be test for antibody , 2 subject have treatment-emergent positive drug2 antibody test . 
neither subject demonstrate clinical evidence of allergic or anaphylactic reaction and repeat testing be not perform . 
nine additional patient who have initial positive test be negative on repeat testing . 
drug / Laboratory Test interaction certain endocrine and liver function test may be affect by drug1 - contain oral drug2 . 
the follow similar change may be expect with larger dose of drug1 : - increase sulfobromophthalein retention 
. 
- increase prothrombin and factor VII , VIII , ix , and x ; 
decrease drug1 ; 
increase norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability 
. 
- increase thyroid-binding globulin -lrb- tbg -rrb- lead to in-creased circulate total thyroid hormone ; 
as measure by pbi , t4 by column , or t4 by radioimmunoassay . 
Free t3 resin uptake be decrease , reflect the elevated tbg ; 
free t4 concentration be unaltered 
. 
- impaired glucose tolerance 
. 
- decrease pregnanediol excretion 
. 
- reduce response to metyrapone test 
. 
- reduce serum folate concentration 
. 
- increase serum triglyceride and phospholipid concentration . 
no formal drug interaction study have be conduct with drug1 . 
in vitro study with human liver microsome indicate that drug1 be primarily a substrate for cytochrome p450 3a4 , 2c19 , and 1a2 . 
patient who be concomitantly receive drug1 and drug that be inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome p450 3a4 should be closely monitor for either toxicity or reduce efficacy . 
during clinical trial , hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia be report in diabetic patient receive oral drug1 . 
patient on oral drug1 receive drug2 treatment may require close monitoring of they blood glucose level and adjustment of the dose of they drug3 . 
Drug Laboratory Test interaction none know . 
the effect of concomitant drug1 administration on the steady-state pharmacokinetic of drug2 . 
drug1 -lrb- ' drug2 ' -rrb- be a newly introduce drug3 with demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
it be extensively metabolize , predominantly by cytochrome p450 3a4 . 
therefore , concurrent administration of drug that induce or inhibit this enzyme may affect drug1 pharmacokinetic . 
this study demonstrate that the potent cytochrome p450 enzyme-inducer drug1 do indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of drug2 , result in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administer concomitantly to patient with dsm-iv-diagnosed schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , or bipolar disorder . 
these result indicate that dosage adjustment of drug1 may be necessary when the two drug be give concurrently and that caution may be require when administer other drug that inhibit or induce cytochrome , particularly p450 3a4 . 
-lsb- drug treatment of erection disorder in patient with cardiovascular disease -rsb- erectile dysfunction be a frequent condition in cardiovascular patient . 
since the arrival of oral drug1 , patient want to know how safe sexual activity be in cardiovascular disease in general and during use of drug2 in particular . 
sexual intercourse with a steady partner cause no more cardiovascular risk than normal daily activity such as ironing , 2 kilometer of walk without climb , paperhanging , play golf or gardening . 
the relative risk of myocardial infarction during sexual activity be not significantly higher than for healthy person . 
the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality be not higher among user of drug1 . 
drug1 be contraindicate in patient use drug2 or who may need to use drug3 , because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure . 
no interaction have be observe with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 and drug5 . 
before prescribe a symptomatic -lrb- pharmaceutical -rrb- treatment for patient with a erection disorder , attention should be give tot the sexological , psychological and medical background of the disorder . 
secondary prevention of atherosclerotic risk factor be also important : regulation of blood pressure and blood sugar level , hyperlipidaemia and obesity , as well as a change of lifestyle -lrb- give up smoking , adapting of diet and more physical exertion -rrb- . 
patient with a very low cardiac capacity should be advise to refrain from treatment of the erection disorder . 
failure of drug1 to modify drug2 induce hypertension in sheep . 
study in rat have show that drug1 administration attenuate certain type of drug2 dependent hypertension , include drug3 hypertension . 
the effect of oral drug1 on drug2 induce hypertension be examine in conscious sheep . 
drug1 have no effect on the blood pressure or metabolic response to drug2 in sheep . 
pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 in healthy male . 
the objective of this study be to determine if there be a pharmacokinetic interaction when drug1 be give with drug2 or drug3 and to determine the effect of these drug on the erythromycin breath test -lrb- ermbt -rrb- . 
twenty-four healthy male subject be randomize to one of two cohort . 
all subject receive drug1 -lrb- 1,200 mg twice a day -rrb- for 4 day , follow by a 7-day washout period , follow by either drug2 -lrb- 300 mg once a day -lsb- qd -rsb- -rrb- -lrb- cohort 1 -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- 600 mg qd -rrb- -lrb- cohort 2 -rrb- for 14 day . 
cohort 1 then receive drug1 plus drug2 for 10 day , and cohort 2 receive drug3 plus drug4 for 4 day . 
serial plasma and urine sample for measurement of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 and they drug4 , be measure by high-performance liquid chromatography . 
drug1 do not significantly affect drug2 's pharmacokinetic . 
drug1 significantly increase the area under the curve at steady state -lrb- auc -lrb- ss -rrb- -rrb- of drug2 by 2.93-fold and the auc -lrb- ss -rrb- of drug3 by 13.3-fold . 
drug1 significantly decrease the auc -lrb- ss -rrb- of drug2 by 82 % , but drug3 have no effect on drug4 pharmacokinetic . 
drug1 decrease the result of the ermbt by 83 % . 
the result of the ERMBT after 2 week of drug1 and drug2 therapy be increase 187 and 156 % , respectively . 
drug1 plus drug2 be well tolerate . 
drug1 plus drug2 be poorly tolerate , and 5 of 11 subject discontinued therapy . 
drug1 markedly increase the metabolic clearance of drug2 , and coadministration be contraindicate . 
drug1 significantly decrease clearance of drug2 and drug3 , and the combination be poorly tolerate . 
drug1 inhibit the ERMBT , and drug2 and drug3 be equipotent inducer of the ERMBT . 
-lsb- the effect of drug1 on the activity of mixed-function mono-oxidase in the liver microsome -rsb- the effect of the drug2 -- the drug drug3 -- on hepatic microsomal monooxygenase activity be study . 
the agent be find to produce some inhibiting activity against hepatic microsomal 7-ethoxycoumarine deethylase in male Wistar rat in vitro and in vivo experiment . 
when give in a dose of 50 mg/kg , drug1 produce no statistically significant effect on the duration of hexanal-induced sleep in mouse . 
the finding suggest that the agent have slight effect on the test activity . 
repeat oral administration of drug1 in sheep : interaction of drug2 with drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
interaction between treatment with drug1 , drug2 -lrb- a drug3 -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- a drug5 -rrb- , and drug6 -lrb- a inducer of microsomal enzyme -rrb- be investigate in sheep . 
a daily dose of 2 mg of drug1 / kg of body weight for 6 day do not affect the plasma enzyme or the antiprothrombinemic effect of drug2 in wether . 
the treatment of ewe with a intravenous -lrb- iv -rrb- injection of drug1 , insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase -lrb- ache -rrb- activity , appear to produce additive effect with those produce by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of drug2 / kg/day . 
in ewe give 40 mg of drug1 / kg for 5 day intraperitoneally -lrb- IP -rrb- , the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of drug2 / kg be significantly reduce and sign of toxicity be not present . 
treatment with daily dose of 2 mg of drug1 / kg for 6 day do not modify the anticholinesterase effect of a 2nd series of treatment give 6 week later . 
pharmacokinetic profile of drug1 in special population . 
the pharmacokinetic of drug1 in healthy normal volunteer have be extensively study and be well describe . 
drug1 be characterise by a high oral bioavailability , low clearance , a small volume of distribution , and a 7-hour half-life . 
it be essentially completely metabolise , therefore little be excrete unchanged . 
drug1 be highly protein bind . 
to investigate the effect of disease state or concomitant drug administration on a patient 's response to drug1 , additional pharmacokinetic study be carry out in special population . 
since drug1 have a well-defined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship , measurement of pharmacokinetic parameter be clinically relevant . 
datum from study to date show that disease state , underlie condition , and concomitantly administer highly protein-bound drug have essentially no effect on drug1 pharmacokinetic . 
therefore , drug1 can generally be give without the need for dosage modification in special population such as uncompromised elderly patient , those with moderate renal impairment , and patient with stable hepatic disease . 
enhance drug1 clearance secondary to drug2 therapy . 
this report describe two case in which drug1 clearance accelerate markedly with concomitant drug2 administration . 
Maximum calculate drug1 clearance range from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 time baseline . 
onset of the interaction begin within five day of begin concurrent therapy . 
with combine use , clinician should be aware , when drug1 be add , of the potential for reexacerbation of pulmonary symptomatology due to lowered serum drug2 concentration . 
in vitro activity of drug1 , either singly or in combination with drug2 , against mycobacterium ulceran . 
the antimicrobial effect of a drug1 , drug2 , either alone or in combination with drug3 , be evaluate in vitro against two type strain and six clinical isolate of mycobacterium ulceran . 
growth of m. 
ulceran be measure by plate count and the bactec radiometric method . 
the minimal inhibitory concentration as well as minimal bactericidal concentration of drug1 against m. 
ulceran be between 0.012 and 0.025 mg/l , while correspond value for drug1 and drug2 be in the range of 0.1-0 .8 mg/l and 0.1-0 .4 mg/l respectively . 
when combine with drug1 , drug2 exhibit strong synergistic activity while only additive effect be observe with the combination of drug3 -lrb- or drug4 -rrb- and drug5 . 
these result suggest that drug1 have a great potential in the treatment of m. 
ulcerans infection . 
pharmacokinetic of drug1 . 
effective use of drug in therapy depend not only on clinical acumen but also on the availability of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic datum . 
such information assist in development of safe dosing regimen , prediction of abnormal handling of drug in state of disease and disorder and anticipation of drug interaction . 
for the drug1 now available in the United States -lrb- drug2 , drug3 and drug4 -rrb- , these datum appear well after clinical pattern of use evolve . 
nonetheless , they relevance continue to be demonstrate by the dependence of each agent on intact liver blood flow and function for normal rate of elimination ; 
by the nonlinear kinetic characteristic for drug1 and drug2 -lrb- and probably for drug3 , as well -rrb- and the derivative implication for decrease dosing frequency requirement ; 
and by observation now appear on the relation between plasma drug level and drug effect , both therapeutic and toxic . 
such datum be discuss herein , with emphasis on those aspect that impact on the clinical use of the drug1 . 
herbal remedy , nephropathy , and renal disease . 
the use of herbal remedy be become increasingly popular in the United States . 
Research have show that herbal remedy use may be associate with acute renal failure . 
in addition , the use of herbal remedy may be detrimental for the patient with compromise renal function . 
patient with renal insufficiency or renal failure may be at risk for further kidney damage as well as complication relate to interaction of herbal remedy with complex renal therapy regimen . 
this article will describe the escalate use of herbal therapy and the hazard of herbal remedy use among patient . 
drug1 and they complication . 
drug that suppress the immune system be widely use . 
they be part of the treatment of patient with organ transplant , malignancy , and increasingly those with condition such as psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , and liver and bowel disease in which inflammation be a aetiological factor . 
because of the broaden indication for drug1 , and the prolonged survival in condition for which they be be use , many patient on immunosuppression be now care for in the community or see in non-specialist hospital , usually in close collaboration with a specialist . 
this article look at five commonly use drug1 in turn -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- , discuss the main , non-infection , unwanted effect , way to avoid they and what to do if problem arise . 
the management of infection be deal with as a separate section . 
drug1 and drug2 similarly inhibit and stimulate drug3 - or drug4 - induce proliferation of prostatic epithelium . 
prostatic epithelium proliferate in a define medium consist of basal medium rpmi1640 contain drug1 -lrb- 1 microgram/ml -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 10 ng/ml -rrb- , and drug3 -lrb- 3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 iu/ml -rrb- . 
although neither drug1 nor drug2 affect the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in rpmi1640 contain drug3 alone , they modify the mitogenic effect of drug4 and drug5 . 
drug1 at 10 -lrb- -10 -rrb- m or drug2 at about 3 x 10 -lrb- -9 -rrb- m inhibit proliferation stimulate by drug3 . 
higher concentration of drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -8 -rrb- - 10 -lrb- -6 -rrb- m -rrb- or drug2 -lrb- 3 x 10 -lrb- -8 -rrb- - 10 -lrb- -7 -rrb- m -rrb- enhance the mitogenic activity of drug3 . 
drug1 have a similar effect in the presence of drug2 . 
however , drug1 stimulate , but do not significantly inhibit , proliferation in the presence of drug2 . 
these result suggest that both drug1 and drug2 , and possibly other drug3 and drug4 , may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of drug5 and drug6 . 
death in drug1 user : cause and rate . 
the world medical literature contain 43 report of death associate with drug1 in a 35-year period . 
these include seven cerebrovascular accident , six sudden cardiac death , three case of hyperpyrexia , eight poisoning of uncertain mechanism and seven case of medical complication of intravenous injection ; 
the remainder be of uncertain cause . 
in contrast , in Ontario alone , in 1972 and 1973 there be 26 death in drug1 user , of which 16 be due to accident suicide or homicide . 
of the remain case , two be cardiac , two hepatic and the rest be mixed drug overdose . 
pulmonary granulomata , subacute hepatitis and other lesion result from intravenous drug use be common finding at autopsy . 
on the basis of the estimate number of regular user of intravenous drug1 in Ontario , the mortality rate in such user be at least four time as high as in the general population of the same age , and be comparable to that in alcoholic and drug2 addict . 
however , the absolute number of drug1 - related death be far greater than the number of death in drug2 or drug3 user . 
-lsb- a pharmacological analysis of the effect of drug1 on stimulate gastric secretion -rsb- chronic experiment on dog with gastric fistula be carry out to study the influence of drug2 and drug3 on drug4 - and drug5 - induce gastric acid secretion . 
it be establish that both angiotensin inhibit gastric acid secretion stimulate by drug1 but not by drug2 . 
comparative analysis of the effect of stimulation and inhibition of cholino - and adrenoreceptor on this inhibitory action of drug1 suggest the mediation of drug2 influence through the modulation of cholinergic reaction of parietal cell in the stomach . 
-lsb- stimulation by drug1 -- a analog of the octapeptide cholecystokinin -- of drug2 binding after the long-term administration of drug3 -rsb- it have be establish in experiment on white male rat that prolong administration -lrb- twice a day for 14 day -rrb- of drug4 -lrb- 0.25 mg/kg -rrb- and drug5 -lrb- 0.25 mg/kg -rrb- result in the reduce interaction between drug6 and low affinity binding site for drug7 in subcortical structure , whereas drug8 binding with high affinity binding site for drug9 increase both in the frontal cortex and subcortical structure of the forebrain . 
after prolonged administration of drug1 the displace effect of drug2 , a analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide , be replace by the stimulant action on drug3 binding . 
it be assume that increase interaction between drug1 and high affinity binding site for drug2 on dopamine2 - and serotonin2-receptor underlie the antipsychotic action of drug3 after they prolonged administration . 
cholecystokinin octapeptide be a necessary factor for realization of this action of drug1 . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in rat . 
the interaction of intramuscularly inject drug1 and its n-demethylated metabolite -lrb- metabolite i -rrb- with drug2 be evaluate in rat . 
five , 10 , 20 , or 50 mg/kg of drug1 alone or 20 , 50 , or 100 mg/kg of metabolite i alone produce less than 10 minute of hypnosis . 
however , drug1 anesthetic requirement -lrb- i.e. , MAC -rrb- be depress in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56 % 1-2 hour and as much as 14 % 5-6 hour after injection of drug2 , 50 mg/kg , im . 
the reduction in MAC be correlate with brain level of drug1 or metabolite I , suggest a drug2 : metabolite I potency ration of 3:1 . 
the half-life of drug1 in plasma and brain be longer in the presence of drug2 than when drug3 be give alone . 
it be conclude that drug1 be not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with drug2 would be expect to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system . 
in vitro interaction of drug1 and drug2 in placental vessel . 
the interaction of drug1 and synthetic drug2 on placental vessel be study in vitro . 
resistance be measure near the placental margin after spontaneous term delivery . 
in seven experiment reaction to drug1 and drug2 be drug3 . 
drug1 produce significantly increase vasoconstriction after a single administration of drug2 . 
in eight experiment the perfusion medium contain drug1 . 
there be no change after a single dose of drug1 . 
the reaction after drug1 remain the same in both group of experiment . 
there be thus a enhancement effect 
there be thus a enhancement effect of drug1 upon the reaction of placental vessel to drug2 in vitro . 
note : dissolution of aerosol particle of drug1 in drug2 , a model drug3 . 
the effect of a drug1 extract from bovine lung , drug2 , on the dissolution rate of aerosol particle of drug3 be determine . 
Aerosol particle of drug1 be generate from a drug2 solution , dry , and collect by a cascade impactor for characterization or by a liquid impinger for dissolution experiment . 
Powder x-ray diffraction , differential scanning calorimetry , differential thermal analysis , and scanning electron microscopy be use to characterize the aerosol particle and start material . 
no change in phase be detect , although the aerosol particle appear to contain residual drug1 . 
the dissolution rate of the aerosol particle in saline be low and variable . 
drug1 increase the extent of dissolution of drug2 in proportion to the add concentration , which be also verify by equilibrium solubilization study . 
drug1 also increase rate of dissolution , in a manner similar to drug2 . 
analysis of the concentration of drug1 follow ultracentrifugation indicate that there be rapid equilibration of drug2 between the drug3 and aqueous phase . 
these result show that drug1 have the potential of enhance the rate and extent of dissolution of drug administer to the lung . 
Anaesthesia and the epileptic pateint . 
a review . 
a review be present of some of the problem that may arise in association with anaesthesia for epileptic patient . 
there be the possibility of precipitate anticonvulsant drug toxicity . 
numerous drug interaction be possible with some drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , which affect hepatic microsomal enzyme system . 
there be the risk of convulsion occur in susceptible patient follow the use of the new drug1 which be capable of induce cns excitability . 
interaction between drug1 and drug2 in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryo . 
in this study we investigate whether also drug1 fulfil the function as co-activator in glutamatergic activation of nmda receptor in the neuronal apparatus of spontaneous motility in chick embryo . 
the successive application of drug1 -lrb- 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight -lrb- e.w. -rrb- 
and drug1 -lrb- 15 mg/kg e.w. -rrb- 
the successive application of drug1 -lrb- 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight -lrb- e.w. -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- 15 mg/kg e.w. -rrb- in a 10 min interval significantly increase the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryo in comparison with the effect of drug3 alone . 
this effect do not depend on the order of application of the drug . 
in 13-day-old embryo , drug1 be ineffective in both dose . 
it be conclude from these result that the modulatory effect of drug1 be evidently a later developmental acquisition -lrb- after day 15 of incubation -rrb- in the embryogenesis of nmda-ergic activation of spontaneous motility in chick embryo similarly as glycinergic inhibition . 
acute effect of different drug1 on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
Diabetic patient have a 20 % higher risk of depression than the general population . 
treatment with drug1 can directly interfere with blood glucose level or may interact with drug2 . 
the treatment of depression in diabetic patient must take into account variation of glycemic level at different time and a comparison of the available drug1 be important . 
in the present study we evaluate the interference of drug1 with blood glucose level of diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
in a first experiment , male adult Wistar rat be fast for 12 h. 
drug1 -lrb- 5 mg/kg -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 30 mg/kg -rrb- , drug3 -lrb- 0.25 mg/kg -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- 20 mg/kg -rrb- drug5 -lrb- 30 mg/kg -rrb- or vehicle be administer . 
after 30 min , fast glycemia be measure . 
a oral drug1 overload of 1 ml of a 50 % drug2 solution be give to rat and blood glucose be determine after 30 , 60 and 90 min . 
drug1 and drug2 do not change fasting or overload glycemia . 
drug1 and drug2 increase blood drug3 at different time after the glucose overload . 
drug1 neutralize the increase of glycemia induce by oral drug2 overload . 
in the second experiment , non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat be fast , and the same procedure be follow for estimation of drug1 tolerance 30 min after drug2 overload . 
again , drug1 neutralize the increase in glycemia after drug2 overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rat . 
these datum raise the question of whether drug1 be the best choice for prolonged use for diabetic individual , because of its antihyperglycemic effect . 
drug1 would be useful in case with potential risk of hypoglycemia . 
drug1 promote the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the microsomal fraction of rat liver and it enhance the effect of oleate in this respect . 
drug1 -lrb- 0.5-2 mm -rrb- promote the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction in a cell-free system derive from rat liver . 
by contrast , drug1 -lrb- 1 mm -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- 1 mm -rrb- have no significant effect on the translocation when add alone . 
drug1 , and to a lesser extent , drug2 , enhance the translocating action of oleate and increase its effectiveness in transfer the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction . 
it be propose that the phosphohydrolase become metabolically active when it combine with membrane and that polyamine might help to regulate this interaction . 
this could facilitate the action of fatty acid and enable cell to increase they capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis to match a increase availability of fatty acid . 
the effect of drug1 and of drug2 anesthesia on drug3 tolerance in dog . 
in a comparison of drug1 tolerance in dog anesthetized with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 , the dosage of drug5 need to cause ventricular tachycardia be significantly higher , as be the ld50 of drug6 , with drug7 or drug8 than with drug9 . 
ventricular tachycardia induce by drug1 be generally convert to sinus rhythm follow administration of drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 but not after administration of drug5 alone or after drug6 . 
excretion of thioether in urine after exposure to electrophilic chemical . 
electrophilic agent -- a class of chemical that include most genotoxic compound -- can be inactivate by reaction with glutathione or other sh-bearing molecule . 
the conjugate so form often appear in the urine as mercapturic acid or other thioether product . 
this paper critically review the suitability of the urinary thioether assay as a method for the detection of exposure to electrophilic agent or they precursor . 
in practice , the greatest value of the thioether assay appear to lie in its signal function . 
this be demonstrate for cigarette smoker and industrial worker involve in chemical waste incineration . 
Whenever increase thioether excretion be observe , it be likely to be due to exposure to one or more suspect compound . 
however , when the thioether concentration range within the limit of the normal value , one must not conclude that there be no , or negligible , exposure . 
more specific application of the assay of thio compound in urine allow development of selective method that may be useful for biological monitoring . 
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to a drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
objective : to report a case of rhabdomyolysis result from concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 . 
case summary : a 64-year-old african-american man be admit to the hospital for worsen renal failure , elevated creatine phosphokinase , diffuse muscle pain , and severe muscle weakness . 
about three week prior to admission , the patient be start on drug1 for sinusitis . 
the patient have be receive drug1 for approximately six month . 
he be treat aggressively with intravenous hydration , drug1 , and hemodialysis . 
a muscle biopsy reveal necrotizing myopathy secondary to a toxin . 
the patient continue to receive intermittent hemodialysis until he death from infectious complication that occur three month after admission . 
there be several factor that could have increase he risk for develop rhabdomyolysis , include chronic renal failure . 
discussion : drug1 be a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4 , the major enzyme responsible for drug2 metabolism . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and other drug2 have result in previous report of rhabdomyolysis . 
other factor may increase the risk of this drug interaction , include the administration of other medication that be associate with myopathy , underlie renal insufficiency , and administration of high dose of drug1 . 
conclusion : drug1 inhibit the metabolism of drug2 that be metabolize by cyp3a4 -lrb- i.e. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- . 
this interaction may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis , particularly in patient with renal insufficiency or those who be concurrently take medication associate with myopathy . 
optimal design for the individual and joint exposure general logistic regression model . 
interest in administer compound in combination lie both in enhance efficacious effect and in limit adverse effect . 
although much statistical work have focus on develop mathematical function to model the joint dose-response curve , relatively little work exist in regard to design experiment for assess joint action . 
a variety of parametric dose-response model base on either the normal or logistic probability distribution have be propose in the literature . 
these model be typically nonlinear in the parameter , and as such , a nonlinear weighted least square approach can be employ for the purpose of design experiment . 
the approach be applicable across a wide variety of setting commonly associate with joint action datum , include continuous and discrete response , alternative error structure , and nonzero background response . 
further , design can be express in term of proportionate response associate with the individual compound rather than dose level , thereby provide for result that be applicable across compound . 
as a precursor to this effort , optimal and minimal experimental design for the case in which a single compound be administer have also be develop . 
although the propose methodology for derive experimental design can be apply to any nonlinear regression model , primary focus be give to the additive and nonadditive independent joint action -lrb- ija -rrb- model for individual and combined exposure propose by Barton , Braunberg , and Friedman -lrb- 1 -rrb- . 
-lsb- the gaba-ergic system and brain edema -rsb- it have be show in rat with experimental toxic and traumatic edema that drug1 -lrb- 1 mg/kg -rrb- remove the antiedematous action of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 and reduce the action of drug6 . 
when the dose of drug1 be minimize to 0.5 mg/kg such a effect be not observe . 
prolonged daily administration of drug1 in a dose of 1 mg/kg result in the development of brain edema . 
it be recommend that gaba-positive drug be include into a complex of treatment measure for edema . 
New oral therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus : the drug1 or insulin sensitizer . 
type 2 diabetes mellitus be a grow problem not only in the United States but also across the world . 
there be now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complication of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy . 
ultimately however , up to 80 % of type 2 diabetic die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease . 
this increase incidence of atherosclerotic disease be intricately associate with insulin resistance , which be a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 2 diabetes . 
there be strong evidence that insulin resistance be involve in the development of not only hyperglycemia , but also dyslipidemia , hypertension , hypercoagulation , vasculopathy , and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . 
this cluster of metabolic abnormality have be term the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
the drug1 -lrb- drug2 and drug3 -rrb- , a new class of oral drug4 , be `` insulin sensitizer '' 
and exert direct effect on the mechanism of insulin resistance . 
these effect not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduce insulin requirement , but also have potentially favorable effect on other component of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
long-term study be need to determine whether the insulin-sensitizing effect of the drug1 can prevent or delay premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , morbidity , and death . 
effect of drug1 on the apparent volume of distribution and elimination of drug2 . 
accord to Gibaldi et al. . 
-lrb- 1968 , 1970 -rrb- , the higher serum concentration of drug1 and drug2 reach after administration of drug3 be due not only to slower renal elimination but also to a altered distribution in the body . 
to determine whether drug1 have a direct effect on the distribution of drug2 , the elimination and distribution of drug3 be study in six patient , five lack kidney function and one with a partially impaired renal function , in the presence or absence of drug4 . 
no significant difference be find between the mean value of the volume of distribution of drug1 with and without drug2 -lrb- 13.0 and 12.6 liter , respectively -rrb- . 
thus , the hypothesis of Gibaldi et al. . 
could not be confirm for drug1 in patient lack kidney function . 
in spite of the absence of kidney function , the value of the elimination rate constant be significantly decrease in the presence of drug1 -lrb- from 0.326 to 0.263 / h -rrb- . 
this might be explain by a blockade by drug1 of the elimination of drug2 by the liver . 
stereoselective behavioral effect of drug1 in pigeon and squirrel monkey . 
the behavioral effect of the stereoisomer of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- be compare with those of drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- in pigeon and squirrel monkey respond under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio -lrb- fi fr -rrb- schedule of food presentation . 
Intermediate dose of drug1 or drug2 produce transient increase in fi respond in monkey and sustained increase in fi respond in pigeon ; 
higher dose decrease fi and fr respond in both species . 
in contrast to its enantiomer , drug1 fail to increase fi respond significantly in either species ; 
at high dose , drug1 decrease fi and fr respond . 
in monkey , drug1 be about 10 time more potent than drug2 in decrease respond , whereas in pigeon drug3 be about equipotent with drug4 . 
in both species , drug1 , but not drug2 , antagonize the rate-decreasing effect of drug3 on fi and fr respond . 
in monkey , the effect of drug1 , but not drug2 or drug3 , be antagonize by drug4 ; 
the dose of drug1 require to antagonize the effect of drug2 be more than 100 time higher than those require to antagonize the effect of drug3 . 
in pigeon , drug1 do not systematically alter the effect of drug2 , drug3 or drug4 . 
drug1 reduce or eliminate the increase in fi respond produce by intermediate dose of either drug2 or drug3 in pigeon , but do not antagonize the decrease in fi or fr respond produce by high dose of pcp or either stereoisomer of drug4 . 
the result demonstrate a high degree of stereoselectivity in the behavioral effect of drug1 . 
the levorotatory isomer have opioid-antagonist and non-opioid agonist effect in pigeon and mixed opioid agonist-antagonist effect in monkey . 
the dextrorotatory isomer , on the other hand , have effect similar to those of drug1 in both species . 
cancer in the elderly : basic science and clinical aspect . 
the incidence of cancer increase progressively with age . 
rearrangement of genome have be find to accompany cellular aging . 
these factor , in concert with age-dependent alteration in immune function and host defense , may help to explain the increase risk of malignant disease in aged person . 
the clinical presentation and natural history of neoplasia be also affect by aging . 
this conference review recent development in these area , examine the effect of drug use in the elderly and implication for management , and discuss current information on how age may influence the response of cancer to therapy . 
prescribe . 
Keys to maximize benefit while avoid adverse drug effect . 
when prescribe for older patient , some physician be overly cautious , and this strategy can result in a less than optimal treatment outcome . 
the reluctance to treat aggressively be understandable because the geriatric population be susceptible to adverse drug reaction . 
the key to maximize therapy lie in individualize it as much as possible . 
there be a number of step physician can take to ensure that they patient be not be undertreated . 
these step include regular reevaluation of dosage and plasma drug concentration , recognition and understanding of drug side effect , and avoidance of certain agent . 
close monitoring allow physician to minimize risk , maximize benefit , and get the most out of what modern medication can do to help older patient . 
determinant of cellular sensitivity to drug1 . 
it be now clear that topoisomerase activity level be a important determinant of sensitivity to topo drug . 
the regulation of topoisomerase be no doubt complex and multifaceted and be probably accomplish through redundancy at many control level . 
the mechanism -lrb- s -rrb- of altered topo i expression in certain tumor type be unknown , but may be relate to the central importance of topoisomerase in proliferate cell function -lrb- transcription , replication , etc. -rrb- , and the aberrant and chronic activation of these function as a result of specific tumorigenic alteration . 
small difference in sensitivity to chemotherapy can have a dramatic effect on cure rate , and therefore subtle cell type-specific difference may be important determinant of drug sensitivity . 
whether abnormal topoisomerase quantity and specific activity be associate with resistance or sensitivity to topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy in the clinic be now be study . 
determinant downstream of cleavable complex formation that affect the sensitivity of tumor versus normal cell to topo drug in particular and dna-damaging agent in general be little known . 
the goal of enhance selective tumor cell killing relative to the normal cell that be dose limit may be achieve either by overcome tumor cell resistance or by protect normal cell . 
both of these strategy will become more feasible as specific molecular difference between tumor and normal cell be be rapidly identify and new combination therapy that take advantage of these difference be be design and test . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in absorption and retention . 
the effect of supplementary oral drug1 and drug2 , as well as the interaction between both at the absorption site , fecal and urinary excretion as well as the retention of these trace element be determine by use four diet contain either 9 or 63 micrograms/kg of drug3 and 48 or 446 mg/kg of drug4 over a period of 19 day in a total of 24 rat . 
retention be calculate by the balance technique and by the comparative slaughter technique . 
after one day , fecal as well as urinary excretion of both element have already respond to the dietary treatment , with constant value be reach after approximately three day . 
drug1 excretion be enhance by supplementary drug2 ; 
fecal excretion , too , be increase by supplementary drug1 ; 
whereas urinary excretion be decrease in both case . 
additional drug1 significantly inhibit the absorption of drug2 in both dietary drug3 treatment . 
the lower rate of absorption in the group receive 446 mg drug1 instead of 48 mg of drug2 per kg diet result in a decrease renal excretion of drug3 . 
consequently , the effect of drug1 on the retention of drug2 be lower than on absorption . 
this suggest that interaction between the two element only take place at the site of absorption . 
because of the low dietary drug1 concentration as compare to the drug2 contents of the diet , no effect of drug3 on drug4 absorption and excretion occur . 
difference in drug1 balance be only observe between both dietary concentration , show a higher absolute but a lower relative absorption as well as retention in the group feed further drug2 . -lrb- abstract truncate at 250 word -rrb- 
-lsb- importance of pharmacogenetic -rsb- Pharmacogenetics deal with the difference in effect of drug cause by genetic variation . 
difference can occur in therapeutic effect and in adverse event . 
genetic variation in metabolism may result in high concentration of drug and a increase risk of adverse effect in slow metabolizer , which be important when use for example drug1 or chemotherapy . 
genetic variation also occur in protein interact with drug , which may change the effect of e.g. 
asthma drug and drug1 . 
the selection of drug and they dosage may be improve , and the number of adverse effect reduce by pharmacogenetic investigation . 
however , it may be important also in case of medical examination for insurance and job appointment , since some patient may turn out to need expensive drug or to be susceptible to a certain disease . 
therefore , the use of genetic datum in these instance have to be regulate . 
drug1 overdose recognize by a drug2 assay . 
altered mental status in a adolescent present a diagnostic challenge , and the clinician depend on clinical evaluation and laboratory study to determine therapy and prognosis . 
we report the case of a adolescent with altered consciousness cause by drug1 overdose with a positive drug2 level to alert clinician to the cross-reactivity of drug3 with a toxicology screen for drug4 . 
drug1 . 
treatment plan for patient take drug1 can become complicated . 
drug1 predispose a patient to bleed problem . 
many drug use in dentistry can not be take concomitantly with these medication . 
acute drug1 administration do not affect subjective response to drug2 in human . 
rationale : stress and drug1 facilitate and reinstate psychostimulant self-administration in rodent . 
however , the effect of stress and drug1 on the subjective and behavioral effect of drug2 have not be well study in human . 
objective : to examine the effect of acute drug1 pretreatment on the subjective and behavioral effect of drug2 . 
method : drug1 -lrb- 100 mg -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- 20 mg -rrb- be administer orally to 16 healthy male and female volunteer in a four-session , placebo-controlled , within-subject , crossover design . 
to prevent stomach irritation , subject receive drug1 before each experimental session . 
dependent measure include self-reported mood and subjective effect -lrb- Addiction Research Center inventory , the profile of mood state , and a series of visual analogue scale -rrb- , vital sign , salivary cortisol , and psychomotor performance . 
result : drug1 elevated salivary cortisol level , produce modest dysphoria , and reduce subject ' report of want more drug . 
however , drug1 pretreatment do not affect any of the physiological , behavioral , or subjective effect of drug2 . 
conclusion : in contrast to the effect of drug1 in rodent study , these result indicate that a acute increase in cortisol do not enhance the psychostimulant effect of drug2 in human . 
effect of drug1 on drug2 - induce change in steroid hormone level and lethality in male rat . 
we examine the effect of exogenous drug1 on the change in serum steroid hormone level induce by a nonlethal dose of escherichia coli drug2 in male rat and the death due to nonlethal and lethal dose of drug3 . 
injection of drug1 5 min before a nonlethal dose of drug2 change the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rat to drug3 . 
the serum estrogen concentration of drug1 + drug2 - treat rat decrease by 50 % , while those of the drug3 - treat rat increase -lrb- 2 - to 5-fold -rrb- . 
the serum androgen concentration of drug1 + drug2 - treat rat do not change significantly , while those of drug3 - treat rat drop to 30-40 % 
0.001 . 
exogenous drug1 also appear to influence the percentage of drug2 - induce death in a dose-dependent manner . 
it reduce the number of death induce by nonlethal -lrb- 2 mg/kg -rrb- dose of drug1 but increase the number of death induce by a highly lethal dose -lrb- 8 mg/kg -rrb- . 
these result , together with the known relationship between drug1 and the immune response , suggest that drug2 affect the course of septic shock in a complex fashion and may have either protective or deleterious effect . 
study on the mechanism of action of drug1 : effect of drug2 on respiration and cell permeability of candida albican . 
the drug1 , drug2 , inhibit the growth of several species of candida . 
candida albican , one of the pathogenic species , be totally inhibit at a concentration of approximately 10 mug/ml . 
endogenous respiration be unaffected by the drug at a concentration as high as 100 mug/ml , whereas exogenous respiration be markedly sensitive and inhibit to a extent of 85 % . 
the permeability of the cell membrane be change as evidence by the leakage of 260-nm absorb material , amino acid , protein , and inorganic cation . 
the result we present clearly show that the drug alter the cellular permeability , and thus the exogenous respiration become sensitive to the drug . 
interferon induction : tool for establish interaction among homopolyribonucleotide . 
hitherto unrecognized interaction between homopolyribonucleotide and complex thereof be suggest by interferon induction datum obtain in a highly sensitive assay system of primary rabbit kidney cell culture superinduce by metabolic inhibitor . 
drug1 : a therapeutic update . 
background : since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998 , drug1 have be use by million of man for the treatment of erectile dysfunction . 
recent study and consensus report have expand we understanding of its efficacy , safety , contraindication , and drug interaction . 
objective : this paper review recent study of the efficacy of drug1 , its adverse effect and drug interaction , and socioeconomic factor involve in its use , with a focus on specific patient population -lrb- prostate cancer , diabetes mellitus , ischemic heart disease , spinal cord injury , neurologic disorder -rrb- . 
method : clinical study , case report , and commentary and editorial concern drug1 publish in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 be identify through search of medline , premedline , and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts , use the term drug2 , drug3 , and erectile dysfunction . 
result : drug1 have demonstrate effectiveness in man with erectile dysfunction associate with prostatectomy , radiation therapy , diabetes mellitus , certain neurologic disorder , and drug therapy -lrb- eg , drug2 -lsb- drug3 -rsb- -rrb- . 
it have not be as effective in woman with sexual dysfunction , with the exception of drug1 - associate sexual dysfunction . 
some disorder unrelated to sexual dysfunction -lrb- eg , esophageal motility dysfunction -rrb- may also respond to drug1 . 
in the general population , drug1 be consider to have a acceptable tolerability profile ; 
however , patient with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those take drug1 therapy be at increase risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effect with drug2 therapy . 
in addition , patient take drug that inhibit the cytochrome p450 3a4 isozyme , which metabolize drug1 , may experience increase drug concentration and possible toxicity from normal dose of drug2 . 
conclusion : drug1 be a effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in man . 
the decision to prescribe this agent should include such consideration as the cost-risk-benefit balance , patient access , drug distribution pathway , and prescription drug coverage . 
tumor phenotype and susceptibility to progression as a expression of subpopulation of initiate murine cell . 
currently , it be conceive that a number of event , or hit , be require for the induction of tumor by chemical agent . 
the first phase of this sequence , initiation , be consider to result from at least one event in the genetic apparatus . 
analysis of this sequence , however , usually give little consideration to the nature of the target cell or to the characteristic of the resultant tumor . 
Vesselinovitch et al. . 
-lrb- cancer res. , 38 : 2003-2010 , 1978 -rrb- have report that a single , small pulse of carcinogen can induce early and numerous liver tumor when administer neonatally to mouse with a genetic predisposition to hepatotumorigenesis . 
in the current study , the nonpredisposed strain c57bl/6n be also show to be highly susceptible to diethylnitrosamine during the neonatal period . 
c57bl/6n demonstrate large number of two of the three type of liver tumor see in liver of genetically predispose mouse , one of which require the additional stimulus of dietary drug1 for growth . 
tumor of more malignant phenotype be demonstrate only in genetically predispose mouse -lrb- c57bl/6n x c3h/hen f1 -rrb- that receive one dose of carcinogen . 
these finding suggest that the phenotype of a tumor that result from a pulse of a chemical carcinogen may depend upon the target cell . 
the initiate cell that result from this hit may vary from those that demonstrate very little progression in cell type and may or may not require exogenous enhancement of growth to those that can progress very rapidly to fully malignant behavior . 
the latter might arise from a hit in a genetically initiate cell , the result of which be a more rapid progression in tumor type . 
effect of drug1 upon the metabolism of chylomicron-like emulsion in patient with coronary artery disease . 
slow chylomicron intravascular catabolism have be associate with coronary artery disease and screening for drug that can speed-up this process can be important . 
in this study , the effect of drug1 upon chylomicron metabolism be test by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 12 patient with coronary artery disease , aged 59 + / -11 year , -lrb- total cholesterol : 240 + / -41 mg/dl ; triglyceride : 188 + / -42 mg/dl -rrb- submit to a randomize , crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled study with administration of 1 g per day drug2 or placebo for 1-month . 
a 1-month washout period be insert between the treatment period . 
patient be intravenously inject a chylomicron-like emulsion doubly label with 14c-cholesteryl oleate and 3h-triolein at baseline and after treatment . 
after drug1 treatment , there be decrease of total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma level and a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma level . 
drug1 elicit 62 % enhancement of post - drug2 lipolytic activity and 100 % increase of 3h-triglyceride fractional clearance rate compare with placebo treatment . 
14c-cholesterol ester fractional clearance rate be 260 % greater after drug1 than after placebo . 
therefore , a potent effect of drug1 on both chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal be achieve , indicate that this drug can be use to improve this metabolism in future prospective study . 
selective survival in drug1 and drug2 of pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype o11 from drug addict . 
the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa , particularly serotype o11 , in drug1 and drug2 
be evaluate as a possible explanation for the association of deep-seated infection with this organism and abuse of these drug . 
the mean reduction of growth cause by the drug be 1,000-fold greater for 49 pseudomonas strain from normal subject than for 32 strain from drug addict -lrb- 4.2 vs. 1.3 log of reduction at 2 hr , p less than .0005 -rrb- . 
a common phenotypic subset of the serotype o11 strain from drug addict be especially resistant to the inhibitory effect . 
twelve strain of staphylococcus aureus -lrb- a frequent cause of infection in drug1 , but not in drug2 and drug3 , addict -rrb- be completely inhibit by the drug combination . 
dose-response curve -lrb- derive from the result of use the tablet as well as pure powder -rrb- show that drug1 be responsible for the inhibitory activity , which be partially antagonize by drug2 . 
we conclude that a ability of some p. 
aeruginosa serotype o11 strain , but not S. 
aureus , to survive in drug1 and drug2 may explain in part a shift from S. 
aureus to P. 
aeruginosa as common pathogen of drug addict in area where abuse of this combination of drug have increase . 
influence of coadministration of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetic and qtc interval in healthy volunteer . 
study objective : to evaluate the effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetic and cardiovascular safety of drug2 at steady state in healthy man . 
design : open-label , three-phase , sequential study . 
SETTING : clinical research center . 
subject : twelve healthy male volunteer . 
intervention : each subject be treat accord to the following sequence : baseline ; 
phase 1 -lrb- day 1-6 -rrb- : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ; 
washout -lrb- day 7-13 -rrb- ; 
phase 2 -lrb- day 14-44 -rrb- : drug1 20 mg/day ; 
and phase 3 -lrb- day 45-52 -rrb- : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day -lrb- day 45-51 -rrb- plus drug2 20 mg/day -lrb- day 45-52 -rrb- . 
measurement and MAIN result : blood sample be draw and 12-lead electrocardiogram perform at specify time point after the last morning dose of drug1 in phase 1 and 3 . 
blood sample also be take before morning dose on the 3rd , 4th , and 5th day of phase 1 and 3 . 
electrocardiogram be do at baseline and on the last day of the washout period and phase 2 . 
coadministration of drug1 significantly decrease drug2 plasma concentration . 
there be no clinically significant change in correct qt interval during administration of drug1 alone or with drug2 . 
drug1 be well tolerate when administer alone or with drug2 . 
conclusion : drug1 can be administer safely to patient receive low therapeutic dosage of drug2 . 
activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 against cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture . 
the in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 be investigate . 
drug1 show moderate activity , which increase with increase concentration to 55.7 % suppression of growth at 20 microm . 
moreover , its activity be enhance when it be combine with either drug1 or drug2 with 90 % parasite reduction at the highest concentration test . 
drug1 may be active in inhibit cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either drug2 or drug3 . 
modification of surface histidine residue abolish the cytotoxic activity of drug1 . 
drug1 display both cytotoxic and enterotoxic activity . 
it have recently be demonstrate that drug1 exert its cytotoxic effect by the glucosylation of the small gtp-binding protein of the rho family . 
drug1 , at ph 7.0 , be use to chemically modify expose histidine residue on drug2 . 
modification of drug1 with drug2 abolish both its cytotoxic activity and the ability of the toxin to bind zn-sepharose gel . 
treatment of drug1 with -lsb- -lrb- 14 -rrb- c -rsb- - drug2 reveal concentration dependent labelling of histidine residue on the toxin molecule . 
the effect of drug1 could be reverse by drug2 treatment . 
these datum suggest the modify histidine residue on drug1 be critical to its cytotoxic activity . 
histidine modification have no effect on the glucosyl transferase enzyme activity of drug1 . 
however , modification abolish the ` cold ' binding of toxin to bovine thyroglobulin in a elisa and reduce ligand binding activity in a rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination assay . 
the datum suggest that the histidine residue may be crucial to the receptor-binding activity of drug1 . 
expose histidine on drug1 be available for drug2 chelation , and these have be exploit in the development of a novel purification protocol for drug3 use drug4 - chelate chromatography . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in vitro . 
the minimal inhibitory concentration of drug1 and drug2 alone and in combination be determine by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic , facultative , and anaerobic clinical isolate . 
all 77 strain of staphylococcus aureus , diplococcus pneumoniae , streptococcus pyogene , and anaerobic bacterium -lrb- except for three strain of clostridium -rrb- be inhibit by 1.6 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
drug1 do not interfere with the activity of drug2 within the range of concentration test -lrb- 0.1 to 100 mug/ml -rrb- ; 
for some strain combination be synergistic . 
sixty-two -lrb- 94 % -rrb- of 66 strain of Enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa be inhibit by 6.2 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
combination of drug1 and drug2 be indifferent for 29 strain and synergistic for 33 strain . 
all 20 strain of enterococcus , three strain of Clostridium , three strain of escherichia coli , and one strain of Proteus rettgeri be resistant to both drug1 -lrb- minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml -rrb- and drug2 -lrb- minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml -rrb- . 
combination of drug1 and drug2 be indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strain . 
except for drug1 - sensitive isolate , synergy be usually observe only at concentration of one or both drug which be not readily obtainable in vivo . 
antagonism be never observe . 
drug1 and the common cold . 
evaluation of its efficacy and toxicity . 
we review the clinical datum relate to the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic dose of drug1 in the prevention and treatment of the common cold . 
although one study tentatively support the hypothesis that such dose of drug1 may be efficacious , a second study by the same group do not confirm the significant finding , and no clear , reproducible pattern of efficacy have emerge from the review of all the evidence . 
similarly , there be currently little adequate evidence on either the presence or the absence of serious adverse reaction to such dose of drug1 , although many such reaction have be hypothesize . 
the unrestricted use of drug1 for these purpose can not be advocate on the basis of the evidence currently available . 
effect of drug1 in a light/dark test in mouse and the contribution of adenosine receptor . 
we investigate the effect of adenosine receptor antagonist , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -lrb- drug5 -rrb- , in a light/dark test in mouse . 
all antagonist decrease the time spend in the light zone in this test , which suggest that these compound have anxiogenic effect . 
the anxiogenic effect of drug1 be reduce by pretreatment with drug2 , a a2-selective agonist , but not by drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- , a a1-selective agonist . 
however , the antagonism of the drug1 - induce anxiogenic effect by drug2 be only observe in the time spend in the light zone , and drug3 - induce anxiogenic effect be neither reverse by drug4 nor by drug5 . 
finally , it be notable that xanthine-derived adenosine antagonist test here commonly show anxiogenic effect in the light/dark test in mouse . 
it be suggest that there be a minor contribution of adenosine receptor to these effect , although drug1 - induce anxiogenic effect be antagonize by a a2 receptor agonist . 
restoration of drug1 susceptibility in enterococcus faecalis by antiresistance determinant gene transfer . 
we assess the ability of gene transfer to reverse drug1 resistance in class a -lrb- vana -rrb- glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecalis . 
recombinant shuttle vector contain a vanh promoter-vana antisense gene cassette fully restore drug1 susceptibility through a combined transcriptional activator binding domain decoy and inducible vana antisense rna effect . 
induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cell in response to drug1 and drug2 . 
1 , drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , the active metabolite of drug3 , be a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . 
we have show that mcf-7 cell treat with 100 nm drug1 exhibit characteristic apoptotic morphology -lrb- pyknotic nucleus , chromatin and cytoplasmic condensation , nuclear matrix protein reorganization -rrb- within 48 h . 
in the experiment report here , we examine the interaction between drug1 and the drug2 drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- , which also induce apoptosis in mcf-7 cell . 
we datum suggest that drug1 significantly potentiate the reduction in cell number induce by drug2 alone . 
combined treatment with drug1 and drug2 enhance the degree of apoptosis assess use morphological marker that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation . 
we have select a subclone of mcf-7 cell resistant to drug1 -lrb- mcf-7d3re -rrb- . 
these cell express the vitamin d receptor and exhibit double time comparable to the parental mcf-7 cell , even when grow in 100 mm drug1 . 
treatment of both parental and resistant mcf-7 cell with drug1 induce apoptosis and clusterin . 
these datum emphasize that apoptosis can be induce in mcf-7 cell either by activation of drug1 - mediate signalling or disruption of drug2 - dependent signalling . 
cholinergic role in drug1 's effect on evoke potential in visual cortex of the albino rat . 
photic evoke potential be record from the visual cortex of chronically implant albino rat . 
since photic evoke potential component be representation of neural pathway which be activate during photic stimulation , study of the effect of drug1 on these component may help to trace pathway which be affect by drug2 . 
in the present study , evoke potential be record at 5 , 20 , and 40 min follow IP injection of saline , drug1 -lrb- 2.0 g/kg -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 0.6 mg/kg -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- 15.0 mg/kg -rrb- on separate day . 
drug1 depress the amplitude of most evoke potential component in comparison to saline administration . 
component p2 , however , be increase in amplitude . 
drug1 briefly reduce the amplitude of most component , include p2 . 
in contrast , drug1 increase the amplitude of component p1 and p2 , while decrease component n1 , n2 and n3 for vary duration of time . 
drug1 pretreatment augment the depressant effect of drug2 on the early component p1 and n1 , while attenuate drug3 's influence on component p2 and p3 . 
pretreatment with drug1 likewise further reduce the amplitude of component p1 and n1 , and produce a similar effect on component n3 . 
drug1 , either alone or in combination with drug2 , produce approximately the same degree of enhancement of component p2 . 
in comparison to saline value , all three agent produce reliable increase in peak latency for most of the component , with only n3 show no effect . 
the amplitude datum from this study suggest that drug1 's augmentation of component p2 may result , at least in part , from alteration in cholinergic function . 
increase hepatotoxicity of drug1 by concomitant administration of drug2 in the rat . 
since drug1 be frequently co-administer with drug2 , it be of clinical interest to study the effect of drug3 on the hepatotoxicity of drug4 . 
in male sprague-dawley rat fast for 18 h , concomitant administration of drug1 -lrb- 0.1 g/kg , i.p. -rrb- 
as judge by increase serum enzyme activity and increase incidence of hepatic necrosis . 
careful observation on hepatotoxicity be suggest when drug1 be prescribe with drug2 . 
dual effect of drug1 on the drug2 - induce contraction and norepinephrine release in the guinea-pig vas deferen . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , c129h223n3o54 , isolate from marine coelenterate of palythoa tuberculosa , cause a first rapid contraction follow by the slow phasic contraction of guinea-pig va deferen . 
in the presence of drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- m -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -8 -rrb- m -rrb- fail to cause the first contraction ; 
however , the second contraction be potentiate . 
in the presence of drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -6 -rrb- m -rrb- , the second contraction be inhibit selectively . 
when drug1 be apply to the muscle in the presence of drug2 , both first and second contractile response to drug3 be abolish . 
when the muscle be expose to the potassium-depleted solution , the first contractile response to drug1 be rather potentiated . 
drug1 cause the release of norepinephrine from the muscle . 
exposure of the muscle to drug1 -lrb- 10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- m -rrb- markedly increase the drug2 - induce release . 
it be indicate that the first and second contractile response to drug1 have entirely different property . 
the second response be due to a release of norepinephrine from nerve and be potentiate by drug1 through the increase in the norepinephrine release , whereas the first response be not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and be inhibit by drug2 . 
the mechanism of the action of drug1 be discuss in the relation with na,k-atpase . 
analgesic effect of drug1 . 
the literature provide considerable evidence indicate that several , but not all drug1 , be indeed drug2 and some be drug3 as well . 
those for which effectiveness be report include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
the proposed mechanism of analgesic action of drug1 be review and discuss . 
the literature suggest that more than one mechanism of action exist for they . 
there be considerable evidence suggest that histaminergic and serotoninergic central pathway be involve in nociception and that drug1 drug can modulate they response -lrb- 1 -rrb- . 
the evidence for a role for norepinephrine and dopamine and the effect of drug1 on they be less well establish . 
still other pathway have be propose . 
a greater understanding of pain mechanism will aid in elucidate the role of drug1 in analgesia . 
effect of drug1 on voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype in bovine chromaffin cell . 
in previous report we have show that drug1 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel in neuronal cell . 
however , these study do not show whether drug1 - induce inhibition of ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- current discriminate among the various ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype , although it be know that there be at least five different ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype in neuronal cell . 
in this study we investigate the effect of drug1 on high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- channel subtype use they drug2 drug3 -lrb- l-type -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- n-type -rrb- , or drug5 -lrb- p-type -rrb- in bovine chromaffin cell . 
we could observe that drug1 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- current in a dose-dependent manner . 
the ic -lrb- 50 -rrb- be about 120 microgram/ml . 
drug1 have no effect on drug2 response . 
these datum suggest that drug1 be negatively couple to three type of calcium channel in bovine chromaffin cell , include a drug2 - sensitive -lrb- n-type -rrb- channel , a drug3 - sensitive -lrb- p-type -rrb- channel and drug4 / drug5 / drug6 - resistant -lrb- presumptive q-type -rrb- channel . 
thus , the selective regulation of voltage-dependent ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- subtype by drug1 in bovine chromaffin cell could be the cellular basis of antistress effect induce by drug2 . 
a propose mechanism for the potentiation of camp-mediated acid secretion by drug1 . 
acid secretion in isolate rabbit gastric gland be monitor by the accumulation of -lsb- -lrb- 14 -rrb- c -rsb- drug1 . 
stimulation of the gland with drug1 synergistically augment the response to dibutyryl camp . 
the augmentation persist even after drug1 be wash out and be resistant to chelated extracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- and to inhibitor of either protein kinase c or calmodulin kinase ii . 
drug1 at 10 microm preferentially block the secretory effect of drug2 and its synergism with camp , whereas it have no effect on histamine - or camp-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min . 
drug1 inhibit the drug2 - stimulate intracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- concentration -lrb- -lsb- ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- -rrb- increase due to release from the ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- store . 
treatment of the gland with drug1 redistribute type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor -lrb- the major subtype in the parietal cell -rrb- from the fraction contain membrane of large size to the microsomal fraction , suggest a dissociation of the store from the plasma membrane . 
these finding suggest that intracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- release by cholinergic stimulation be critical for determine synergism with camp in parietal cell activation and that functional coupling between the ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- store and the receptor be maintain by actin microfilament . 
Phenytoin intoxication induce by drug1 . 
a patient have phenytoin intoxication after administration of drug1 , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . 
the serum concentration of drug1 increase dramatically from 16.6 to 49.1 microg/ml when drug2 be coadminister , although the daily dosage of drug3 and other drug4 have not change . 
during drug1 and fluvoxamine treatment , ataxia , a typical side effect of drug2 , be observe . 
the genotype of drug1 and 2c19 , the enzyme responsible for phenytoin metabolism , be homozygous for the wild-type allele -lrb- drug2 * 1 / * 1 and 2c19 * 1 / * 1 -rrb- . 
the interaction may be a result of inhibition of both drug1 and 2c19 by drug2 . 
pharmacokinetic evaluation of the drug1 - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 be know to raise serum drug2 level . 
this study be design to evaluate the pharmacokinetic basis of this interaction in 10 normal subject . 
the pharmacokinetic variable for drug1 be determine after a 1.0 mg intravenous dose of drug2 in each subject , before and after oral drug3 , 400 mg daily for 3 week . 
during drug1 administration , systemic clearance of drug2 be reduce from 234 + / - 72 ml/min -lrb- mean + / - standard deviation -rrb- to 172 + / - 33 ml/min -lrb- p less than 0.01 -rrb- . 
this be due to reduction in both renal clearance -lrb- from 105 + / - 39 to 84 + / - 15 ml/min -rrb- -lrb- p less than 0.05 -rrb- and nonrenal clearance -lrb- from 130 + / - 38 to 88 + / - 20 ml/min -rrb- -lrb- p less than 0.01 -rrb- . 
drug1 half-life of elimination be prolong from 34 + / - 13 to 40 + / - 16 hour -lrb- p less than 0.05 -rrb- . 
drug1 volume of distribution be not significantly change . 
drug1 cause a three - to fivefold increase in serum reverse triiodothyronine level , but change in thyroid function be not quantitatively related to the change in drug2 pharmacokinetic . 
these alteration in drug1 pharmacokinetic produce by drug2 explain the increase in serum drug3 level that have be observe when this drug combination have be use clinically . 
activation of a effector immediate-early gene arc by drug1 . 
as immediate-early gene -lrb- ieg -rrb- be think to play a critical role in mediate stimulus-induced neural plasticity , ieg response induce by drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- have be characterize to define the change in gene expression that may underlie its long-lasting behavioral effect . 
although activation of several transcription factor ieg have be describe , little be know about effector ieg . 
here , we have examine whether drug1 administration affect expression of a effector IEG arc -lrb- activity-regulated , cytoskeleton-associated -rrb- that encode a protein with homology to spectrin . 
use in situ hybridization , we observe that drug1 cause a rapid and transient dose-dependent increase in arc mrna level in the striatum and cortex that be abolish by pretreatment with the specific dopamine d1 receptor antagonist drug2 but not by a drug3 drug4 . 
drug1 induce arc mrna in layer iv and VI of the cortex which dopamine receptor be localized to . 
these result suggest that d1 receptor be couple to activation of arc gene , which may be involve in functional or structural alteration underlie neural plasticity trigger by drug1 . 
differential action of intrathecal drug1 on block the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 in rat . 
in the present study , it be propose that the drug1 apply to supraspinal brain site produce they analgesic effect by the activation of different descend pain inhibitory system . 
the blockade of the spinal endorphinergic system by intrathecal drug1 on the production of tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 be then study . 
intraventricular injection of drug1 and drug2 produce a inhibition of the tail-flick response to the heat stimulus in rat . 
intrathecal injection of drug1 at dose of 0.4 to 40 microgram cause a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induce by intraventricular injection of drug2 , and a high dose of drug3 -lrb- 40 microgram -rrb- completely block the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug4 -lrb- 16 microgram -rrb- . 
on the other hand , intrathecal drug1 -lrb- 12-120 microgram -rrb- have only a very weak effect on the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 -lrb- 40 microgram -rrb- . 
intraventricular injection of drug1 at dose of 1.2 to 12 microgram equally antagonize in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induce by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 . 
the result indicate that a spinal drug1 - sensitive endorphinergic system be involve in the production of drug2 but not drug3 - induce tail-flick inhibition , and suggest that intraventricular drug4 and drug5 elicit they pharmacological action via the activation of different descend pain inhibitory system ; 
descend epsilon and mu system for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , be propose . 
pharmacological treatment of depression : the role of drug1 . 
depression be reach epidemic proportion in the western world . 
with each successive generation more people be become more severely depress at a younger age . 
drug interaction : how to identify they . 
interaction between theraputic agent have be recognize as increasingly important cause of drug at they usual recommend dose may , under certain condition , produce toxicity of life-endangering proportion . 
while the recognition of drug toxicity result from interaction be of importance to all physciain , it be especially so for the clinician responsible for the welfare of those in the aerospace environment . 
this paper attempt to provide a basis for the understanding and identification of important drug interaction . 
guideline be provide to assist the clinician in he logical approach to the identification of drug interaction when serious drug toxicity be encounter in a pateint . 
only with knowledge of the interaction can the therapeutic regimen be alter so as to provide therapeutic level of necessary drug while avoid toxicity . 
change in urinary homocysteine follow drug1 and drug2 administration to rat . 
the present work involve the administration of both drug1 and drug2 to group of rat , follow by determination of the homocysteine excretion rate in urine . 
the result indicate that a statistically significant difference exist between the excreted level of homocysteine in the urine of both control and drug1 - treat rat and the level show by rat treat with drug2 . 
the implication of these result be discuss , especially with respect to observation which indicate that homocysteine may be a precipitate factor in the development of thrombosis . 
also include in this paper be a study which confirm the identity of the hplc peak as be homocysteine by form a radioactive derivative of this particular sulphydryl-containing amino acid , and then analyse the result mixture by tlc . 
effect of drug1 and drug2 on the antinociceptive effect of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 in mouse . 
the influence of drug1 and drug2 on antinociceptive effect of drug3 -lrb- 10 mg/kg -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- 500 mg/kg -rrb- and drug5 -lrb- 10 mg/kg -rrb- be investigate in a mouse model use the tail-flick and hot-plate test . 
all drug be inject intraperitoneally . 
drug1 be administer to mouse 30 min before apply the drug2 . 
measurement of nociception be perform within 2 h after drug1 administration . 
drug1 at dose of 0.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg inject with drug2 be find to decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug3 . 
similarly , drug1 decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug2 -lrb- only in the tail-flick test -rrb- and drug3 . 
drug1 use at dose of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug2 , drug3 -lrb- only in the tail-flick test -rrb- and drug4 . 
-lsb- the effect of drug1 on the renal excretion of drug2 and drug3 in dog -rsb- the intravenous injection of drug4 in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhance drug5 and drug6 excretion in chronic canine experiment . 
the higher drug1 and drug2 excretion be due to they increase renal tubular secretion . 
in dog , drug1 unchanged the secretion of drug2 , a test agent for anionic transport . 
possible extrarenal mechanism of action of drug1 on drug2 and drug3 transport be also examine . 
differential regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cell by drug1 , a homodimeric disintegrin , and monomeric disintegrin drug2 and drug3 . 
the homodimeric disintegrin drug1 be compare directly to the monomeric disintegrin drug2 and drug3 for the ability to affect protein tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cell . 
it be observe that drug1 have a dramatic effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of several protein in t24 human bladder cancer cell , include robust induction of phosphorylation of protein in the range of 120-140 kda . 
drug1 alone have no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in t24 cell , but dose-dependently inhibit the effect of drug2 when both be add simultaneously . 
among the protein that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to drug1 treatment be CAS , a 130 kda adapter protein involve in integrin signaling . 
drug1 alone be find to have no effect on CAS , but can completely block drug2 - induce phosphorylation of this protein in mda-mb-435 cell . 
these observation strongly suggest that the homodimeric structure of drug1 functionally distinguish it from other monomeric member of the disintegrin family . 
toxicity of cadmium and drug1 to miracidia of schistosoma mansonus . 
the specific objective of this study be to elucidate metal toxicity to hatching , survival and avoidance behaviour of schistosoma mansoni miracidia . 
the toxicity of cadmium , drug1 , and cadmium/zinc mixture at concentration range from 10000 to 10 microg/l be investigate . 
metal mixture toxicity investigation be undertake with equal concentration of the metal . 
the hatching of miracidia from egg be inhibit by concentration of 1000-10000 microg/l of single metal . 
metal mixture have no effect on drug1 hatching . 
survival of miracidia be reduce by increase metal concentration except at concentration of 10 microg/l for single metal toxicity where survival be increase above the control . 
Miracidia demonstrate a rapid avoidance behaviour when briefly expose to heavy metal . 
the mechanism of metal toxicity to miracidia be briefly discuss . 
drug-lab interaction : implication for nutrition support . 
drug1 interference with urine ketone test . 
it be important that health care professional be aware of the potential for medication to interfere with clinical laboratory test . 
medication can cause in vivo effect when the concentration or activity of the analyte be alter before the analysis and therefore the assay result be true and accurate . 
a in vitro effect occur when the medication interfere with the assay , and the result be erroneous and can not be interpret . 
this report describe a recently identify case of interference of drug1 with the urine test for ketone and demonstrate the importance of a thorough medication review in evaluate abnormal laboratory test . 
-lsb- pharmacologic interaction in chronic treatment : corrective measure for its prevention in a basic area of rural health -rsb- objective : to identify the pharmacological interaction of clinical relevance -lrb- picr -rrb- in the medication authorization card -lrb- MAC -rrb- of the chronically ill and to establish strategy to minimise they appearance . 
design : cross-sectional descriptive study . 
SETTING : Rural primary care centre . 
patient : Random sample of 626 MAC out of a total of 1306 . 
measurement and main result : in December 1998 , the following be gather for every MAC with more than one drug treatment : age , sex , number of drug , intrinsic value , drug prescribe , daily dose and pharmacological interaction -lrb- pi -rrb- , classify -lrb- use the scale of Hansten 1996 -rrb- into light and clinically relevant . 
statistical analysis : Mantel-Haenszel -lrb- alpha = 0.05 -rrb- . 
patient ' mean age be 69.1 -lrb- 95 % ci , + / - 1.2 -rrb- . 
mean number of drug per MAC be 4 -lrb- 95 % ci , + / - 0.2 -rrb- . 
341 pi affect 197 patient -lrb- 31.5 % , 95 % ci , + / - 3.6 -rrb- be identify .

the existence of pi be relate to the number of drug prescribe to each patient -lrb- p < 0.01 -rrb- . 
there be 26 pi with drug of low intrinsic value -lrb- 7.6 % ; 95 % ci , + / - 2.8 -rrb- . 
74.1 % -lrb- 95 % ci , + / - 9.3 -rrb- of the total picr could be avoid by simple recommendation ; 
and the remain 25.9 % -lrb- 95 % ci , + / - 9.3 -rrb- by monitor and follow-up of patient . 
conclusion : it be important to identify the medication most commonly involve in the picr so as to establish corrective measure to minimise the risk arise from multiple medication . 
four educational message advise on over 60 % of the picr detect . 
neurochemical and functional consequence follow drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and drug3 . 
the neurochemical and functional consequence follow drug1 administration to the rat be evaluate and compare to similar effect follow drug2 administration . 
it be observe that drug1 induce long lasting depletion of striatal dopamine concentration and this neurotoxic effect could be prevent by drug2 pretreatment . 
the drug1 - induce neuronal damage produce a tolerance to the disruptive effect of drug2 and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effect of drug3 in rat respond in a schedule control paradigm . 
drug1 , like drug2 , produce depletion of striatal dopamine but these action be potentiate by drug3 pretreatment . 
these observation be discuss in reference to possible deleterious effect follow the administration of drug1 to patient with Parkinson 's disease . 
response to drug1 of the perfused pancreas of the genetically diabetic chinese hamster . 
Nonketotic , genetically diabetic cinese hamster show subnormal pancreatic insulin release and impaired suppression of glucagon in response to glucose . 
to study the pancreatic effect of other agent , dynamic insulin and glucagon release be measure from the in vitro perfused pancreas of normal and diabetic chinese hamster in response to various combination of drug1 -lrb- 20mm -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 100 or 150 mg . per 100 ml . -rrb- , and drug3 -lrb- 10 mm -rrb- . 
drug1 alone cause identical insulin and glucagon release in diabetic and normal . 
drug1 , alone and in the presence of drug2 , cause subnormal insulin release and less suppression of glucagon release in the diabectic than in the normal . 
drug1 , in the presence of drug2 and drug3 , cause excessive glucagon release but nearly normal insulin release in the diabetic . 
drug1 , in the absence of drug2 or drug3 , cause excessive glucagon release in the diabetic and undetectable insulin release in either diabetic or normal . 
pancreatic content after perfusion do not correlate with release during perfusion . 
infusion of drug1 alone markedly decrease the amount of extractable pancreatic insulin and glucagon . 
these result indicate that the pancreatic alpha cell of the diabetic chinese hamster respond excessively to drug1 , as be see in the human diabetic . 
this defect be not relate to acute insulin release or the presence of drug1 . 
further , these result confirm that the diabetic chinese hamster 's alpha and beta cell respond normally to drug1 , but be relatively insensitive to drug2 . 
interference of biocytin with drug1 - evoke hyperpolarization and membrane property of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neuron . 
in we laboratory , preliminary whole-cell , tight seal recording of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neuron include biocytin in the patch pipette yield a significantly smaller proportion of neuron hyperpolarize by drug1 compare with recording without biocytin . 
therefore , we investigate the effect of biocytin inclusion on drug1 response and other membrane property during whole-cell , tight seal recording of these neuron . 
the percentage of neuron hyperpolarize by drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 be significantly reduce when 1 % but not < 
or = 0.2 % biocytin be include in the recording pipette , compare with neuron record without biocytin . 
however , a significantly higher proportion of neuron fire spontaneous action potential with either 0.05-0 .2 or 1 % biocytin compare to no biocytin . 
rest membrane potential , input impedance and the proportion of neuron display transient outward rectification be each significantly alter for neuron record with 1 % but not 0.05-0 .2 % biocytin . 
these effect may be due to a relatively specific blockade of diverse potassium channel type . 
because efficient labeling can be achieve with 0.1 % biocytin with whole-cell recording , higher concentration be contraindicate . 
drug1 : in vitro evaluation of its permeation enhance effect on peptide drug . 
the purpose of this study be to evaluate the effect of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- conjugate on the intestinal permeation of drug5 -lrb- drug6 -rrb- and model peptide drug , drug7 and drug8 . 
drug1 be covalently link to carbodiimide activate drug2 . 
iodometric titration of the polymer conjugate be use to determine the extent of immobilise drug1 . 
permeation study be perform on guinea pig small intestinal mucosa mount in ussing-type chamber . 
unmodified drug1 -lrb- 1 % m/v -rrb- significantly improve the transport ratio -lrb- r = p -lrb- app -rrb- polymer / p -lrb- app -rrb- control -rrb- of drug2 to 1.3 and 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- drug3 conjugate with drug4 further enhance the permeation . 
drug1 conjugation at 3.6 , 5.3 and 7.3 % -lrb- m/m -rrb- result in r-value of 1.4 , 1.7 and 1.8 , respectively . 
decrease the concentration of drug1 , exhibit 7.3 % -lrb- m/m -rrb- of immobilise drug2 -lrb- cmc-cys7 .3 -rrb- from 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- to 0.5 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- decrease the r-value of drug3 from 1.8 to 1.2 . 
drug1 at 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- in the presence of free drug2 have no significant effect on the r-value of drug3 compare to drug4 alone . 
Formulation of fluorescence label drug1 and drug2 in unconjugated drug3 -lrb- 1 % m/v -rrb- do not significantly improve the permeation , however in the presence of 1 % -lrb- m/v -rrb- drug4 7.3 a significantly improve permeation be observe -lrb- r = 1.3 -rrb- . 
conjugation at drug1 with drug2 moiety significantly improve the intestinal permeation of the hydrophilic molecule drug3 and the model peptide drug drug4 and drug5 in vitro , therefore this conjugate system maybe useful for peroral administration of peptide drug in the future . 
effect of low temperature on microtubule in the non-myelinated axon of post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve . 
the effect of temperature change on the number of microtubule in non-myelinated axon have be study in cat inferior mesenteric ganglion/hypogastric nerve preparation incubate at various temperature in Eagles minimal essential tissue culture medium in vitro . 
at 37 degree c the non-myelinated axon contain 28.4 plus or minus 0.8 s.e.m. 
-lrb- 54 -rrb- microtubule per axon . 
after incubation at 0 degree c for 4 h this number fall to 2.3 plus or minus 0.1 s.e.m. 
-lrb- 41 -rrb- but return to normal level when the nerve be rewarm . 
this loss of microtubule on cool the nerve and they reappearance on rewarm be a rapid process ; 
it be independent of the influence of the nueronal cell body and of protein synthesis within the axon . 
the preservation of the microtubule be improve when d2o be present in the incubation medium . 
Reformed microtubule appear to function normally with respect to they possible role in the transport of noradrenaline storage vesicle along the axon . 
the drug1 for urinary tract infection : a review . 
the drug1 be a rapidly grow class of drug2 with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive aerobic bacterium . 
these agent , include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , have be extensively study and have demonstrate efficacy and safety profile comparable to those of other traditional agent for the treatment of complicated or uncomplicated urinary tract infection and prostatitis . 
advantage offer by this class of drug1 include optimal pharmacokinetic , effectiveness against multidrug-resistant organism , and oral administration even when parenteral drug2 be generally use . 
the drug1 be also extensively use in urologic surgery . 
if take 1 hour before drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , drug3 do not affect drug4 exposure , despite persistent buffering effect . 
concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 significantly reduce the level of exposure to drug3 , but it be unclear how soon after drug4 administration drug5 may be give safely . 
we compare drug1 pharmacokinetic and gastric ph in 12 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient by use of 800 mg of drug2 alone versus 800 mg of drug3 administer 1 h after drug4 administration . 
median gastric ph be significantly higher when drug1 be take after drug2 administration ; 
however , no significant difference in the maximum concentration in plasma or the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 h be observe . 
drug1 may be take with a light meal 1 h follow the administration of 400 mg of drug2 . 
progestin-only oral contraception : a comprehensive review . 
in order to provide information for the appropriate package insert labeling of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- in the US , a comprehensive review be make of drug3 -lrb- 0.075 mg -rrb- and drug4 -lrb- 0.35 mg -rrb- , with the clinical difference indicate where applicable . 
the goal of this review be to cite primary source for virtually all research specific to pop since 1975 . 
conclusion and the type of study which support these conclusion be give for each major section .

information on precaution and contraindication , indication , use instruction , and instruction for appropriate action after miss a pill be append . 
Hypothermia as a index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction in the rat . 
decrease core temperature in female rat be investigate as one possible index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction -lrb- der -rrb- . 
core temperature be decrease in rat in a dose-dependent manner when drug1 be administer to rat treat with drug2 8 hour before the drug3 challenge . 
the decrease in temperature begin within 20 minute after drug1 administration , reach a maximal decrease between 60 and 120 minute post drug2 . 
the core temperature return to normal 300 minute after drug1 . 
the blood pressure -lrb- carotid cannulation -rrb- decrease along with the core temperature . 
maximal hypotension be find 120 minute post drug1 , and return to normal 300 minute after drug2 . 
Heart rate increase initially and return to normal 40 minute after drug1 challenge . 
intestinal absorption of drug1 in the chick . 
the intestinal absorption of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- have be investigate in the chick by means of the in situ ligate duodenal loop technique . 
by this procedure , it be observe that drug1 be rapidly and essentially completely absorb -lrb- 80-95 % -rrb- from the lumen at drug2 concentration up to 5 mm , decline to about 50 % absorption at 50 mm . 
transfer from the intestinal lumen to the mucosal cell at low drug1 concentration -lrb- 0.1 mm -rrb- be rapid , while transfer from the mucosal cell to the body occur more slowly . 
at stable drug1 concentration greater than 1 mm , fractional mucosal cell accumulation of drug2 remain constant , while fractional transfer to the body decline . 
however , total mucosal accumulation of drug1 and that transfer to the body increase in a linear logarithmic fashion from 0.05 to 5 mm drug2 . 
the result indicate that drug1 readily penetrate both the mucosal and serosal surface of the epithelial membrane . 
furthermore , drug1 and drug2 do not appear to share a common transport pathway in the duodenum and no evidence be obtain for any interaction between the two at this level . 
drug1 administration to rachitic chick be effective in significantly elevate duodenal drug2 absorption , act primarily to enhance serosal transport . 
drug1 : a update review of its use in the management of schizophrenia . 
drug1 , a drug2 , be a drug3 which have prove efficacy against the positive and negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
compare with drug1 , it have greater affinity for serotonin 5-ht2a than for dopamine d2 receptor . 
in large , well controlled trial in patient with schizophrenia or related psychosis , drug1 5 to 20 mg/day be significantly superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day in overall improvement in psychopathology rating scale and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptom , and be comparable in effect on positive psychotic symptom . 
the 1-year risk of relapse -lrb- rehospitalisation -rrb- be significantly lower with drug1 than with drug2 treatment . 
in the first double-blind comparative study -lrb- 28-week -rrb- of drug1 and drug2 , drug3 10 to 20 mg/day prove to be significantly more effective than drug4 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptom but not on overall psychopathology symptom . 
in contrast , preliminary result from a 8-week controlled study suggest drug1 2 to 6 mg/day be superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptom -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- , although consistent with the first study , both agent demonstrate similar efficacy on measure of overall psychopathology . 
Improvements in general cognitive function see with drug1 treatment in a 1-year controlled study of patient with early-phase schizophrenia , be significantly greater than change see with either drug2 or drug3 . 
however , preliminary result from a 8-week trial show comparable cognitive enhancing effect of drug1 and drug2 treatment in patient with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder . 
several study indicate that drug1 have benefit against symptom of aggression and agitation , while other study strongly support the effectiveness of drug2 in the treatment of depressive symptomatology . 
drug1 be associate with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptom than drug2 and drug3 . 
in addition , drug1 be not associate with a risk of agranulocytosis as see with drug2 or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as see with drug3 or prolongation of the QT interval . 
the most common adverse effect report with drug1 be bodyweight gain , somnolence , dizziness , anticholinergic effect -lrb- constipation and dry mouth -rrb- and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation . 
in comparison with drug1 , the adverse event report significantly more frequently with drug2 in > or = 3.5 % of patient be dry mouth , bodyweight gain and increase appetite and compare with drug3 , only bodyweight gain occur significantly more frequently with drug4 . 
the high acquisition cost of drug1 be offset by reduction in other treatment cost -lrb- inpatient and/or outpatient service -rrb- of schizophrenia . 
pharmacoeconomic analysis indicate that drug1 do not significantly increase , and may even decrease , the overall direct treatment cost of schizophrenia , compare with drug2 . 
compare with drug1 , drug2 have also be report to decrease overall treatment cost , despite the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug . 
drug1 treatment improve quality of life in patient with schizophrenia and related psychosis to a greater extent than drug2 , and to broadly the same extent as drug3 . 
conclusion : drug1 demonstrate superior antipsychotic efficacy compare with drug2 in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia , and in the treatment of some patient with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia . 
the reduce risk of adverse event and therapeutic superiority compare with drug1 and drug2 in the treatment of negative and depressive symptom support the choice of drug3 as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response . 
antimicrobial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with some drug2 . 
antimicrobial activity of drug1 -lrb- the aqueous extract from the carpophore of ganoderma lucidum -lrb- fr -rrb- karst -rrb- be test in vitro against gram positive and gram negative bacterium by serial broth dilution method , and the antimicrobial activity be express by minimal inhibitory concentration -lrb- mic -rrb- . 
among fifteen species of bacterium test , the antimicrobial activity of drug1 be the most potent against Micrococcus luteus -lrb- mic , 0.75 mg/ml -rrb- . 
to investigate the effect of antimicrobial combination of drug1 with four kind of drug2 -lrb- drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 -rrb- , the fractional inhibitory concentration index -lrb- fici -rrb- be determine by checkerboard assay for each strain . 
the antimicrobial combination of drug1 with four drug2 result in additive effect in most instance , synergism in two instance , and antagonism in two instance . 
synergism be observe when drug1 be combine with drug2 against bacillus subtilis and klebsiella oxytoca . 
drug1 protect mouse tumour and normal tissue from the toxicity of oral drug2 . 
because the drug1 drug2 be give exclusively by the oral route in man , we have carry out study in mouse on the antitumour activity , acute toxicity and pharmacokinetic of oral drug3 , either alone or in combination with the chemosensitizer drug4 . 
in both plasma and kht tumour the peak concentration and `` early '' 
auc for total drug1 be about 1.4-1 .5 fold greater for the oral compare to the i.p. 
route . 
these difference be reflect in the roughly twofold greater antitumour activity for the oral route . 
in contrast , acute toxicity test show that oral drug1 be 1.45 time less toxic to normal tissue , although the dose-limiting organ may be different for the two route . 
drug1 reduce the antitumour activity of oral drug2 by dose modifying factor -lrb- dmf -rrb- of 0.58-0 .71 . 
similarly , the acute toxicity be also diminish by a dmf of 0.74 . 
drug1 have a complex effect on oral drug2 pharmacokinetic . 
the plasma and tumour total drug1 peak concentration be reduce by 1.5 and 1.7 fold respectively . 
drug1 also reduce the `` early '' 
drug1 auc , with the extent of the reduction depend on the minimum effective concentration -lrb- mec -rrb- choose . 
for example , the plasma drug1 auc be reduce by factor of 1.05 and 9.6 for mec value of 1 and 2 microgram ml-1 respectively . 
we propose these pharmacokinetic change to be the underlie mechanism for the reduction of oral drug1 cytotoxicity by drug2 . 
clinical trial of such combination should be accompany by detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation . 
pharmacokinetic interaction between single oral dose of drug1 and drug2 in healthy volunteer . 
aim and background : the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 , a drug2 metabolize by cyp3a4 , and the drug3 drug4 be study in 18 healthy subject . 
several clinically important interaction have previously be report for other drug1 that be metabolize by the same enzyme and for drug2 . 
method : healthy subject who be 20 to 43 year old participate in a open , three-period , randomize , crossover study of the pharmacokinetic of a single 10-mg oral dose of drug1 , a single oral 120-mg dose of drug2 , and the two drug give together . 
the three study period be separate by a 21-day washout phase . 
result : the geometric mean -lrb- 90 % confidence interval -rrb- whole blood drug1 area under the plasma concentration time-curve increase 60 % -lrb- 35 % -90 % -rrb- , from 736 to 1178 ng x h/ml , and maximum concentration increase 43 % -lrb- 14 % -81 % -rrb- , from 67 to 96 ng/ml , with drug2 coadministration , whereas the mean elimination half-life of drug3 decrease slightly , from 79 to 67 hour . 
apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of drug1 decrease with 38 % and 45 % , respectively , when drug2 be give with drug3 . 
the plasma maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 be unchanged after coadministration of drug4 , and no potentiation of the effect of drug5 on diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameter be see . 
conclusion : single-dose drug1 coadministration lead to higher drug2 exposure , presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of drug3 . 
because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the drug1 - drug2 interaction , whole blood drug3 concentration should be monitor closely in patient treat with the two drug . 
drug1 , a trans-3 ,4 - dimethyl-4 - -lrb- 3-hydroxyphenyl -rrb- piperidine , prevent gastrointestinal effect of intravenous drug2 without affect analgesia . 
drug1 be a novel drug2 that may selectively prevent drug3 - induce gastrointestinal effect without reverse analgesia . 
gastrointestinal transit time -lrb- lactulose hydrogen breath test -rrb- be measure in 14 volunteer with oral and intravenous placebo , oral placebo and intravenous drug1 -lrb- 0.05 mg x kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- , and oral drug2 -lrb- 4 mg -rrb- and intravenous drug3 -lrb- 0.05 mg x kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- in a double blind , cross-over study . 
drug1 prolong gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minute -lrb- p = .005 -rrb- ; 
drug1 prolong gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minute -lrb- p = .005 -rrb- ; this be prevent by drug2 -lrb- p = .004 -rrb- . 
postoperatively , 45 patient be randomly assign in a double-blind fashion to receive drug1 -lrb- 4 mg -rrb- or placebo and intravenous drug2 -lrb- 0.15 mg/kg -rrb- or to receive oral and intravenous placebo . 
Analgesia and pupil constriction be measure . 
drug1 analgesia and pupil constriction be unaffected by drug2 and differ from placebo -lrb- p < .002 -rrb- . 
we conclude that drug1 prevent drug2 - induce increase in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affect central opioid analgesia . 
the effect of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 on bar-press behavior in normal and genetically nervous dog . 
study on two strain of pointer dog have demonstrate that administration of a drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- facilitate acquisition of goal-directed behavior in `` genetically nervous '' 
subject . 
continue admistration of the drug be require to maintain barpress response in this strain of dog . 
the concomitant administration of either drug1 or drug2 , compound which inhibit neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine , disrupt the behavioral response of the genetically nervous e-strain subject to a far greater extent than the stable a-strain subject . 
it be also show that after 14 day of daily administration of drug1 , withdrawal of the drug not only re-result in almost complete loss of bar-press response in the e-strain subject but also result in a temporary decrease in the acquire behavioral response of the stable a-strain subject . 
therapeutic drug monitoring can avoid iatrogenic alteration cause by drug1 -lrb- mdp -rrb- - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 be a drug2 use to treat a wide variety of infection cause by gram-negative organism , but it be potentially toxic to the kidney . 
due to its nephrotoxicity , drug1 may cause abnormal renal uptake to be see on drug2 bone scintigraphy . 
the presence of the drug1 in the kidney , along with a increase in renal retention , tend to produce scintigraphic result that falsely identify characteristic related to disease such as renal vascular , or urinary tract obstruction , and even renal cancer . 
a altered biodistribution may provide misleading information that can either mask or mimic certain disease symptom . 
a method to maximize the therapeutic benefit of drug1 while minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity and the appearance of a hot kidney on scintigraphy be desirable . 
serial pharmacokinetic dosing have be propose as a method to accomplish this goal . 
therapeutic drug monitoring -lrb- tdm -rrb- of drug1 therapy , and bone scintigraphy employ drug2 as the drug3 be carry out in 22 patient . 
the datum present here demonstrate that with serial pharmacokinetic dosing of drug1 , the iatrogenic alteration cause by drug2 therapy can be avoid . 
interaction of drug1 and drug2 in anaesthetised horse . 
evoke hind limb digital extensor tension -lrb- hoof twitch -rrb- be maintain at 40 % of baseline for 1 h by drug1 infusion in 7 horse anaesthetise with drug2 . 
after 1 h , drug1 be discontinue and hoof twitch allow to recover to 75 % . 
drug1 be again give by infusion to maintain 40 % twitch for a second hour , then 2 mg drug2 / kg bwt be give i.v. 
drug1 infusion be continue for a third hour , and then hoof twitch be again allow to recover spontaneously to 75 % . 
drug1 reduce twitch strength from 40 + / - 1 % -lrb- mean + / - sem -rrb- to 29 + / - 4 % within 7.0 + / - 1.5 min -lrb- p = 0.02 -rrb- . 
twitch gradually return to pre - drug1 strength over the course of the next hour . 
recovery of hoof twitch from 50 % to 75 % take 7.7 + / - 0.7 min for drug1 alone and 11.5 + / - 2.7 min for drug2 plus drug3 -lrb- p = 0.03 -rrb- . 
recovery from 50 % twitch to 75 % fade recovery take 13.8 + / - 0.8 min for drug1 alone and 13.7 + / - 1.2 min for drug2 plus drug3 . 
at 75 % recovery of fade , hoof twitch be 87 + / - 3 % for drug1 alone and 82 + / - 4 % for drug2 plus drug3 . 
reversal of the block with drug1 and subsequent recovery of the horse from anaesthesia be uneventful . 
it be conclude that , although drug1 do augment the neuromuscular blockade of drug2 , the effect be minimal . 
diagnostic , treatment and aftercare approach to drug1 abuse . 
the general public feel that drug1 be not particularly dangerous because it do not produce a well define physical dependency and abstinence syndrome . 
however , when addiction be define as compulsion , loss of control and continue use in spite of adverse consequence , drug1 drug hunger can be see as a agent of addictive disease . 
withdrawal from drug1 dependence usually involve depression , anxiety and lethargy . 
these usually clear within a week , leave only the `` drug hunger '' 
to contend with . 
medication be rarely need . 
when drug1 be the primary addiction , after withdrawal the most effective treatment be group therapy with other recover cocaine abuser . 
we incorporate the principle of recovery and define positive and constructive alternative in deal with cocaine hunger . 
recovery program should be flexible and involve individual and family education on recovery and the nature of addictive disease . 
exercise that produce cardiopulmonary stimulation be a helpful means of reduce drug hunger and anxiety during recovery therapy . 
systemic drug1 . 
understand the breadth of systemic drug1 available for use by the dermatologist and they associate side-effect profile and drug interaction allow the clinician to offer patient optimal care in the management of cutaneous infectious disease . 
altered responsiveness to drug1 after exposure to organic lead . 
drug1 be know to effect the functional integrity of the limbic system , particularly the hippocampus , and to alter behavior which be think to be mediate through limbic function . 
organometal also compromise the limbic system and result in deficit in learning and memory . 
since both drug1 and organolead be present in the environment and seem to influence limbic integration , the interaction of these two compound be assess in the present experiment . 
thirty male rat of the fischer-344 strain be divide into three equal group and be give injection of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- -lrb- 8.0 or 17.0 mg/kg/ml sc -rrb- or the saline vehicle . 
fourteen day later , all animal be challenge with a single hypnotic dose of drug1 -lrb- 3.5 g/kg IP -rrb- . 
the 20 % v/v solution of drug1 be prepare in water from a stock solution of 95 % drug2 . 
the latency to loss of the right reflex and duration of sleep time be record while the rat be keep in sound-attenuating chamber . 
the rat treat with the highest dose of drug1 manifest significantly longer latency to lose the right reflex and shorter duration of sleep than do control . 
these result suggest that exposure to environmental drug1 may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of a animal to drug2 . 
evidence for reduction of drug1 uptake site in the fail human heart . 
objective . 
this study investigate the role of neuronal uptake of drug1 -lrb- uptake-1 -rrb- in human heart failure as a local factor for alter concentration of norepinephrine at the cardiac myocyte membrane . 
background . 
several beta-adrenergic neuroeffector defect occur in heart failure . 
whether a alteration in drug1 uptake-1 occur be still unresolved . 
method . 
the role of drug1 uptake-1 be study in electrically stimulate -lrb- 1 hz , 37 degree c -rrb- human ventricular cardiac preparation and isolate myocardial membrane . 
result . 
the effectiveness of drug1 in increase the force of contraction be decrease in relation to the degree of heart failure . 
in contrast , the potency of drug1 be increase in fail heart -lrb- New York Heart Association functional class iv -rrb- in relation to the concentration produce 50 % of the maximal effect -lrb- ec50 -rrb- . 
the ec50 value for drug1 , which be not a substrate for drug2 uptake-1 , be reduce in myocardium in functional class ii to iii and iv compare with those in nonfailing myocardium . 
the uptake inhibitor drug1 and drug2 -lrb- 3 mumol/liter -rrb- potentiate the positive inotropic effect of drug3 in nonfailing myocardium -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- but not in functional class iv myocardium . 
radioligand binding experiment use the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-3 drug1 reveal a significant decrease by approximately 30 % in drug2 uptake-1 carrier density in functional class ii to iii and iv myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- . 
conclusion . 
in human heart failure , there be a presynaptic defect in the sympathetic nervous system , lead to reduce uptake-1 activity . 
this defect in the fail heart can be mimic by the effect of uptake block agent , such as drug1 and drug2 , in the nonfailing heart only . 
compromise drug1 uptake-1 in functional class iv can not be further increase by drug2 and drug3 . 
the pathophysiologic consequence could be a increase synaptic concentration of drug1 predispose to adenylyl cyclase desensitization . 
the mechanism of drug1 - induce vasorelaxation differ in the mesenteric resistance artery of lean and obese rat . 
drug1 have be show to induce vasorelaxation . 
in this study , we investigate the mechanism -lrb- s -rrb- of drug1 - induce vasorelaxation in resistance mesenteric artery from male lean and dietary-induced obese rat . 
compare with lean rat , artery from dietary-obese rat show significant -lrb- p < 0.001 -rrb- endothelial dysfunction , as indicate by a decrease -lrb- > 20 % -rrb- in maximal acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation . 
drug1 -lrb- 5-35 micromol/l -rrb- induce concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric artery preconstrict with drug2 -lrb- 8 micromol/l -rrb- or drug3 -lrb- 125 mmol/l -rrb- from both lean and dietary-obese rat . 
there be no significant difference between the two group , achieve a maximum relaxation of > 95 % at a concentration of 35 micromol/l . 
however , drug1 -lrb- 100 and 300 micromol/l -rrb- do not alter the effect of drug2 on artery from dietary-obese rat , give superimpose concentration-response curve . 
drug1 be also ineffective in alter drug2 activity in artery from both lean and dietary-obese rat . 
in drug1 - precontracted artery from dietary-obese rat , response to drug2 be not attenuate by endothelial denudation , indicate a action independent of the endothelium . 
this study indicate that : -lrb- a -rrb- the maximal effect of drug1 on resistance artery from lean and dietary-obese rat be not effect by endothelial dysfunction , and -lrb- b -rrb- the effect of drug2 in lean animal -lrb- where endothelial function be not impaired -rrb- , but not in dietary-obese rat , be mediate via no . 
drug1 : a iga-binding lectin . 
we previously report that seed of Artocarpus integrifolia -lrb- jackfruit -rrb- contain a lectin , which we call drug1 , that be both a potent t cell mitogen and a apparently t cell-independent activator of human b cell for the secretion of immunoglobulin . 
during the above experiment we note a massive precipitation in cell culture stimulate with greater than or equal to 100 microgram of lectin . 
in this paper , we show that the precipitate be form after the interaction of drug1 and the serum protein add to the culture medium . 
more importantly , we demonstrate that iga be probably the major serum constituent precipitate by the lectin and that no igg or igm can be detect in the precipitate . 
in secretion such as colostrum , iga be the only protein precipitate by drug1 . 
on the basis of this specificity we describe a simple and reliable affinity chromatography procedure for the purification of both human serum and colostrum iga . 
drug1 be a d-gal binding lectin and should be a useful tool for study of serum and secretory iga . 
-lsb- 2 epidemic of arsenical encephalopathy in the treatment of trypanosomiasis , Uganda , 1992-1993 -rsb- since 1988 , the french non-governmental organisation m decin san Fronti re be run a control program of human african trypanosomiasis in the district of Moyo , North-Uganda . 
between 1988 and 1993 , more than 7,000 patient be diagnose and treat . 
since 1988 , it have be note that incidence of drug1 reaction have increase systematically between June and October of each year , indicate strong seasonal variation . 
in 1992 and 1993 , two outbreak of arsenical reactive encephalopathy -lrb- be -rrb- occur in the sleep sickness center of Adjumani . 
the incidence of be suddenly exceed 10 % of the patient treat by drug1 during August 1992 and September 1993 . 
the onset of 80 % of those `` epidemic '' 
case , occur between the 5th and the 11th day of treatment . 
two retrospective study be conduct in 1992 -lrb- 75 case -rrb- and in 1993 -lrb- 51 case -rrb- . 
among the risk factor study , two appear to increase the risk of be : the prescription of drug1 to treat strongyloidiasis during the drug2 cure and the bad general clinical condition of patient . 
these observation suggest that exogenous co-factor could be involve in the occurrence of be . 
recommendation be to avoid administration of diffusible drug1 treatment during the cure , and to improve the general condition of patient before the cure of drug2 . 
behavioral response to repeat drug1 exposure in mouse selectively breed for differential sensitivity to drug2 . 
mouse from the 20th generation of three line divergently select for response to drug1 - induce sedation time -lsb- long-sedation time -lrb- lst -rrb- , short sedation time -lrb- sst -rrb- , and randomly breed control -lrb- rbc -rrb- -rsb- be use to study drug2 - induce behavioral sensitization . 
these line show variable degree of locomotor activity in response to drug1 . 
at a low drug1 dose and long withdrawal period -lrb- 10 mg/kg , twice a day for 5 day follow by a 14-day withdrawal -rrb- , the LST mouse show tolerance development . 
in response to drug1 , the locomotor activity of the SST be not significantly different from the rbc group . 
at a higher dose and a shorter withdrawal period -lrb- 20 mg/kg , daily for 7 day follow by a 3-day withdrawal -rrb- , the SST mouse show behavioral sensitization similar to the rbc mouse , but the lst mouse do not develop sensitization . 
the different response in locomotor activity induce by drug1 suggest that genetic factor may play a role in determine the magnitude of response to this drug . 
dopamine -lrb- da -rrb- level do not differ significantly in either striatum -lrb- str -rrb- or nucleus accumben -lrb- nac -rrb- for the drug1 - treat animal to they corresponding saline-treated control . 
the affinity -lrb- kd -rrb- of d2 in the nac decrease significantly , without change in density -lrb- bmax -rrb- , in the drug1 - treat SST and RBC mouse . 
on the other hand , the density of d2 binding site in the SST and the rbc mouse in the str be significantly increase in drug1 - treated group without change in kd . 
the lst mouse do not show any change in the kd and bmax in either the str or the nac . 
take together , these finding suggest that the change in the kd of d2 in the nac and the bmax of d2 in the str may contribute to the difference in locomotor response to drug1 exposure in these mouse line . 
drug1 inhibit the cyp2c9 catalyze biotransformation of drug2 . 
objective : we objective be to examine the interaction between drug1 and drug2 to confirm that drug3 inhibit cyp2c9 . 
method : the study be carry out as a open , randomize , crossover design with 14 healthy participant . 
in period a , all volunteer take 500 mg of drug1 orally . 
in period b , the volunteer be randomly assign to one of two group . 
each group take either 150 mg or 75 mg of drug1 a day for 5 day -lrb- day -3 to day 2 -rrb- . 
the group then take 500 mg of drug1 as a single dose -lrb- day 0 -rrb- . 
in both period , blood and urine be sample at regular interval . 
plasma be analyze for drug1 , and urine be analyze for drug2 and its two metabolite , drug3 and drug4 by means of hplc . 
result : during treatment with drug1 , there be a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of drug2 , from 845 ml/h to 688 ml/h , among the volunteer who receive 75 mg/d . 
there be a reduction that reach borderline statistical significance in the group that receive 150 mg/d of drug1 . 
the clearance by means of drug1 and drug2 be significantly reduce in both group -lrb- ie , from 901 ml/h to 318 ml/h in the group that receive 150 mg of drug3 per day and from 723 ml/h to 457 ml/h in the group that receive 75 mg of drug4 per day -rrb- . 
thus there be a tendency toward a more pronounced inhibition of the 4-hydroxylation during treatment with 150 mg/d of drug1 compare with 75 mg/d , but the difference be not statistically significant . 
conclusion : drug1 be a moderate inhibitor of cyp2c9 in vivo . 
influence of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism . 
available datum indicate that platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism be important factor in hemostasis and regulation of vascular tone . 
plasma membrane and intracellular mobilization of calcium ion be intimately relate to platelet activation and release of platelet contents . 
Release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid as well as subsequent synthesis and release of vasoconstrictor thromboxane a2 be also regulate by movement of calcium ion . 
adenosine 3 ' :5 ' - cyclic phosphate in turn control level of free calcium ion in platelet and regulate calcium-dependent reaction . 
drug1 , such as drug2 , drug3 and drug4 , inhibit platelet activation in vitro , and decrease platelet adhesion intravascularly . 
these agent have also be show to decrease platelet nucleotide release and thromboxane a2 generation . 
some preliminary datum suggest that drug1 also increase generation of vasodilator and platelet antiaggregant prostacyclin , which could contribute to decrease in platelet function . 
these effect of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism could contribute in part to they efficacy in patient with ischemic heart disease . 
pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular drug in patient with chronic renal disease . 
Cardiovascular disease be a common comorbidity and a major cause of mortality in patient with chronic renal disease . 
drug regimen in patient with cardiovascular disease be frequently complex and can be significantly affect by alteration in renal function . 
in addition , several cardiovascular drug directly affect renal function and the management of patient with renal disease . 
this article review the impact of renal disease on the pharmacokinetic of cardiovascular drug and identify clinically important interaction between these and other drug commonly use in the management of chronic renal disease . 
several class of cardiovascular drug be also discuss in relationship to they differential effect on the management and progression of renal disease . 
influence of drug1 and drug2 on the sensitivity of rat thoracic aorta to drug3 . 
the aim of this study be to investigate the effect of low and high dose of drug1 , and of drug2 on the response to drug3 in rat thoracic aorta . 
two week after bilateral ovariectomy , female rat receive a s.c. 
injection of vehicle -lrb- corn oil , 0.1 ml/day -rrb- , drug1 -lrb- 10 microg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day -rrb- and/or drug2 -lrb- 20 mg/kg/day -rrb- , for eight day . 
on the ninth day , the rat be sacrifice and aortic ring , with or without endothelium , be use to generate concentration-response curve to drug1 . 
aortic ring with intact endothelium from the high-dose -lrb- 4 mg/kg/day -rrb- drug1 group be supersensitive to drug2 compare to the vehicle or low-dose -lrb- 10 microg/kg/day -rrb- estradiol group -lrb- pd2 value = 7.86 + / -0.09 , 7.30 + / -0.11 and 7.35 + / -0.04 , respectively -rrb- . 
endothelium-intact aortic ring from high - drug1 rat be supersensitive to drug2 when compare to vehicle - , drug3 - and drug4 + high - drug5 - treat rat -lrb- pd2 value = 7.77 + / -0.12 , 7.21 + / -0.13 , 6.93 + / -0.04 and 7.22 + / -0.18 , respectively -rrb- . 
there be no significant difference among the pd2 value for drug1 in aortic ring without endothelium . 
both of these effect be endothelium-dependent . 
drug1 and therapeutics . 
two different type of therapy with drug1 be use : physiological oral drug2 supplementation which be totally atoxic since it palliate drug3 deficiency by simply normalize the drug4 intake and pharmacological drug5 therapy which may induce toxicity since it create iatrogenic drug6 overload . 
primary and secondary drug1 deficiency constitute the sole indication of physiological oral drug2 therapy . 
it be therefore necessary to be well acquaint with the clinical and paraclinical pattern of drug1 deficit and to discriminate between drug2 deficiency due to a insufficient drug3 intake which only require oral physiological supplementation and drug4 depletion related to a dysregulation of the control mechanism of drug5 status which require more or less specific regulation of its causal dysregulation . 
physiological oral drug1 load constitute the best tool for diagnosis of drug2 deficiency and the first step of its treatment . 
physiological oral drug1 supplementation -lrb- 5 mg/kg/day -rrb- be easy and can be carry out in the diet or with drug2 s , with practically only one contra-indication : overt renal failure . 
specific and aspecific treatment of drug1 depletion be tricky use for example drug2 , pharmacological dose of drug3 , physiological dose of drug4 and of drug5 . 
in order to use the pharmacological property of induce therapeutic hypermagnesaemia , high oral dose of drug1 -lrb- > 10 mg/kg/day -rrb- be advisable for chronic indication and the parenteral route be suitable for acute indication . 
there be 3 type of indication : specific -lrb- for the treatment of some form of drug1 deficit i.e. acute -rrb- , pharmacological -lrb- i.e. without alteration of drug2 status -rrb- and mixed -- pharmacological and aetiopathogenic -- -lrb- for example complication of chronic alcoholism -rrb- . 
today pharmacological drug1 therapy mainly concern the obstetrical , cardiological and anaesthesiological field . 
the main indication be eclampsia , some dysrhythmia -lrb- torsade de pointe particularly -rrb- and myocardial ischaemia . 
but it be now difficult to situate the exact place of the pharmacological indication of drug1 . 
drug1 infusion can only be envisage in intensive care unit with careful monitoring of pulse , arterial pressure , deep tendon reflex , hourly diuresis , electrocardiogram and respiratory recording . 
high oral drug1 dose besides they laxative action may bring latent complication which may reduce lifespan . 
there may remain some indication of the laxative and antacid property of non soluble drug1 , particularly during intermittent haemodialysis . 
lastly local use of the mucocutaneous and cytoprotective property of drug1 be still valid , in drug2 and for preservation of transplant particularly . 
the effect of drug1 and drug2 upon drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- - induce locomotion and behavioral change in mouse . 
the behavioral change of mouse induce by acute and repeated i.p. 
injection of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- be observe by measure locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior . 
then , the effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor -lrb- mglur -rrb- agonist , drug1 and drug2 , on the above behavioral change induce by drug3 be find . 
the effect of drug1 be very strong and completely depress the drug2 - induce hyperlocomotion . 
the effect of drug1 be not so strong . 
repeated injection of drug1 for 20 day into mouse induce lower locomotor activity than that in acutely inject mouse . 
these behavioral change may be relate with the negative symptom of schizophrenia . 
in order to examine some molecular mechanism of drug1 - induce behavioral change , northern blot analysis of total rna from prefrontal cortical tissue of mouse treat with drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 be carry out . 
lack of a effect of drug1 on the disposition of drug2 and drug3 in hiv-infected patient . 
two study be conduct in hiv-infected subject to assess the potential for drug1 to interact with drug2 and drug3 . 
both study use 12 subject . 
the drug1 study dose subject with 1200 mg/day of drug2 -lrb- n = 7 -rrb- -lrb- later change to 600 mg/day -lsb- n = 5 -rsb- -rrb- for day 8 to 21 of a 21-day course of 100 mg , five times/day of drug3 . 
subject treat with 200 mg of drug1 twice daily for 21 day receive 1200 mg of drug2 or a equivalent amount of placebo/day for day 8 to 21 . 
drug1 plasma and urine sampling be conduct on day 1 , 7 , and 21 for drug2 and on day 7 and 21 for drug3 . 
peripheral mononuclear cell be also collect for quantitation of phosphorylate drug1 . 
drug1 have no significant impact on the cmax and auc of drug2 , although it significantly decrease the drug3 tmax by 44 % and increase the intracellular exposure to phosphorylate drug4 by 110 % . 
drug1 have no significant effect on drug2 pharmacokinetic . 
base on the result of these study , it be conclude that drug1 may be safely coadminister with both drug2 and drug3 . 
clinical implication of drug1 interaction with five drug2 . 
the intensity , uniformity and time course of drug1 interference by drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 be systematically investigate in 16 patient receive drug7 therapy . 
each subject receive a individualized fixed daily dose of drug1 and serve as he own pre - and postsedative treatment control . 
Prothrombin time be measure four time weekly during five long-term experiment . 
anticoagulant inhibition be observe during the administration of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ; 
there be no significant change in prothrombin test result during the trial of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 and drug2 should not be administer to patient receive drug3 . 
the concurrent use of drug from these group be decrease accord to a survey of 200 hospital medical record . 
drug1 and drug2 interact pharmacologically with orally administer drug3 , but the effect be not clinically significant . 
it be conclude that drug1 and drug2 may be administer safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral drug3 therapy . 
interaction of the constituent of alcoholic beverage in the promotion of liver damage . 
Little have be study of the adverse effect of the exposure of the liver to the interaction of drug1 with its congener and drug2 , coexist in the contents of alcoholic beverage . 
twenty four male Wistar rat be divide into four group . 
two group -lrb- sh/da ; sh/fa -rrb- be submit to daily treatment with synthetic hydroalcoholic solution contain drug1 , drug2 , higher drug3 and drug4 in the same proportion as those find in most common distil and ferment alcoholic beverage ; 
the third group -lrb- sh/ea -rrb- be treat with a hydroalcoholic solution of drug1 ; 
the fourth group serve as control and receive a equivalent volume of a isocaloric solution of drug1 . 
all the animal be kill at the end of the 9th week of the experiment . 
the ratio between the liver weight and body weight be find to be lower in the treated animal than in the control group . 
the histology of the liver be alter in the three group which be submit to treatment with the hydroalcoholic solution , with quantitative and qualitative difference between the group . 
these result suggest that the hepatoxicity of drug1 in alcoholic beverage be enhance by interaction with its congener and drug2 ; 
they also suggest that alcoholic beverage be not equivalent in they potential to cause liver damage . 
administration of drug1 prophylaxis . 
successful prophylaxis of manic-depressive disorder require more than the prescription of drug1 . 
the administrative arrangement in a area of Scotland be accompany by a 300 % increase in the frequency of admission for mania , whereas in a area of the West Midlands , a large decrease be achieve . 
effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 in healthy volunteer .

each healthy subject -lrb- n = 10 -rrb- receive drug1 -lrb- 75 mg once daily -rrb- or placebo for 11 day in a double-blind , randomize , balanced , two-period crossover study . 
a single 0.5 mg oral dose of drug1 elixir be administer on the 7th day of each 11-day period . 
each treatment period be separate by 14 to 21 day . 
sample for plasma and urine immunoreactive drug1 concentration be collect through 120 hour follow the drug2 dose . 
no statistically significant difference between treatment group be observe for any of the calculate drug1 pharmacokinetic parameter . 
for drug1 auc -lrb- 0-infinity -rrb- , auc -lrb- 0-24 -rrb- , and Cmax , the geometric mean ratio -lrb- 90 % confidence interval -rrb- for -lrb- drug2 + drug3 / placebo + drug4 -rrb- be 1.04 -lrb- 0.94 , 1.14 -rrb- , 1.02 -lrb- 0.94 , 1.09 -rrb- , and 1.00 -lrb- 0.91 , 1.10 -rrb- , respectively . 
the drug1 median tmax be 0.5 hour for both treatment . 
the harmonic mean elimination half-life be 45.7 and 43.4 hour for drug1 + drug2 and placebo + drug3 treatment , respectively . 
drug1 be eliminate renally . 
the mean -lrb- sd -rrb- cumulative urinary excretion of immunoreactive drug1 after concurrent treatment with drug2 or placebo be 228.2 -lrb- + / - 30.8 -rrb- and 235.1 -lrb- + / - 39.1 -rrb- micrograms/120 hour , respectively . 
transient and minor adverse event occur with similar frequency on placebo and drug1 treatment , and no treatment-related pattern be apparent . 
drug1 do not influence the plasma pharmacokinetic or renal elimination of a single oral dose of drug2 . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and drug3 : comparison of antiaddictive efficacy , toxicity , and mechanism of action . 
drug1 , a novel iboga alkaloid congener , be be develop as a potential treatment for multiple form of drug abuse . 
like drug1 -lrb- 40 mg/kg -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- 40 mg/kg -rrb- decrease the intravenous self-administration of drug3 and drug4 and the oral self-administration of drug5 and drug6 in rat ; 
unlike drug1 , drug2 do not affect respond for a nondrug reinforcer -lrb- water -rrb- . 
both drug1 and drug2 ameliorate drug3 withdrawal sign . 
both drug1 and drug2 decrease extracellular level of dopamine in the nucleus accumben , but only drug3 increase extracellular level of serotonin in the nucleus accumben . 
both drug1 and drug2 block drug3 - induce and drug4 - induce dopamine release in the nucleus accumben ; 
only drug1 enhance drug2 - induce increase in accumbal dopamine . 
both drug1 and drug2 enhance the locomotor and/or stereotypic effect of stimulant . 
drug1 attenuate , but drug2 potentiate , the acute locomotor effect of drug3 ; 
both compound attenuate drug1 - induce locomotion in drug2 - experienced rat . 
drug1 produce whole body tremor and , at high dose -lrb- > or = 100 mg/kg -rrb- , cerebellar damage ; 
drug1 do not produce these effect . 
drug1 , but not drug2 , decrease heart rate at high dose . 
while drug1 and drug2 have similar affinity for kappa opioid and possibly nicotinic receptor , drug3 have much lower affinity than drug4 for nmda and sigma-2 receptor , sodium channel , and the 5-ht transporter . 
both drug1 and drug2 be sequester in fat and , like drug3 , drug4 probably have a active metabolite . 
the datum suggest that drug1 have a narrower spectrum of action and will have a substantially greater therapeutic index than drug2 . 
effect of coadministered drug and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drug to human serum in vitro . 
the effect of coadministered drug and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drug to human serum in vitro be investigate . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 be add to pooled human serum at therapeutic concentration . 
to each preparation be add one additional drug at three concentration range from therapeutic to toxic . 
the follow eight target drug/added drug combination be study : drug1 / drug2 . 
drug1 / drug2 , drug3 / drug4 , drug5 / drug6 , drug7 / drug8 , drug9 / drug10 , drug11 / drug12 , and drug13 / drug14 . 
each serum without the other add drug as well as the serum supplement with the other drug at the three concentration be dialyze against phosphate buffer . 
similarly dialyze be drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 , both alone at therapeutic concentration in serum and with drug4 at three different concentration in serum . 
the percentage of drug binding in each preparation be calculate . 
drug1 diminish the binding of drug2 to human serum by a net change of 5.7 % -lrb- percentage increase in free drug fraction -lsb- fdf -rsb- , 11.0 % -rrb- at 662 micromol/l and by a net change of 7.1 % -lrb- percentage increase in FDF , 13.7 % -rrb- at 1324 micromol/l . 
drug1 decrease the binding of drug2 by a net change of 6.8 % -lrb- percentage increase in FDF , 8.8 % -rrb- at 277.5 micromol/l ; 
drug1 reduce it by a net change of 6.6 % -lrb- percentage increase in FDF , 8.5 % -rrb- at 431 micromol/l . 
drug1 diminish binding of drug2 by a net change of 9.9 % -lrb- percentage increase in FDF , 21.2 % -rrb- at 1732 micromol/l . 
no significant effect be note with other drug combination or with the addition of drug1 . 
coingestion of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 with drug4 , and drug5 with drug6 at high to toxic concentration decrease the binding of the target drug . 
the result increase in free drug concentration may lead to enhance drug effect in vivo . 
effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetic of drug2 . 
the effect of drug1 on the steady-state pharmacokinetic of drug2 be evaluate in a randomize , double-blind study . 
five day of drug1 treatment do not significantly affect steady-state pharmacokinetic variable of drug2 compare with placebo ; 
therefore , the use of drug1 do not necessitate a adjustment in drug2 dose to maintain therapeutic digoxin level . 
acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of drug1 in anhydrous and aqueous drug2 solution . 
the drug1 be a family of drug2 and drug3 . 
when take concurrently with drug1 , a pharmacological interaction may occur , potentiate the central nervous system depression produce by either drug . 
in addition to this pharmacological interaction , this report describe a novel chemical reaction between drug1 -lrb- a drug2 -rrb- and drug3 under acidic condition similar to those find in vivo , result in a 3-ethoxylated product . 
optimal condition , kinetics , equilibrium , and the mechanism of this acid-catalyzed ethanolysis be report . 
the result raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume drug1 and drug2 on a regular basis . 
the acid-catalyzed drug1 - drug reaction be a relatively unexplored area and may alter the pharmacological action of some drug . 
inhibitory effect of drug1 on inositol 1,4 , 5-trisphosphate-induced response in rat megakaryocyte . 
the effect of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- on drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- - induce response be study in rat bone marrow megakaryocyte with the patch-clamp whole-cell recording technique in combination with fura-2 microfluorometry . 
internal application of drug1 -lrb- 100 microm -rrb- increase intracellular ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- concentration -lrb- -lsb- ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- -rrb- and activate the ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- - dependent k -lrb- + -rrb- current . 
administer drug1 together with drug2 -lrb- 100-500 microm -rrb- inhibit insp -lrb- 3 -rrb- - induce response -lrb- both ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- and current response -rrb- in a dose-dependent fashion . 
pretreatment of megakaryocyte with extracellular drug1 -lrb- 50 microm -rrb- also inhibit drug2 - induce response . 
intracellular and extracellular application of drug1 reduce adp-induced increase in -lsb- ca -lrb- 2 + -rrb- -rsb- -lrb- i -rrb- . 
in contrast , in isolate single pancreatic acinar cell , drug1 have no effect on drug2 - induce response . 
take together , these result suggest that the site of the inhibitory action of drug1 be at the insp -lrb- 3 -rrb- receptor , or its closely associated protein . 
in addition , we have show that drug1 be a useful pharmacological tool with which to examine the drug2 - mediated response of megakaryocyte . 
concomitant drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 chemotherapy plus drug5 therapy in patient with human immunodeficiency virus-related , non-hodgkin lymphoma . 
background : the feasibility and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and drug1 therapy -lrb- haart -rrb- be still unknown in patient with human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- - related malignancy . 
to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy plus haart on the clinical course of patient with hiv-related , systemic , non-hodgkin lymphoma -lrb- hiv-nhl -rrb- , the author compare retrospectively a group of 24 patient with hiv-nhl who be treat with the drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -lrb- chop -rrb- chemotherapy regimen plus haart with a group of 80 patient who be treat with chop chemotherapy or a chop-like regimen -lrb- i.e. , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 with drug9 plus drug10 -rrb- without receive drug11 therapy . 
method : all patient be enrol in two sequential trial perform at the Aviano Cancer Center , Italy , from April 1988 to December 1998 . 
HAART be include with combination therapy from January 1997 . 
drug1 regimen consist of two drug2 and one drug3 . 
result : the two treatment group be well match with regard to patient demographic , nhl characteristic , hiv status , and treatment , i.e. , the number of cycle and chemotherapy dose . 
the response rate be similar between the two group . 
severe anemia -lrb- Grade 3-4 accord to the World Health Organization criterion -rrb- be significantly greater in the patient who receive CHOP-HAART compare with the patient who receive chop alone -lrb- 33 % vs. 7 % , respectively ; p = 0.001 -rrb- . 
leukopenia be similar between the two group , but colony stimulating factor support be significantly greater in the CHOP-HAART group than in the control group -lrb- 92 % vs. 66 % , respectively ; p = 0.03 -rrb- . 
seventeen percent of chop-haart patient develop severe autonomic neurotoxicity , whereas none of the chop patient develop neurotoxicity -lrb- p = 0.002 -rrb- . 
at similar median follow-up , opportunistic infection -lrb- oi -rrb- rate and mortality be significantly lower in the chop-haart patient than in the chop patient -lrb- 18 % vs. 52 % , respectively ; p = 0.05 ; and 38 % vs. 85 % , respectively ; p = 0.001 -rrb- . 
the median survival for chop-haart patient be not reach , whereas the medial survival of chop patient be 7 month -lrb- p = 0.03 -rrb- . 
conclusion : the combination of chop plus haart be feasible and may reduce the morbidity from oi in hiv-nhl patient . 
however , careful attention must be direct to cross toxicity and possible pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
the impact of the combined chemotherapy plus haart treatment on patient survival need urgently to be evaluate in prospective study . 
drug1 and drug2 : a drug interaction . 
the drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 be not well know . 
drug1 have be report to increase the drug2 requirement in human subject ingest these agent simultaneously . 
the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 result in the need for a unusually high maintenance dose of drug3 -lrb- 20 mg per day -rrb- in order to produce a therapeutic effect . 
withdrawal of drug1 decrease the drug2 requirement by 50 % . 
this effect may be mediate by the ability of drug1 to induce microsomal enzyme and , thus , the catabolism of drug2 . 
the effect of drug1 on the drug2 requirement of we patient appear to be maximal 5 to 7 day after the initiation of drug3 and extend a similar length of time after drug4 withdrawal . 
this interaction appear to be clinically significant . 
increase stability of nucleophosmin/b23 in anti-apoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
we obtain evidence that increase stability of nucleophosmin/b23 be involve in antiapoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
nucleophosmin/b23 in serum-deprived -lrb- 0 % serum -rrb- nih-3t3 cell be find to be highly unstable with a half-life less than 4 h . 
in contrast , nucleophosmin/b23 in serum-deprived ras-transformed -lrb- ras-3t3 -rrb- cell be as stable as that in serum-supplemented nih-3t3 or ras-3t3 cell . 
treatment of ras-3t3 cell with nucleophosmin/b23 antisense oligomer significantly potentiate the apoptosis induce by serum deprivation . 
much less caspase-3 activity be note in the lysate derive from serum-deprived ras-3t3 cell compare with that in the lysate of serum-deprived nih-3t3 cell . 
cell permeable caspase-3 inhibitor add in the medium block the decrease of nucleophosmin/b23 and apoptosis induce by serum deprivation in nih-3t3 cell . 
the inhibitor , on the other hand , promote significant decrease of nucleolin/c23 in nih-3t3 cell during serum deprivation . 
unlike nucleolin/c23 , down-regulation of nucleophosmin/b23 be thus not proliferation-dependent but caspase-3 - and apoptosis-dependent . 
we result indicate important relationship among ras , nucleophosmin/b23 , activation of caspase-3 , and induction of apoptosis . 
drug1 : mammalian target of drug2 inhibitor to prevent kidney rejection . 
current immunosuppressive therapy be effective but can be associate with significant adverse reaction . 
drug1 work differently from the drug2 currently available , and except for increase lipid level , the adverse reaction profile of drug3 do not appear to overlap to any great extent with that associate with drug4 or drug5 . 
while additional research be need , the initial clinical datum in kidney recipient suggest that drug1 , in combination with drug2 or drug3 , might have the potential to reduce the frequency of rejection episode , permit reduction in drug4 or drug5 dosage , and permit steroid withdrawal -lrb- Kelly , 1999 -rrb- . 
Development and pharmacology of drug1 . 
drug1 be the first drug2 to be approve for clinical use , and have be study extensively in human since 1986 . 
it be structurally distinct from the other currently available drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -rrb- , lead to unique biopharmaceutical property relative to the other agent of this class . 
absorption of drug1 be virtually complete across all species , include man , and be not affect by the presence of food . 
systemic exposure be limit , as drug1 be subject to first-pass metabolism , and the plasma half-life of the drug be approximately 30 minute . 
some 95 % of a single dosage of drug1 be excrete via the biliary route , with less than 2 % of this be the parent compound . 
additionally , there be no evidence of circulate active metabolite or accumulation during chronic dosing . 
study of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic of drug1 have demonstrate marked reduction in the rate of bioavailability -- from 40 % to 60 % ; 
however , a comparison of drug1 administration with the evening meal or at bedtime have reveal no significant difference in the extent of bioavailability -lrb- area under the curve -rrb- of these two regimen . 
furthermore , no significant difference in pharmacodynamic effect -lrb- reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level -rrb- could be ascertain between mealtime dosing and bedtime dosing . 
the pharmacokinetic of drug1 have also be assess in various demographic group . 
relative to the general population , plasma concentration of drug1 do not vary as a function of either age or gender . 
in addition , administration to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency result in a 2.5-fold increase in both the rate and extent of bioavailability relative to control . 
also , although minimal alteration of drug1 clearance in patient with renal insufficiency be anticipate due to limited renal excretion -lrb- 5 % -rrb- , a study in this patient group be currently underway to examine this further . 
interaction study have be perform with drug1 and several drug with which it might be coadminister . 
drug1 , a anionic-binding resin , have a considerable effect in lower the rate and extent of drug2 bioavailability . 
although this effect be note even when drug1 be give 4 hour prior to drug2 , this regimen do not result in diminish efficacy . 
further , no effect on either drug1 level or prothrombin time be observe in a study involve concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 . 
moreover , additional interaction study with drug1 and drug2 have not demonstrate any effect on drug3 plasma level , and administration to a patient population chronically receive drug4 result in no difference in the extent of bioavailability of drug5 relative to control datum . 
the result generate to date in clinical pharmacokinetic study with drug1 thus support its use in a broad population of hypercholesterolaemic patient . 
molecular basis for the selective toxicity of drug1 for yeast and drug2 for animal cell . 
among the drug1 , many , like drug2 , can not be use clinically because they be toxic ; 
drug1 , however , be useful in therapy of human fungal infection because it be less toxic . 
both the toxicity of drug1 and the therapeutic value of drug2 can be rationalize at the cellular and molecular level by the follow observation : -lrb- i -rrb- these drug3 show differential effect on cell ; 
drug1 be more potent in lyse human red blood cell , whereas drug2 be more potent in inhibit yeast cell growth ; 
and -lrb- ii -rrb- the effect of drug1 be more efficiently inhibit by add cholesterol , the major membrane sterol in human cell , whereas the effect of drug2 be more efficiently inhibit by ergosterol , the major membrane sterol in yeast . 
the simplest inference be that the toxicity and effectiveness of polyene be determine by they relative avidity for the predominant sterol in cell membrane . 
-lsb- hippocampus as interaction site between cerebral memory system -rsb- most of the current theory assume that there be multiple form of memory that be support by separate brain system and have different characteristic . 
animal study on the various dual-memory theory have be carry out mainly on the basis of hippocampal system function . 
specifically , they have focus on aspect of learning and memory that be impaired -lrb- vs. spare -rrb- by lesion of the hippocampal formation . 
however , there be several instance in the animal literature show that hippocampal lesion actually produce enhance learning and memory function . 
moreover , the acquisition of task that be facilitate by hippocampal lesion -lrb- or dysfunction -rrb- be nevertheless associate , in intact subject , with specific neurobiological alteration in the hippocampus . 
this problem have be analyse use two different task in mouse : a bar-press conditioning and a spatial discrimination task . 
result show that , depend on the task consider , the same pharmacological treatment produce either a facilitation or a impairment of acquisition . 
moreover , each task induce significant alteration in hippocampal adenylate cyclase activity but in opposite direction . 
together with previous finding , these result suggest that the hippocampus be involve in both the so-called `` hippocampal-dependent '' 
`` hippocampal-independent '' 
form of memory . 
it be postulate that some of the observe training-induced neurobiological alteration might reflect the interaction between two -lrb- or more -rrb- compete memory system at the hippocampal level . 
thus , in addition to its propose specific information processing function -lrb- i.e. , relational -rrb- , the hippocampus would play a role in address information to the brain memory system that , in a give situation , have the best adaptive value . -lrb- abstract truncate at 250 word -rrb- 
behavioral mechanism underlie the link between smoking and drinking . 
many people use both drug1 and drug2 -lrb- i.e. , cigarette and other tobacco product -rrb- . 
the behavioral effect of these two drug differ , and they do not act on the same target site in the brain , although they may share , or partly share , certain property . 
the initiation of drug1 or drug2 use may be precipitate by similar personality characteristic in the user , such as impulsivity and sensation seek . 
moreover , the mechanism underlie the development of dependence may be similar for drug1 and drug2 . 
thus , certain factor , such as reinforce drug effect , conditioning process , automatic behavior , and stress , may influence the development of dependence on both drug . 
other factor , such as tolerance and sensitization to the drug ' action and the development of withdrawal symptom , may also contribute to dependence . 
this review discuss the action of the two drug on certain brain chemical -lrb- i.e. , neurotransmitter -rrb- system and the extent to which the effect of the two drug may interact . 
Vancomycin resistance reversal in enterococci by flavonoid . 
the development of clinical vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococci -lrb- vre -rrb- be a major cause for concern . 
here we show that a combination of drug1 or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone with drug2 may be use to sensitize resistant strain of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to the level of vancomycin-sensitive strain . 
Minimum inhibitory concentration -lrb- mic -rrb- and viable count be determine in iso-sensitest broth use a microtitre method . 
mic of drug1 against 67 % of resistant clinical isolate and a type strain of enterococcus be lower from > 250 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- to 1 
4 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- in the presence of drug1 -lrb- 12.5 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone -lrb- 6.25 microg ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- . 
viable count for type culture E. 
faecalis atcc 51299 show the flavonoid alone significantly lower number of colony form unit -lrb- cfus -rrb- . 
cfus be maintain at low level -lrb- 10 -lrb- 3 -rrb- CFU ml -lrb- -1 -rrb- -rrb- for 24 h by drug1 / flavone combination . 
this combinational action in reverse vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlight novel drug target and have importance in the design of new therapeutic regime against resistant pathogen . 
lack of interaction between drug1 and drug2 : pharmacokinetic and drug disposition . 
previous study have demonstrate a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of drug1 and drug2 when administer concomitantly with a intravenous drug3 such as drug4 . 
this decrease in absorption result in a 36 % and 50 % lower auc for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , which could cause clinical failure . 
the author investigate the possibility of a similar interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
eight healthy volunteer be randomize in a open-label , two-way crossover study to receive drug1 , 5 mg p.o. 
q4h , and drug1 , 500 mg p.o. 
1 hour after start the drug1 or drug2 500 mg p.o. 
alone . 
blood sample be draw at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 , and 24 hour for Cmax , tmax , and auc determination . 
there be not a significant difference -lrb- p > 0.05 -rrb- in auc -lrb- 48.59 + / - 8.52 vs. 49.9 + / - 9.93 -rrb- , cmax -lrb- 7.73 + / - 2.6 vs. 6.6 + / - 2.0 -rrb- , and tmax -lrb- 1.1 + / - 0.6 vs. 1.6 + / - 1.1 -rrb- for drug1 versus drug2 / drug3 regimen . 
it be conclude that oral drug1 and drug2 can be administer concomitantly without a significant decrease in auc , cmax , or tmax . 
the mode of toxic action of the pesticide drug1 : the metabolism of drug2 to drug3 . 
the biochemical toxicology of drug1 , a known metabolite of the major ingredient of the pesticide drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , be investigate in vivo and in vitro . 
rat kidney homogenate supplement with coenzyme a , atp , oxaloacetate , and mg2 + convert drug1 to drug2 in vitro . 
administration of drug1 -lrb- 100 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to rat in vivo result in drug2 synthesis in the kidney , which be precede by a elevation in fluoride level and follow by citrate accumulation . 
animal dose with drug1 do not display the 2-3 hour lag phase in either drug2 synthesis or in citrate and fluoride accumulation characteristic of animal dose with drug3 . 
we demonstrate that the conversion of drug1 to drug2 by a NAD + - dependent oxidation be the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the toxic product , drug3 from drug4 . 
prior administration of drug1 -lrb- 90 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- be show to prevent the conversion of drug2 -lrb- 100 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to drug3 in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevation see in drug4 - intoxicated animal . 
however , administration of drug1 -lrb- 90 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- to rat 2 hour prior to drug2 -lrb- 100 mg kg -lrb- -1 -rrb- body weight -rrb- be ineffective in prevent drug3 synthesis and do not diminish fluoride or citrate accumulation in vivo . 
we conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal property of drug1 see in animal treat with drug2 derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD + - dependent oxidation responsible for convert drug3 to drug4 in the committed step of the toxic pathway . 
drug1 - induce oxidative stress in rat brain and liver be prevent by drug2 or drug3 . 
consider that the involvement of reactive oxygen species -lrb- ros -rrb- have be implicate in the toxicity of various pesticide , this study be design to investigate the possibility of oxidative stress induction by drug1 , a drug2 . 
either single -lrb- 170 mg/kg -rrb- or repeat -lrb- 75 mg/kg per day for 5 day -rrb- oral administration of drug1 be find to produce significant oxidative stress in cerebral and hepatic tissue of rat , as be evident by the elevation of the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance -lrb- tbar -rrb- in both tissue , either 4 or 24 h after treatment . 
much higher change be observe in liver , increase from a level of 60 % at 4 h up to nearly 4 time the control at 24 h for single dose . 
reduce level -lrb- up to 20 % -rrb- of total glutathione -lrb- total gsh -rrb- , and elevation of conjugate diene -lrb- approximately 60 % in liver by single dose at 4 h -rrb- also indicate the presence of a oxidative insult . 
glutathione-s-transferase -lrb- gst -rrb- activity , however , do not differ from control value for any dose or at any time point in cerebral and hepatic tissue . 
pretreatment of rat with drug1 -lrb- 100 mg/kg , ip -rrb- or drug2 -lrb- 100 mg/kg per day , ig , for 3 day and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day -rrb- provide significant protection against the elevation of tbar level in cerebral and hepatic tissue , induce by single high dose of oral drug3 administration within 4 h. 
thus , the result suggest that drug1 exposure of rat result in free radical-mediated tissue damage , as indicate by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation , which be prevent by drug2 and drug3 . 
serum drug1 level use a 125i-labelled antigen : validation of method and observation on cardiac patient . 
1 . 
determination of serum drug1 level utilize commercially available kit with a 125i-labelled antigen be precise and not materially different from result obtain with a 3h-labelled antigen . 
2 . 
in order to approximate the steady state level , serum drug1 level should be draw either before or at least six hour follow the administration of a oral tablet . 
3 . 
concomitantly give drug1 do not interfere with the absorption of a tablet of drug2 . 
4 . 
in the digitalized patient , slow alteration in serum level after oral administration appear well correlate with , at least , the negative chronotropic effect of the drug . 
5 . 
maximal exercise testing , a maneuver often apply to cardiac patient , do not significantly alter the serum drug1 level . 
analysis of drug1 - induce diarrhea in cecectomized rat . 
the drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- - induce diarrhea be analyze in cecectomized rat prepare by resect the cecum and its vasculature without disturb the ileocecal junction . 
drug1 -lrb- 0.1-1 .0 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- 
dose-dependently increase the number of defecation episode and induce a soft and watery stool in cecectomized rat . 
at 0.3 mg/kg , the diarrhea-inducing effect of drug1 be more pronounced in cecectomize than in control rat . 
when give i.p. , drug1 -lrb- 0.3 mg/kg -rrb- induce a watery stool in cecectomize and control rat with the same efficacy , although these effect be short-lasting as compare to oral administration . 
drug1 -lrb- 4 ml/kg , p.o. -rrb- 
also induce diarrhea , but do not produce a watery stool in cecectomized rat . 
there be no difference between cecectomized and control rat in basal small intestinal transit or in drug1 -lrb- 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- - induce enhancement . 
moreover , the basal and drug1 - induce jejunal net fluid transfer be the same in cecectomize and in control rat . 
on the other hand , the enhance secretion of colonic fluid by drug1 , give intraluminally , be only half of that in control rat , whereas the colonic transit-enhancing effect of drug2 in cecectomized rat be more pronounced than in control rat at 15 but not at 30 min after its administration . 
the basal colonic fluid contents and transit be the same in cecectomize and in control rat . 
drug1 and drug2 -lrb- 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- 
drug1 and drug2 -lrb- 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- inhibit the drug3 -lrb- 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. -rrb- - induce diarrhea in cecectomized rat . 
drug1 -lrb- 5 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- 
drug1 -lrb- 5 mg/kg , s.c. -rrb- completely antagonize the inhibitory effect of drug2 and partly antagonize the effect of drug3 . 
these result suggest that oral administration of drug1 induce a more pronounced secretory diarrhea in cecectomize than in control rat , probably due to the lack of the reservoir function of the cecum in the operate animal . 
this secretory diarrhea model be suitable for evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of drug . 
drug1 as potent drug2 of glucocorticoid-induced mouse mammary tumor virus gene expression . 
the effect of natural and synthetic galloyl ester on glucocorticoid-induced gene expression be evaluate by use rat fibroblast 3y1 cell stably transfect with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional regulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus drug1 . 
the glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription be strongly suppress by synthetic alkyl ester ; 
drug1 show the most potent inhibition -lrb- 66 % inhibition at 10 microm -rrb- , which be far more potent than that of crude drug2 . 
n-octyl and n-cetyl gallate also show good inhibition , while gallic acid itself be not so active , suggest that the presence of hydrophobic side chain be important for the suppressive effect . 
on the other hand , surprisingly , drug1 , -lrb- - -rrb- - epigallocatechin-3-o-gallate and theasinensin a , potently enhance the promoter activity -lrb- 182 and 247 % activity at 1 microm , respectively -rrb- . 
the regulation of the level of the glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by the antioxidative gallate be of great interest from a therapeutic point of view . 
high-dose drug1 with drug2 protection . 
nephrotoxicity frequently limit the dose of drug1 to less than 120 mg/m2 per injection . 
drug1 be a neutralize agent for drug2 that protect against renal damage . 
to determine whether injection of drug1 would permit larger dose of drug2 to be administer , a fix 9.9-g / m2 dose of drug3 be give intravenously over three hour concurrently with escalate dose of drug4 . 
drug1 be administer over the last two hour of the drug2 infusion . 
use this technique , it be possible to escalate the drug1 dose to 225 mg/m2 before dose-limiting toxicity be encounter . 
comparison of drug1 pharmacokinetic in patient treat with 202.5 mg/m2 plus drug2 to those in patient treat with 100 mg/m2 without drug3 indicate that there be no change in the elimination rate constant , volume of distribution , or total body clearance of drug4 . 
the total drug exposure for the plasma be approximately twofold at the higher drug1 dose . 
this study demonstrate that concurrent administration of drug1 permit at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to drug2 . 
interaction on the antinociceptive effect between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 . 
the aim of this paper be to study the interaction between drug1 and both drug2 or its synthetic analogue drug3 , or drug4 , on the antinonciceptive effect of these peptide in mouse after intracisternal injection . 
antinociception be measure by the hot-plate method . 
it be show that drug1 antagonize evidently the antinociceptive effect of drug2 and they analogue . 
on the contrary , drug1 and drug2 be agonist in induction of analgesia . 
it be conclude that drug1 modulate in a opposite way the function of the enkephalinergic neuron and the central action of drug2 . 
the emerge role of drug1 in drug2 therapy . 
the availability of potent drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- - base regimen for drug3 therapy and concern regard drug4 -lrb- drug5 -rrb- - related metabolic disturbance have lead to significant shift in treatment practice in hiv infection . 
drug1 - base regimen may have several advantage over drug2 - base therapy for initial or prolonged therapy , include more convenient administration regimen , lower tablet volume , fewer drug interaction , and central nervous system penetration . 
no datum from prospective clinical trial currently exist compare the 3 approve agent -lrb- drug1 , drug2 or drug3 -rrb- . 
both drug1 and drug2 have be compare to triple therapy with the drug3 drug4 over 48 week as initial therapy , with similar response be observe with drug5 regimen and superiority observe with drug6 . 
a smaller 24-week study have suggest drug1 may be superior to the drug2 drug3 . 
limited comparative datum in patient with high viral load treat with drug1 - or drug2 - base regimen currently exist . 
however , cohort datum and select patient datum from clinical trial suggest comparable activity to drug1 - base regimen in these patient . 
the superiority of drug1 over drug2 - base regimen have be observe in comparative datum in a subset of patient with high viral load . 
in treatment-experienced patient , available uncontrolled datum suggest these agent contribute to regimen efficacy in drug1 - na have , treatment-experienced patient . 
drug1 have demonstrate superiority over drug2 in nucleoside-experienced patient , although combine these 2 agent may represent the best approach in these circumstance . 
the tolerability of drug1 appear generally good with few individual discontinue in clinical study as a result of adverse drug event . 
the majority of adverse event with drug1 occur within the first month , and be predictable and manageable without therapy interruption . 
suppression by drug1 of drug2 - enhance peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinoma induce by drug3 in wistar rat . 
background : the effect of combined administration of drug1 and drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , a drug4 , on the incidence of peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinoma induce by drug5 -lrb- drug6 -rrb- and the labeling index of intestinal cancer be investigate in male Wistar rat . 
method : from the beginning of the experiment , rat be give 10 weekly subcutaneous injection of drug1 -lrb- 7.4 mg/kg body weight -rrb- and subcutaneous injection of drug2 -lrb- 40 microg/kg body weight -rrb- every other day , and from week 16 , intraperitoneal injection of drug3 -lrb- 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight -rrb- every other day until the end fo the experiment in week 45 . 
result : drug1 significantly increase the incidence of intestinal tumor and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum . 
although drug1 administer at either dose have little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by drug2 or on the location , histologic type , depth of involvement , label index , apoptotic index or tumor vascularity of intestinal cancer , it significantly decrease the incidence of cancer metastasis . 
drug1 also significantly decrease the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinoma , which be enhance by drug2 . 
conclusion : these finding indicate that drug1 inhibit cancer metastasis through action that do not affect the growth of intestinal cancer . 
-lsb- dose-time effect of competitive displacement of drug1 by drug2 follow oral and intravenous administration -rsb- the effect of various dose of drug3 in several dose fraction on the extent and the time scale of displacement of drug4 , in dependence on application mode , be study . 
a intravenous dose of 50 mg drug1 be in respect of competitive suppression of organ actively concentrate drug2 as effective as intravenous 1000 mg clo-4 - simultaneously or 1000 mg orally 30 min before the injection of drug3 . 
a intravenous injection of drug1 give later also produce a complete and immediately begin depletion of drug2 already accumulate in the thyroid , within a period of 195 min after 99m-tco-4-injection with a corresponding increase in blood level . 
20 mg result in incomplete depletion which become complete after a second additional dose . 
the intravenous application of drug1 offer advantage in clinical use . 
combination of drug1 and drug2 : effect on drug discrimination and behavioral inhibition in rat . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- produce psychotomimetic effect in human that resemble schizophrenia symptom . 
in a effort to screen compound for antipsychotic activity , preclinical researcher have investigate whether these compound block drug1 - induce behavior in animal . 
in the present study , the drug1 drug2 be test in combination with a active dose of drug3 in two-lever drug discrimination and mixed signalled-unsignalled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate -lrb- drl -rrb- procedure . 
drug1 produce distinctive effect in each task : it substitute for the training dose in drug2 discrimination and it increase the number of response with short -lrb- < 3 s -rrb- interresponse time as well as increase overall response rate in the DRL schedule . 
acute dosing with drug1 fail to alter the behavioral effect of drug2 in either procedure even when test up to dose that produce pharmacological effect alone . 
these result suggest that acute dosing with drug1 would not affect behavior most closely associate with drug2 intoxication . 
further , they bring into question the utility of use drug1 combination procedure in animal to screen for antipsychotic potential . 
since chronic dosing be require for therapeutic efficacy of drug1 , future study should focus on investigation of chronic dosing effect of these drug in combination with drug2 . 
-lsb- multiple occupational exposure to solvent -rsb- this article review papers publish over the last 20 year on multiple occupational exposure to solvent . 
at low-level of exposure the toxicokinetic interference between solvent have generally not be observe in man and presumably a threshold limit exist . 
conversely , at exposure level close to the `` limit value '' 
metabolic interference have sometimes be observe and the behaviour of the biological indicator differ from what would be expect . 
toxicodynamic interference between solvent can give rise to additive , potentiation , synergistic , antagonistic effect . 
for the identification of `` limit value '' , it have generally be suggest in the literature that the possible effect derive from multiple exposure be consider as additive . 
however , numerous potentiation effect have frequently be report for combined exposure to substance of widespread use . 
in this paper list of multiple exposure in which the dose of the substance , the type of interference and the behaviour of the biological level have be draw up and propose as a tool for easy consultation .
