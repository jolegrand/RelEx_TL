The effects of concomitant drug1 administration on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 ( ' drug2 ' ) is a newly introduced drug3 with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . 
It is extensively metabolized , predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4 . 
Therefore , concurrent administration of drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme may affect drug1 pharmacokinetics . 
This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer drug1 did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of drug2 , resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , or bipolar disorder . 
These results indicate that dosage adjustment of drug1 may be necessary when the two drugs are given concurrently and that caution may be required when administering other drugs that inhibit or induce cytochromes , particularly P450 3A4 . 
[ Drug treatment of erection disorders in patients with cardiovascular disease ] Erectile dysfunction is a frequent condition in cardiovascular patients . 
Since the arrival of oral drug1 , patients want to know how safe sexual activity is in cardiovascular disease in general and during use of drug2 in particular . 
Sexual intercourse with a steady partner causes no more cardiovascular risk than normal daily activities such as ironing , 2 kilometers of walking without climbing , paperhanging , playing golf or gardening . 
The relative risk of myocardial infarction during sexual activity is not significantly higher than for healthy persons . 
The incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is not higher among users of drug1 . 
drug1 is contraindicated in patients using drug2 or who may need to use drug3 , because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure . 
No interactions have been observed with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 and drug5 . 
Before prescribing a symptomatic ( pharmaceutical ) treatment for patients with an erection disorder , attention should be given tot the sexological , psychological and medical backgrounds of the disorder . 
Secondary prevention of atherosclerotic risk factors is also important : regulation of blood pressure and blood sugar level , hyperlipidaemia and obesity , as well as a change of lifestyle ( giving up smoking , adapting of diet and more physical exertion ) . 
Patients with a very low cardiac capacity should be advised to refrain from treatment of the erection disorder . 
Failure of drug1 to modify drug2 induced hypertension in sheep . 
Studies in rats have shown that drug1 administration attenuates certain types of drug2 dependent hypertension , including drug3 hypertension . 
The effects of oral drug1 on drug2 induced hypertension were examined in conscious sheep . 
drug1 has no effect on the blood pressure or metabolic responses to drug2 in sheep . 
Pharmacokinetic Interaction between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 in healthy males . 
The objective of this study was to determine if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction when drug1 is given with drug2 or drug3 and to determine the effects of these drugs on the erythromycin breath test ( ERMBT ) . 
Twenty-four healthy male subjects were randomized to one of two cohorts . 
All subjects received drug1 ( 1,200 mg twice a day ) for 4 days , followed by a 7-day washout period , followed by either drug2 ( 300 mg once a day [ QD ] ) ( cohort 1 ) or drug3 ( 600 mg QD ) ( cohort 2 ) for 14 days . 
Cohort 1 then received drug1 plus drug2 for 10 days , and cohort 2 received drug3 plus drug4 for 4 days . 
Serial plasma and urine samples for measurement of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 and their drug4 , were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography . 
drug1 did not significantly affect drug2 's pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state ( AUC ( ss ) ) of drug2 by 2.93-fold and the AUC ( ss ) of drug3 by 13.3-fold . 
drug1 significantly decreased the AUC ( ss ) of drug2 by 82 % , but drug3 had no effect on drug4 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 decreased the results of the ERMBT by 83 % . 
The results of the ERMBT after 2 weeks of drug1 and drug2 therapy were increased 187 and 156 % , respectively . 
drug1 plus drug2 was well tolerated . 
drug1 plus drug2 was poorly tolerated , and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy . 
drug1 markedly increases the metabolic clearance of drug2 , and coadministration is contraindicated . 
drug1 significantly decreases clearance of drug2 and drug3 , and the combination is poorly tolerated . 
drug1 inhibits the ERMBT , and drug2 and drug3 are equipotent inducers of the ERMBT . 
[ The effect of drug1 on the activity of mixed-function mono-oxidases in the liver microsomes ] The effects of the drug2 -- the drug drug3 -- on hepatic microsomal monooxygenase activities were studied . 
The agent was found to produce some inhibiting activity against hepatic microsomal 7-ethoxycoumarine deethylase in male Wistar rats in vitro and in vivo experiments . 
When given in a dose of 50 mg/kg , drug1 produced no statistically significant effect on the duration of hexanal-induced sleep in mice . 
The findings suggest that the agent has slight effects on the tested activities . 
Repeated oral administration of drug1 in sheep : interactions of drug2 with drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Interactions between treatments with drug1 , drug2 ( an drug3 ) , drug4 ( an drug5 ) , and drug6 ( an inducer of microsomal enzymes ) were investigated in sheep . 
A daily dose of 2 mg of drug1 / kg of body weight for 6 days did not affect the plasma enzymes or the antiprothrombinemic effect of drug2 in wethers . 
The treatment of ewes with an intravenous ( IV ) injection of drug1 , insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity , appeared to produce additive effects with those produced by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of drug2 / kg/day . 
In ewes given 40 mg of drug1 / kg for 5 days intraperitoneally ( IP ) , the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of drug2 / kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present . 
Treatment with daily doses of 2 mg of drug1 / kg for 6 days did not modify the anticholinesterase effect of a 2nd series of treatments given 6 weeks later . 
Pharmacokinetic profile of drug1 in special populations . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 in healthy normal volunteers has been extensively studied and is well described . 
drug1 is characterised by a high oral bioavailability , low clearance , a small volume of distribution , and a 7-hour half-life . 
It is essentially completely metabolised , therefore little is excreted unchanged . 
drug1 is highly protein bound . 
To investigate the effect of disease states or concomitant drug administration on a patient 's response to drug1 , additional pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in special populations . 
Since drug1 has a well-defined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship , measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters is clinically relevant . 
Data from studies to date show that disease states , underlying conditions , and concomitantly administered highly protein-bound drugs have essentially no effect on drug1 pharmacokinetics . 
Therefore , drug1 can generally be given without the need for dosage modifications in special populations such as uncompromised elderly patients , those with moderate renal impairment , and patients with stable hepatic disease . 
Enhanced drug1 clearance secondary to drug2 therapy . 
This report describes two cases in which drug1 clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant drug2 administration . 
Maximum calculated drug1 clearance ranged from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 times baseline . 
Onset of the interaction began within five days of beginning concurrent therapy . 
With combined use , clinicians should be aware , when drug1 is added , of the potential for reexacerbation of pulmonary symptomatology due to lowered serum drug2 concentrations . 
In vitro activity of drug1 , either singly or in combination with drug2 , against Mycobacterium ulcerans . 
The antimicrobial effect of a drug1 , drug2 , either alone or in combination with drug3 , was evaluated in vitro against two type strains and six clinical isolates of Mycobacterium ulcerans . 
Growth of M. 
ulcerans was measured by plate counts and the BACTEC radiometric method . 
The minimal inhibitory concentration as well as minimal bactericidal concentration of drug1 against M. 
ulcerans was between 0.012 and 0.025 mg/l , while corresponding values for drug1 and drug2 were in the range of 0.1-0 .8 mg/l and 0.1-0 .4 mg/l respectively . 
When combined with drug1 , drug2 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of drug3 ( or drug4 ) and drug5 . 
These results suggest that drug1 has a great potential in the treatment of M. 
ulcerans infection . 
Pharmacokinetics of drug1 . 
Effective use of drugs in therapy depends not only on clinical acumen but also on the availability of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data . 
Such information assists in development of safe dosing regimens , prediction of abnormal handling of drugs in states of disease and disorder and anticipation of drug interactions . 
For the drug1 now available in the United States ( drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ) , these data appeared well after clinical patterns of use evolved . 
Nonetheless , their relevance continues to be demonstrated by the dependence of each agent on intact liver blood flow and function for normal rates of elimination ; 
by the nonlinear kinetic characteristics for drug1 and drug2 ( and probably for drug3 , as well ) and the derivative implications for decreased dosing frequency requirements ; 
and by observations now appearing on the relation between plasma drug levels and drug effects , both therapeutic and toxic . 
Such data are discussed herein , with emphasis on those aspects that impact on the clinical use of the drug1 . 
Herbal remedies , nephropathies , and renal disease . 
The use of herbal remedies is becoming increasingly popular in the United States . 
Research has shown that herbal remedy use may be associated with acute renal failure . 
In addition , the use of herbal remedies may be detrimental for the patient with compromised renal function . 
Patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure may be at risk for further kidney damage as well as complications related to interactions of herbal remedies with complex renal therapy regimens . 
This article will describe the escalating use of herbal therapy and the hazards of herbal remedy use among patients . 
drug1 and their complications . 
Drugs that suppress the immune system are widely used . 
They are part of the treatment of patients with organ transplants , malignancy , and increasingly those with conditions such as psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , and liver and bowel disease in which inflammation is an aetiological factor . 
Because of the broadening indications for drug1 , and the prolonged survival in conditions for which they are being used , many patients on immunosuppression are now cared for in the community or seen in non-specialist hospitals , usually in close collaboration with a specialist . 
This article looks at five commonly used drug1 in turn ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) , discussing the main , non-infection , unwanted effects , ways to avoid them and what to do if problems arise . 
The management of infection is dealt with as a separate section . 
drug1 and drug2 similarly inhibit and stimulate drug3 - or drug4 - induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium . 
Prostatic epithelium proliferates in a defined medium consisting of basal medium RPMI1640 containing drug1 ( 1 microgram/ml ) , drug2 ( 10 ng/ml ) , and drug3 ( 3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 IU/ml ) . 
Although neither drug1 nor drug2 affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing drug3 alone , they modify the mitogenic effect of drug4 and drug5 . 
drug1 at 10 ( -10 ) M or drug2 at about 3 X 10 ( -9 ) M inhibits proliferation stimulated by drug3 . 
Higher concentrations of drug1 ( 10 ( -8 ) - 10 ( -6 ) M ) or drug2 ( 3 X 10 ( -8 ) - 10 ( -7 ) M ) enhance the mitogenic activity of drug3 . 
drug1 had a similar effect in the presence of drug2 . 
However , drug1 stimulated , but did not significantly inhibit , proliferation in the presence of drug2 . 
These results suggest that both drug1 and drug2 , and possibly other drug3 and drug4 , may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of drug5 and drug6 . 
Death in drug1 users : causes and rates . 
The world medical literature contains 43 reports of deaths associated with drug1 in a 35-year period . 
These included seven cerebrovascular accidents , six sudden cardiac deaths , three cases of hyperpyrexia , eight poisonings of uncertain mechanism and seven cases of medical complications of intravenous injection ; 
the remainder were of uncertain cause . 
In contrast , in Ontario alone , in 1972 and 1973 there were 26 deaths in drug1 users , of which 16 were due to accident suicide or homicide . 
Of the remaining cases , two were cardiac , two hepatic and the rest were mixed drug overdose . 
Pulmonary granulomata , subacute hepatitis and other lesions resulting from intravenous drug use were common findings at autopsy . 
On the basis of the estimated number of regular users of intravenous drug1 in Ontario , the mortality rate in such users is at least four times as high as in the general population of the same age , and is comparable to that in alcoholics and drug2 addicts . 
However , the absolute number of drug1 - related deaths is far greater than the number of deaths in drug2 or drug3 users . 
[ A pharmacological analysis of the effect of drug1 on stimulated gastric secretion ] Chronic experiments on dogs with gastric fistulas were carried out to study the influence of drug2 and drug3 on drug4 - and drug5 - induced gastric acid secretion . 
It was established that both angiotensins inhibited gastric acid secretion stimulated by drug1 but not by drug2 . 
Comparative analysis of the effects of stimulation and inhibition of cholino - and adrenoreceptors on this inhibitory action of drug1 suggested the mediation of drug2 influence through the modulation of cholinergic reactions of parietal cells in the stomach . 
[ Stimulation by drug1 -- an analog of the octapeptide cholecystokinin -- of drug2 binding after the long-term administration of drug3 ] It has been established in experiments on white male rats that prolonged administration ( twice a day for 14 days ) of drug4 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) and drug5 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) resulted in the reduced interaction between drug6 and low affinity binding sites for drug7 in subcortical structures , whereas drug8 binding with high affinity binding sites for drug9 increased both in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures of the forebrain . 
After prolonged administration of drug1 the displacing effect of drug2 , an analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide , was replaced by the stimulant action on drug3 binding . 
It is assumed that increased interaction between drug1 and high affinity binding sites for drug2 on dopamine2 - and serotonin2-receptors underlies the antipsychotic action of drug3 after their prolonged administration . 
Cholecystokinin octapeptide is a necessary factor for realization of this action of drug1 . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in rats . 
The interaction of intramuscularly injected drug1 and its N-demethylated metabolite ( metabolite I ) with drug2 was evaluated in rats . 
Five , 10 , 20 , or 50 mg/kg of drug1 alone or 20 , 50 , or 100 mg/kg of metabolite I alone produced less than 10 minutes of hypnosis . 
However , drug1 anesthetic requirement ( i.e. , MAC ) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56 % 1-2 hours and as much as 14 % 5-6 hours after injection of drug2 , 50 mg/kg , im . 
The reduction in MAC was correlated with brain levels of drug1 or metabolite I , suggesting a drug2 : metabolite I potency ration of 3:1 . 
The half-life of drug1 in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of drug2 than when drug3 was given alone . 
It is concluded that drug1 is not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with drug2 would be expected to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system . 
In vitro interaction of drug1 and drug2 in placental vessels . 
The interaction of drug1 and synthetic drug2 on placental vessels was studied in vitro . 
Resistance was measured near the placental margin after spontaneous term delivery . 
In seven experiments reactions to drug1 and drug2 were drug3 . 
drug1 produced significantly increased vasoconstriction after a single administration of drug2 . 
In eight experiments the perfusion medium contained drug1 . 
There was no change after a single dose of drug1 . 
The reaction after drug1 remained the same in both groups of experiments . 
There is thus an enhancement effect 
There is thus an enhancement effect of drug1 upon the reaction of placental vessels to drug2 in vitro . 
Note : dissolution of aerosol particles of drug1 in drug2 , a model drug3 . 
The effect of a drug1 extract from bovine lung , drug2 , on the dissolution rate of aerosol particles of drug3 was determined . 
Aerosol particles of drug1 were generated from an drug2 solution , dried , and collected by a cascade impactor for characterization or by a liquid impinger for dissolution experiments . 
Powder x-ray diffraction , differential scanning calorimetry , differential thermal analysis , and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the aerosol particles and starting material . 
No change in phase was detected , although the aerosol particles appeared to contain residual drug1 . 
The dissolution rate of the aerosol particles in saline was low and variable . 
drug1 increased the extent of dissolution of drug2 in proportion to the added concentration , which was also verified by equilibrium solubilization studies . 
drug1 also increased rate of dissolution , in a manner similar to drug2 . 
Analysis of the concentration of drug1 following ultracentrifugation indicated that there is rapid equilibration of drug2 between the drug3 and aqueous phase . 
These results show that drug1 has the potential of enhancing the rate and extent of dissolution of drugs administered to the lung . 
Anaesthesia and the epileptic pateint . 
A review . 
A review is presented of some of the problems that may arise in association with anaesthesia for epileptic patients . 
There is the possibility of precipitating anticonvulsant drug toxicity . 
Numerous drug interactions are possible with some drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , which affect hepatic microsomal enzyme systems . 
There is the risk of convulsions occurring in susceptible patients following the use of the new drug1 which are capable of inducing CNS excitability . 
Interaction between drug1 and drug2 in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryos . 
In this study we investigated whether also drug1 fulfils the function as co-activator in glutamatergic activation of NMDA receptors in the neuronal apparatus of spontaneous motility in chick embryos . 
The successive application of drug1 ( 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight ( e.w. ) 
and drug1 ( 15 mg/kg e.w. ) 
The successive application of drug1 ( 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight ( e.w. ) and drug2 ( 15 mg/kg e.w. ) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of drug3 alone . 
This effect did not depend on the order of application of the drugs . 
In 13-day-old embryos , drug1 was ineffective in both doses . 
It is concluded from these results that the modulatory effect of drug1 is evidently a later developmental acquisition ( after day 15 of incubation ) in the embryogenesis of NMDA-ergic activation of spontaneous motility in chick embryos similarly as glycinergic inhibition . 
Acute effect of different drug1 on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
Diabetic patients have a 20 % higher risk of depression than the general population . 
Treatment with drug1 can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with drug2 . 
The treatment of depression in diabetic patients must take into account variations of glycemic levels at different times and a comparison of the available drug1 is important . 
In the present study we evaluated the interference of drug1 with blood glucose levels of diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
In a first experiment , male adult Wistar rats were fasted for 12 h. 
drug1 ( 5 mg/kg ) , drug2 ( 30 mg/kg ) , drug3 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) , drug4 ( 20 mg/kg ) drug5 ( 30 mg/kg ) or vehicle was administered . 
After 30 min , fasting glycemia was measured . 
An oral drug1 overload of 1 ml of a 50 % drug2 solution was given to rats and blood glucose was determined after 30 , 60 and 90 min . 
drug1 and drug2 did not change fasting or overload glycemia . 
drug1 and drug2 increased blood drug3 at different times after the glucose overload . 
drug1 neutralized the increase of glycemia induced by oral drug2 overload . 
In the second experiment , non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were fasted , and the same procedures were followed for estimation of drug1 tolerance 30 min after drug2 overload . 
Again , drug1 neutralized the increase in glycemia after drug2 overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
These data raise the question of whether drug1 is the best choice for prolonged use for diabetic individuals , because of its antihyperglycemic effects . 
drug1 would be useful in cases with potential risk of hypoglycemia . 
drug1 promotes the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the microsomal fraction of rat liver and it enhances the effects of oleate in this respect . 
drug1 ( 0.5-2 mM ) promoted the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction in a cell-free system derived from rat liver . 
By contrast , drug1 ( 1 mM ) and drug2 ( 1 mM ) had no significant effect on the translocation when added alone . 
drug1 , and to a lesser extent , drug2 , enhanced the translocating action of oleate and increased its effectiveness in transferring the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction . 
It is proposed that the phosphohydrolase becomes metabolically active when it combines with membranes and that polyamines might help to regulate this interaction . 
This could facilitate the action of fatty acids and enable cells to increase their capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis to match an increased availability of fatty acids . 
The effects of drug1 and of drug2 anesthesia on drug3 tolerance in dogs . 
In a comparison of drug1 tolerance in dogs anesthetized with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 , the dosage of drug5 needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher , as was the LD50 of drug6 , with drug7 or drug8 than with drug9 . 
Ventricular tachycardia induced by drug1 was generally converted to sinus rhythm following administration of drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 but not after administration of drug5 alone or after drug6 . 
Excretion of thioethers in urine after exposure to electrophilic chemicals . 
Electrophilic agents -- a class of chemicals that includes most genotoxic compounds -- can be inactivated by reaction with glutathione or other SH-bearing molecules . 
The conjugates so formed often appear in the urine as mercapturic acids or other thioether products . 
This paper critically reviews the suitability of the urinary thioether assay as a method for the detection of exposure to electrophilic agents or their precursors . 
In practice , the greatest value of the thioether assay appears to lie in its signal function . 
This is demonstrated for cigarette smokers and industrial workers involved in chemical waste incineration . 
Whenever increased thioether excretion is observed , it is likely to be due to exposure to one or more suspect compounds . 
However , when the thioether concentration ranges within the limits of the normal value , one must not conclude that there is no , or negligible , exposure . 
More specific applications of the assay of thio compounds in urine allow development of selective methods that may be useful for biological monitoring . 
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to a drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of rhabdomyolysis resulting from concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 . 
CASE SUMMARY : A 64-year-old African-American man was admitted to the hospital for worsening renal failure , elevated creatine phosphokinase , diffuse muscle pain , and severe muscle weakness . 
About three weeks prior to admission , the patient was started on drug1 for sinusitis . 
The patient had been receiving drug1 for approximately six months . 
He was treated aggressively with intravenous hydration , drug1 , and hemodialysis . 
A muscle biopsy revealed necrotizing myopathy secondary to a toxin . 
The patient continued to receive intermittent hemodialysis until his death from infectious complications that occurred three months after admission . 
There were several factors that could have increased his risk for developing rhabdomyolysis , including chronic renal failure . 
DISCUSSION : drug1 is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , the major enzyme responsible for drug2 metabolism . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and other drug2 have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis . 
Other factors may increase the risk of this drug interaction , including the administration of other medications that are associated with myopathy , underlying renal insufficiency , and administration of high doses of drug1 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 inhibit the metabolism of drug2 that are metabolized by CYP3A4 ( i.e. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) . 
This interaction may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis , particularly in patients with renal insufficiency or those who are concurrently taking medications associated with myopathy . 
Optimal designs for the individual and joint exposure general logistic regression models . 
Interest in administering compounds in combination lies both in enhancing efficacious effects and in limiting adverse effects . 
Although much statistical work has focused on developing mathematical functions to model the joint dose-response curves , relatively little work exists in regard to designing experiments for assessing joint action . 
A variety of parametric dose-response models based on either the normal or logistic probability distribution have been proposed in the literature . 
These models are typically nonlinear in the parameters , and as such , a nonlinear weighted least squares approach can be employed for the purpose of designing experiments . 
The approach is applicable across a wide variety of settings commonly associated with joint action data , including continuous and discrete responses , alternative error structures , and nonzero background response . 
Further , designs can be expressed in terms of proportionate responses associated with the individual compounds rather than dose levels , thereby providing for results that are applicable across compounds . 
As a precursor to this effort , optimal and minimal experimental designs for the case in which a single compound is administered have also been developed . 
Although the proposed methodology for deriving experimental designs can be applied to any nonlinear regression model , primary focus is given to the additive and nonadditive independent joint action ( IJA ) models for individual and combined exposures proposed by Barton , Braunberg , and Friedman ( 1 ) . 
[ The GABA-ergic system and brain edema ] It has been shown in rats with experimental toxic and traumatic edemas that drug1 ( 1 mg/kg ) removes the antiedematous action of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 and reduces the action of drug6 . 
When the dose of drug1 is minimized to 0.5 mg/kg such an effect is not observed . 
Prolonged daily administration of drug1 in a dose of 1 mg/kg results in the development of brain edema . 
It is recommended that GABA-positive drugs be included into a complex of treatment measures for edema . 
New oral therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus : The drug1 or insulin sensitizers . 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing problem not only in the United States but also across the world . 
There is now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complications of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy . 
Ultimately however , up to 80 % of type 2 diabetics die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease . 
This increased incidence of atherosclerotic disease is intricately associated with insulin resistance , which is a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 2 diabetes . 
There is strong evidence that insulin resistance is involved in the development of not only hyperglycemia , but also dyslipidemia , hypertension , hypercoagulation , vasculopathy , and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . 
This cluster of metabolic abnormalities has been termed the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
The drug1 ( drug2 and drug3 ) , a new class of oral drug4 , are `` insulin sensitizers '' 
and exert direct effects on the mechanisms of insulin resistance . 
These effects not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduced insulin requirements , but also have potentially favorable effects on other components of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
Long-term studies are needed to determine whether the insulin-sensitizing effects of the drug1 can prevent or delay premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , morbidity , and death . 
Effect of drug1 on the apparent volume of distribution and elimination of drug2 . 
According to Gibaldi et al. . 
( 1968 , 1970 ) , the higher serum concentrations of drug1 and drug2 reached after administration of drug3 are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body . 
To determine whether drug1 has a direct effect on the distribution of drug2 , the elimination and distribution of drug3 was studied in six patients , five lacking kidney function and one with a partially impaired renal function , in the presence or absence of drug4 . 
No significant difference was found between the mean values of the volume of distribution of drug1 with and without drug2 ( 13.0 and 12.6 liters , respectively ) . 
Thus , the hypothesis of Gibaldi et al. . 
could not be confirmed for drug1 in patients lacking kidney function . 
In spite of the absence of kidney function , the value of the elimination rate constant was significantly decreased in the presence of drug1 ( from 0.326 to 0.263 / h ) . 
This might be explained by a blockade by drug1 of the elimination of drug2 by the liver . 
Stereoselective behavioral effects of drug1 in pigeons and squirrel monkeys . 
The behavioral effects of the stereoisomers of drug1 ( drug2 ) were compared with those of drug3 ( drug4 ) in pigeons and squirrel monkeys responding under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio ( FI FR ) schedule of food presentation . 
Intermediate doses of drug1 or drug2 produced transient increases in FI responding in monkeys and sustained increases in FI responding in pigeons ; 
higher doses decreased FI and FR responding in both species . 
In contrast to its enantiomer , drug1 failed to increase FI responding significantly in either species ; 
at high doses , drug1 decreased FI and FR responding . 
In monkeys , drug1 was about 10 times more potent than drug2 in decreasing responding , whereas in pigeons drug3 was about equipotent with drug4 . 
In both species , drug1 , but not drug2 , antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of drug3 on FI and FR responding . 
In monkeys , the effects of drug1 , but not drug2 or drug3 , were antagonized by drug4 ; 
the doses of drug1 required to antagonize the effects of drug2 were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of drug3 . 
In pigeons , drug1 did not systematically alter the effects of drug2 , drug3 or drug4 . 
drug1 reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either drug2 or drug3 in pigeons , but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of drug4 . 
The results demonstrate a high degree of stereoselectivity in the behavioral effects of drug1 . 
The levorotatory isomer had opioid-antagonist and non-opioid agonist effects in pigeons and mixed opioid agonist-antagonist effects in monkeys . 
The dextrorotatory isomer , on the other hand , had effects similar to those of drug1 in both species . 
Cancer in the elderly : basic science and clinical aspects . 
The incidence of cancer increases progressively with age . 
Rearrangements of genomes have been found to accompany cellular aging . 
These factors , in concert with age-dependent alterations in immune function and host defense , may help to explain the increased risk of malignant disease in aged persons . 
The clinical presentation and natural history of neoplasia are also affected by aging . 
This conference reviews recent developments in these areas , examines the effects of drug use in the elderly and implications for management , and discusses current information on how age may influence the response of cancer to therapy . 
Prescribing . 
Keys to maximizing benefit while avoiding adverse drug effects . 
When prescribing for older patients , some physicians are overly cautious , and this strategy can result in a less than optimal treatment outcome . 
The reluctance to treat aggressively is understandable because the geriatric population is susceptible to adverse drug reactions . 
The key to maximizing therapy lies in individualizing it as much as possible . 
There are a number of steps physicians can take to ensure that their patients are not being undertreated . 
These steps include regular reevaluations of dosages and plasma drug concentrations , recognition and understanding of drug side effects , and avoidance of certain agents . 
Close monitoring allows physicians to minimize risks , maximize benefits , and get the most out of what modern medications can do to help older patients . 
Determinants of cellular sensitivity to drug1 . 
It is now clear that topoisomerase activity level is an important determinant of sensitivity to topo drugs . 
The regulation of topoisomerases is no doubt complex and multifaceted and is probably accomplished through redundancy at many control levels . 
The mechanism ( s ) of altered topo I expression in certain tumor types is unknown , but may be related to the central importance of topoisomerases in proliferating cell functions ( transcription , replication , etc. ) , and the aberrant and chronic activation of these functions as a result of specific tumorigenic alterations . 
Small differences in sensitivity to chemotherapy can have a dramatic effect on cure rates , and therefore subtle cell type-specific differences may be important determinants of drug sensitivity . 
Whether abnormal topoisomerase quantity and specific activity are associated with resistance or sensitivity to topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy in the clinic is now being studied . 
Determinants downstream of cleavable complex formation that affect the sensitivity of tumor versus normal cells to topo drugs in particular and DNA-damaging agents in general are little known . 
The goal of enhancing selective tumor cell killing relative to the normal cells that are dose limiting may be achieved either by overcoming tumor cell resistance or by protecting normal cells . 
Both of these strategies will become more feasible as specific molecular differences between tumor and normal cells are being rapidly identified and new combination therapies that take advantage of these differences are being designed and tested . 
Interactions of drug1 and drug2 in absorption and retention . 
The effects of supplementary oral drug1 and drug2 , as well as the interaction between both at the absorption site , fecal and urinary excretion as well as the retention of these trace elements were determined by using four diets containing either 9 or 63 micrograms/kg of drug3 and 48 or 446 mg/kg of drug4 over a period of 19 days in a total of 24 rats . 
Retention was calculated by the balance technique and by the comparative slaughter technique . 
After one day , fecal as well as urinary excretion of both elements had already responded to the dietary treatments , with constant values being reached after approximately three days . 
drug1 excretion was enhanced by supplementary drug2 ; 
fecal excretion , too , was increased by supplementary drug1 ; 
whereas urinary excretion was decreased in both cases . 
Additional drug1 significantly inhibited the absorption of drug2 in both dietary drug3 treatments . 
The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg drug1 instead of 48 mg of drug2 per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of drug3 . 
Consequently , the effect of drug1 on the retention of drug2 was lower than on absorption . 
This suggests that interactions between the two elements only take place at the site of absorption . 
Because of the low dietary drug1 concentration as compared to the drug2 contents of the diets , no effect of drug3 on drug4 absorption and excretion occurred . 
Differences in drug1 balance were only observed between both dietary concentrations , showing a higher absolute but a lower relative absorption as well as retention in the groups fed further drug2 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
[ Importance of pharmacogenetics ] Pharmacogenetics deals with the differences in effect of drugs caused by genetic variation . 
Differences can occur in therapeutic effect and in adverse events . 
Genetic variation in metabolism may result in high concentrations of drugs and an increased risk of adverse effects in slow metabolizers , which is important when using for example drug1 or chemotherapy . 
Genetic variation also occurs in proteins interacting with drugs , which may change the effect of e.g. 
asthma drugs and drug1 . 
The selection of drugs and their dosages may be improved , and the number of adverse effects reduced by pharmacogenetic investigations . 
However , it may be important also in case of medical examinations for insurances and job appointments , since some patients may turn out to need expensive drugs or to be susceptible to a certain disease . 
Therefore , the use of genetic data in these instances has to be regulated . 
drug1 overdose recognized by a drug2 assay . 
Altered mental status in an adolescent presents a diagnostic challenge , and the clinician depends on clinical evaluation and laboratory studies to determine therapy and prognosis . 
We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by drug1 overdose with a positive drug2 level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of drug3 with a toxicology screen for drug4 . 
drug1 . 
Treatment plans for patients taking drug1 can become complicated . 
drug1 predispose a patient to bleeding problems . 
Many drugs used in dentistry can not be taken concomitantly with these medications . 
Acute drug1 administration does not affect subjective responses to drug2 in humans . 
RATIONALE : Stress and drug1 facilitate and reinstate psychostimulant self-administration in rodents . 
However , the effects of stress and drug1 on the subjective and behavioral effects of drug2 have not been well studied in humans . 
OBJECTIVES : To examine the effects of acute drug1 pretreatment on the subjective and behavioral effects of drug2 . 
METHODS : drug1 ( 100 mg ) and drug2 ( 20 mg ) were administered orally to 16 healthy male and female volunteers in a four-session , placebo-controlled , within-subject , crossover design . 
To prevent stomach irritation , subjects received drug1 before each experimental session . 
Dependent measures included self-reported mood and subjective effects ( Addiction Research Center inventory , the profile of mood states , and a series of visual analogue scales ) , vital signs , salivary cortisol , and psychomotor performance . 
RESULTS : drug1 elevated salivary cortisol levels , produced modest dysphoria , and reduced subjects ' reports of wanting more drug . 
However , drug1 pretreatment did not affect any of the physiological , behavioral , or subjective effects of drug2 . 
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the effects of drug1 in rodent studies , these results indicate that an acute increase in cortisol does not enhance the psychostimulant effects of drug2 in humans . 
Effect of drug1 on drug2 - induced changes in steroid hormone levels and lethality in male rats . 
We examined the effect of exogenous drug1 on the changes in serum steroid hormone levels induced by a nonlethal dose of Escherichia coli drug2 in male rats and the deaths due to nonlethal and lethal doses of drug3 . 
Injection of drug1 5 min before a nonlethal dose of drug2 changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to drug3 . 
The serum estrogen concentrations of drug1 + drug2 - treated rats decreased by 50 % , while those of the drug3 - treated rats increased ( 2 - to 5-fold ) . 
The serum androgen concentrations of drug1 + drug2 - treated rats did not change significantly , while those of drug3 - treated rats dropped to 30-40 % 
0.001 . 
Exogenous drug1 also appeared to influence the percentage of drug2 - induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner . 
It reduced the number of deaths induced by nonlethal ( 2 mg/kg ) dose of drug1 but increased the number of deaths induced by a highly lethal dose ( 8 mg/kg ) . 
These results , together with the known relationships between drug1 and the immune response , suggest that drug2 affect the course of septic shock in a complex fashion and may have either protective or deleterious effect . 
Studies on the mechanism of action of drug1 : effect of drug2 on respiration and cell permeability of Candida albicans . 
The drug1 , drug2 , inhibits the growth of several species of Candida . 
Candida albicans , one of the pathogenic species , was totally inhibited at a concentration of approximately 10 mug/ml . 
Endogenous respiration was unaffected by the drug at a concentration as high as 100 mug/ml , whereas exogenous respiration was markedly sensitive and inhibited to an extent of 85 % . 
The permeability of the cell membrane was changed as evidenced by the leakage of 260-nm absorbing materials , amino acids , proteins , and inorganic cations . 
The results we present clearly show that the drug alters the cellular permeability , and thus the exogenous respiration becomes sensitive to the drug . 
Interferon induction : tool for establishing interactions among homopolyribonucleotides . 
Hitherto unrecognized interactions between homopolyribonucleotides and complexes thereof are suggested by interferon induction data obtained in a highly sensitive assay system of primary rabbit kidney cell cultures superinduced by metabolic inhibitors . 
drug1 : a therapeutic update . 
BACKGROUND : Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998 , drug1 has been used by millions of men for the treatment of erectile dysfunction . 
Recent studies and consensus reports have expanded our understanding of its efficacy , safety , contraindications , and drug interactions . 
OBJECTIVE : This paper reviews recent studies of the efficacy of drug1 , its adverse effects and drug interactions , and socioeconomic factors involved in its use , with a focus on specific patient populations ( prostate cancer , diabetes mellitus , ischemic heart disease , spinal cord injuries , neurologic disorders ) . 
METHODS : Clinical studies , case reports , and commentaries and editorials concerning drug1 published in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE , PREMEDLINE , and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts , using the terms drug2 , drug3 , and erectile dysfunction . 
RESULTS : drug1 has demonstrated effectiveness in men with erectile dysfunction associated with prostatectomy , radiation therapy , diabetes mellitus , certain neurologic disorders , and drug therapy ( eg , drug2 [ drug3 ] ) . 
It has not been as effective in women with sexual dysfunction , with the exception of drug1 - associated sexual dysfunction . 
Some disorders unrelated to sexual dysfunction ( eg , esophageal motility dysfunction ) may also respond to drug1 . 
In the general population , drug1 is considered to have an acceptable tolerability profile ; 
however , patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking drug1 therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with drug2 therapy . 
In addition , patients taking drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme , which metabolizes drug1 , may experience increased drug concentrations and possible toxicity from normal doses of drug2 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 is an effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in men . 
The decision to prescribe this agent should include such considerations as the cost-risk-benefit balance , patient access , drug distribution pathways , and prescription drug coverage . 
Tumor phenotype and susceptibility to progression as an expression of subpopulations of initiated murine cells . 
Currently , it is conceived that a number of events , or hits , are required for the induction of tumors by chemical agents . 
The first phase of this sequence , initiation , is considered to result from at least one event in the genetic apparatus . 
Analyses of this sequence , however , usually give little consideration to the nature of the target cell or to the characteristics of the resultant tumors . 
Vesselinovitch et al. . 
( Cancer Res. , 38 : 2003-2010 , 1978 ) have reported that a single , small pulse of carcinogen can induce early and numerous liver tumors when administered neonatally to mice with a genetic predisposition to hepatotumorigenesis . 
In the current study , the nonpredisposed strain C57BL/6N was also shown to be highly susceptible to diethylnitrosamine during the neonatal period . 
C57BL/6N demonstrated large numbers of two of the three types of liver tumors seen in livers of genetically predisposed mice , one of which required the additional stimulus of dietary drug1 for growth . 
Tumors of more malignant phenotype were demonstrated only in genetically predisposed mice ( C57BL/6N X C3H/HeN F1 ) that received one dose of carcinogen . 
These findings suggest that the phenotype of a tumor that results from a pulse of a chemical carcinogen may depend upon the target cell . 
The initiated cells that result from this hit may vary from those that demonstrate very little progression in cell type and may or may not require exogenous enhancement of growth to those that can progress very rapidly to fully malignant behavior . 
The latter might arise from a hit in a genetically initiated cell , the result of which is a more rapid progression in tumor type . 
Effects of drug1 upon the metabolism of chylomicron-like emulsions in patients with coronary artery disease . 
Slow chylomicron intravascular catabolism has been associated with coronary artery disease and screening for drugs that can speed-up this process can be important . 
In this study , the effects of drug1 upon chylomicron metabolism was tested by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 12 patients with coronary artery disease , aged 59 + / -11 years , ( total cholesterol : 240 + / -41 mg/dl ; triglycerides : 188 + / -42 mg/dl ) submitted to a randomized , crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled study with administration of 1 g per day drug2 or placebo for 1-month . 
A 1-month washout period was inserted between the treatment periods . 
Patients were intravenously injected a chylomicron-like emulsion doubly labeled with 14C-cholesteryl oleate and 3H-triolein at baseline and after treatments . 
After drug1 treatment , there was decrease of total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels and a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma levels . 
drug1 elicited 62 % enhancement of post - drug2 lipolytic activity and 100 % increase of 3H-triglyceride fractional clearance rate compared with placebo treatment . 
14C-cholesterol ester fractional clearance rate was 260 % greater after drug1 than after placebo . 
Therefore , a potent effect of drug1 on both chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal was achieved , indicating that this drug can be used to improve this metabolism in future prospective studies . 
Selective survival in drug1 and drug2 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O11 from drug addicts . 
The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , particularly serotype O11 , in drug1 and drug2 
was evaluated as a possible explanation for the association of deep-seated infection with this organism and abuse of these drugs . 
The mean reduction of growth caused by the drugs was 1,000-fold greater for 49 Pseudomonas strains from normal subjects than for 32 strains from drug addicts ( 4.2 vs. 1.3 logs of reduction at 2 hr , P less than .0005 ) . 
A common phenotypic subset of the serotype O11 strains from drug addicts was especially resistant to the inhibitory effects . 
Twelve strains of Staphylococcus aureus ( a frequent cause of infection in drug1 , but not in drug2 and drug3 , addicts ) were completely inhibited by the drug combination . 
Dose-response curves ( derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders ) showed that drug1 was responsible for the inhibitory activity , which was partially antagonized by drug2 . 
We conclude that an ability of some P. 
aeruginosa serotype O11 strains , but not S. 
aureus , to survive in drug1 and drug2 may explain in part a shift from S. 
aureus to P. 
aeruginosa as common pathogens of drug addicts in areas where abuse of this combination of drugs has increased . 
Influence of coadministration of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetics and QTc intervals in healthy volunteers . 
STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular safety of drug2 at steady state in healthy men . 
DESIGN : Open-label , three-phase , sequential study . 
SETTING : Clinical research center . 
SUBJECTS : Twelve healthy male volunteers . 
INTERVENTIONS : Each subject was treated according to the following sequence : baseline ; 
phase 1 ( days 1-6 ) : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ; 
washout ( days 7-13 ) ; 
phase 2 ( days 14-44 ) : drug1 20 mg/day ; 
and phase 3 ( days 45-52 ) : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ( days 45-51 ) plus drug2 20 mg/day ( days 45-52 ) . 
MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS : Blood samples were drawn and 12-lead electrocardiograms performed at specified time points after the last morning dose of drug1 in phases 1 and 3 . 
Blood samples also were taken before morning doses on the 3rd , 4th , and 5th days of phases 1 and 3 . 
Electrocardiograms were done at baseline and on the last day of the washout period and phase 2 . 
Coadministration of drug1 significantly decreased drug2 plasma concentrations . 
There were no clinically significant changes in corrected QT intervals during administration of drug1 alone or with drug2 . 
drug1 was well tolerated when administered alone or with drug2 . 
CONCLUSION : drug1 can be administered safely to patients receiving low therapeutic dosages of drug2 . 
Activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 against Cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture . 
The in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 was investigated . 
drug1 showed moderate activity , which increased with increasing concentration to 55.7 % suppression of growth at 20 microM . 
Moreover , its activity was enhanced when it was combined with either drug1 or drug2 with 90 % parasite reduction at the highest concentration tested . 
drug1 may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either drug2 or drug3 . 
Modification of surface histidine residues abolishes the cytotoxic activity of drug1 . 
drug1 displays both cytotoxic and enterotoxic activities . 
It has recently been demonstrated that drug1 exerts its cytotoxic effect by the glucosylation of the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family . 
drug1 , at pH 7.0 , was used to chemically modify exposed histidine residues on drug2 . 
Modification of drug1 with drug2 abolished both its cytotoxic activity and the ability of the toxin to bind Zn-Sepharose gel . 
Treatment of drug1 with [ ( 14 ) C ] - drug2 revealed concentration dependent labelling of histidine residues on the toxin molecules . 
The effects of drug1 could be reversed by drug2 treatment . 
These data suggest the modified histidine residues on drug1 are critical to its cytotoxic activity . 
Histidine modification had no effect on the glucosyl transferase enzyme activity of drug1 . 
However , modification abolished the ` cold ' binding of toxin to bovine thyroglobulin in an ELISA and reduced ligand binding activity in a rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination assay . 
The data suggest that the histidine residues may be crucial to the receptor-binding activity of drug1 . 
Exposed histidines on drug1 are available for drug2 chelation , and these have been exploited in the development of a novel purification protocol for drug3 using drug4 - chelating chromatography . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in vitro . 
The minimal inhibitory concentrations of drug1 and drug2 alone and in combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic , facultative , and anaerobic clinical isolates . 
All 77 strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Diplococcus pneumoniae , Streptococcus pyogenes , and anaerobic bacteria ( except for three strains of Clostridium ) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
drug1 did not interfere with the activity of drug2 within the range of concentrations tested ( 0.1 to 100 mug/ml ) ; 
for some strains combinations were synergistic . 
Sixty-two ( 94 % ) of 66 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains . 
All 20 strains of enterococcus , three strains of Clostridium , three strains of Escherichia coli , and one strain of Proteus rettgeri were resistant to both drug1 ( minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml ) and drug2 ( minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml ) . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains . 
Except for drug1 - sensitive isolates , synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo . 
Antagonism was never observed . 
drug1 and the common cold . 
Evaluation of its efficacy and toxicity . 
We reviewed the clinical data relating to the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic doses of drug1 in the prevention and treatment of the common cold . 
Although one study tentatively supports the hypothesis that such doses of drug1 may be efficacious , a second study by the same group did not confirm the significant findings , and no clear , reproducible pattern of efficacy has emerged from the review of all the evidence . 
Similarly , there is currently little adequate evidence on either the presence or the absence of serious adverse reactions to such doses of drug1 , although many such reactions have been hypothesized . 
The unrestricted use of drug1 for these purposes can not be advocated on the basis of the evidence currently available . 
Effects of drug1 in a light/dark test in mice and the contribution of adenosine receptors . 
We investigated the effects of adenosine receptor antagonists , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ( drug5 ) , in a light/dark test in mice . 
All antagonists decreased the time spent in the light zone in this test , which suggested that these compounds have anxiogenic effects . 
The anxiogenic effects of drug1 were reduced by pretreatment with drug2 , an A2-selective agonist , but not by drug3 ( drug4 ) , an A1-selective agonist . 
However , the antagonism of the drug1 - induced anxiogenic effects by drug2 was only observed in the time spent in the light zone , and drug3 - induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by drug4 nor by drug5 . 
Finally , it is notable that xanthine-derived adenosine antagonists tested here commonly showed anxiogenic effects in the light/dark test in mice . 
It is suggested that there is a minor contribution of adenosine receptors to these effects , although drug1 - induced anxiogenic effects were antagonized by an A2 receptor agonist . 
Restoration of drug1 susceptibility in Enterococcus faecalis by antiresistance determinant gene transfer . 
We assessed the ability of gene transfer to reverse drug1 resistance in class A ( VanA ) glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecalis . 
Recombinant shuttle vectors containing a vanH promoter-vanA antisense gene cassette fully restored drug1 susceptibility through a combined transcriptional activator binding domain decoy and inducible vanA antisense RNA effect . 
Induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to drug1 and drug2 . 
1 , drug1 ( drug2 ) , the active metabolite of drug3 , is a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . 
We have shown that MCF-7 cells treated with 100 nM drug1 exhibit characteristic apoptotic morphology ( pyknotic nuclei , chromatin and cytoplasmic condensation , nuclear matrix protein reorganization ) within 48 h . 
In the experiments reported here , we examined the interactions between drug1 and the drug2 drug3 ( drug4 ) , which also induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells . 
Our data suggest that drug1 significantly potentiates the reduction in cell number induced by drug2 alone . 
Combined treatment with drug1 and drug2 enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation . 
We have selected a subclone of MCF-7 cells resistant to drug1 ( MCF-7D3Res ) . 
These cells express the vitamin D receptor and exhibit doubling times comparable to the parental MCF-7 cells , even when grown in 100 mM drug1 . 
Treatment of both parental and resistant MCF-7 cells with drug1 induces apoptosis and clusterin . 
These data emphasize that apoptosis can be induced in MCF-7 cells either by activation of drug1 - mediated signalling or disruption of drug2 - dependent signalling . 
Cholinergic role in drug1 's effects on evoked potentials in visual cortex of the albino rat . 
Photic evoked potentials were recorded from the visual cortex of chronically implanted albino rats . 
Since photic evoked potential components are representations of neural pathways which are activated during photic stimulation , study of the effects of drug1 on these components may help to trace pathways which are affected by drug2 . 
In the present study , evoked potentials were recorded at 5 , 20 , and 40 min following IP injections of saline , drug1 ( 2.0 g/kg ) , drug2 ( 0.6 mg/kg ) or drug3 ( 15.0 mg/kg ) on separate days . 
drug1 depressed the amplitudes of most evoked potential components in comparison to saline administration . 
Component P2 , however , was increased in amplitude . 
drug1 briefly reduced the amplitude of most components , including P2 . 
In contrast , drug1 increased the amplitudes of components P1 and P2 , while decreasing components N1 , N2 and N3 for varying durations of time . 
drug1 pretreatment augmented the depressant effect of drug2 on the early components P1 and N1 , while attenuating drug3 's influence on components P2 and P3 . 
Pretreatment with drug1 likewise further reduced the amplitudes of components P1 and N1 , and produced a similar effect on component N3 . 
drug1 , either alone or in combination with drug2 , produced approximately the same degree of enhancement of component P2 . 
In comparison to saline values , all three agents produced reliable increases in peak latency for most of the components , with only N3 showing no effects . 
The amplitude data from this study suggest that drug1 's augmentation of component P2 may result , at least in part , from alterations in cholinergic functions . 
Increased hepatotoxicity of drug1 by concomitant administration of drug2 in the rat . 
Since drug1 is frequently co-administered with drug2 , it is of clinical interest to study the effect of drug3 on the hepatotoxicity of drug4 . 
In male Sprague-Dawley rats fasted for 18 h , concomitant administration of drug1 ( 0.1 g/kg , i.p. ) 
as judged by increased serum enzyme activities and increased incidence of hepatic necrosis . 
Careful observations on hepatotoxicity are suggested when drug1 is prescribed with drug2 . 
Dual effect of drug1 on the drug2 - induced contraction and norepinephrine release in the guinea-pig vas deferens . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) , C129H223N3O54 , isolated from marine coelenterates of Palythoa tuberculosa , caused a first rapid contraction followed by the slow phasic contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens . 
In the presence of drug1 ( 10 ( -5 ) M ) , drug2 ( 10 ( -8 ) M ) failed to cause the first contraction ; 
however , the second contraction was potentiated . 
In the presence of drug1 ( 10 ( -6 ) M ) , the second contraction was inhibited selectively . 
When drug1 was applied to the muscle in the presence of drug2 , both first and second contractile responses to drug3 were abolished . 
When the muscle was exposed to the potassium-depleted solution , the first contractile response to drug1 was rather potentiated . 
drug1 caused the release of norepinephrine from the muscle . 
Exposure of the muscle to drug1 ( 10 ( -5 ) M ) markedly increased the drug2 - induced release . 
It is indicated that the first and second contractile responses to drug1 have entirely different properties . 
The second response is due to a release of norepinephrine from nerves and was potentiated by drug1 through the increase in the norepinephrine release , whereas the first response was not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and was inhibited by drug2 . 
The mechanism of the action of drug1 was discussed in the relation with Na,K-ATPase . 
Analgesic effects of drug1 . 
The literature provides considerable evidence indicating that several , but not all drug1 , are indeed drug2 and some are drug3 as well . 
Those for which effectiveness is reported includes drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
The proposed mechanisms of analgesic action of drug1 are reviewed and discussed . 
The literature suggests that more than one mechanism of action exists for them . 
There is considerable evidence suggesting that histaminergic and serotoninergic central pathways are involved in nociception and that drug1 drugs can modulate their responses ( 1 ) . 
The evidence for a role for norepinephrine and dopamine and the effects of drug1 on them are less well established . 
Still other pathways have been proposed . 
A greater understanding of pain mechanisms will aid in elucidating the role of drug1 in analgesia . 
Effect of drug1 on voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes in bovine chromaffin cells . 
In previous reports we have shown that drug1 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) channels in neuronal cells . 
However , these studies did not show whether drug1 - induced inhibition of Ca ( 2 + ) currents discriminates among the various Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes , although it is known that there are at least five different Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes in neuronal cells . 
In this study we investigated the effect of drug1 on high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes using their drug2 drug3 ( L-type ) , drug4 ( N-type ) , or drug5 ( P-type ) in bovine chromaffin cells . 
We could observe that drug1 inhibited high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) currents in a dose-dependent manner . 
The IC ( 50 ) was about 120 microgram/ml . 
drug1 had no effect on drug2 response . 
These data suggest that drug1 are negatively coupled to three types of calcium channels in bovine chromaffin cell , including an drug2 - sensitive ( N-type ) channel , an drug3 - sensitive ( P-type ) channel and drug4 / drug5 / drug6 - resistant ( presumptive Q-type ) channel . 
Thus , the selective regulation of voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) subtypes by drug1 in bovine chromaffin cell could be the cellular basis of antistress effects induced by drug2 . 
A proposed mechanism for the potentiation of cAMP-mediated acid secretion by drug1 . 
Acid secretion in isolated rabbit gastric glands was monitored by the accumulation of [ ( 14 ) C ] drug1 . 
Stimulation of the glands with drug1 synergistically augmented the response to dibutyryl cAMP . 
The augmentation persisted even after drug1 was washed out and was resistant to chelated extracellular Ca ( 2 + ) and to inhibitors of either protein kinase C or calmodulin kinase II . 
drug1 at 10 microM preferentially blocked the secretory effect of drug2 and its synergism with cAMP , whereas it had no effect on histamine - or cAMP-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min . 
drug1 inhibited the drug2 - stimulated intracellular Ca ( 2 + ) concentration ( [ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) ) increase due to release from the Ca ( 2 + ) store . 
Treatment of the glands with drug1 redistributed type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor ( the major subtype in the parietal cell ) from the fraction containing membranes of large size to the microsomal fraction , suggesting a dissociation of the store from the plasma membrane . 
These findings suggest that intracellular Ca ( 2 + ) release by cholinergic stimulation is critical for determining synergism with cAMP in parietal cell activation and that functional coupling between the Ca ( 2 + ) store and the receptor is maintained by actin microfilaments . 
Phenytoin intoxication induced by drug1 . 
A patient had phenytoin intoxication after administration of drug1 , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . 
The serum concentration of drug1 increased dramatically from 16.6 to 49.1 microg/mL when drug2 was coadministered , although the daily dosage of drug3 and other drug4 had not changed . 
During drug1 and fluvoxamine treatment , ataxia , a typical side effect of drug2 , was observed . 
The genotypes of drug1 and 2C19 , the enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism , were homozygous for the wild-type alleles ( drug2 * 1 / * 1 and 2C19 * 1 / * 1 ) . 
The interaction may be a result of inhibition of both drug1 and 2C19 by drug2 . 
Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the drug1 - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 is known to raise serum drug2 levels . 
This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic basis of this interaction in 10 normal subjects . 
The pharmacokinetic variables for drug1 were determined after a 1.0 mg intravenous dose of drug2 in each subject , before and after oral drug3 , 400 mg daily for 3 weeks . 
During drug1 administration , systemic clearance of drug2 was reduced from 234 + / - 72 ml/min ( mean + / - standard deviation ) to 172 + / - 33 ml/min ( p less than 0.01 ) . 
This was due to reductions in both renal clearance ( from 105 + / - 39 to 84 + / - 15 ml/min ) ( p less than 0.05 ) and nonrenal clearance ( from 130 + / - 38 to 88 + / - 20 ml/min ) ( p less than 0.01 ) . 
drug1 half-life of elimination was prolonged from 34 + / - 13 to 40 + / - 16 hours ( p less than 0.05 ) . 
drug1 volume of distribution was not significantly changed . 
drug1 caused a three - to fivefold increase in serum reverse triiodothyronine levels , but changes in thyroid function were not quantitatively related to the changes in drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
These alterations in drug1 pharmacokinetics produced by drug2 explain the increase in serum drug3 level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically . 
Activation of an effector immediate-early gene arc by drug1 . 
As immediate-early genes ( IEGs ) are thought to play a critical role in mediating stimulus-induced neural plasticity , IEG response induced by drug1 ( drug2 ) has been characterized to define the changes in gene expression that may underlie its long-lasting behavioral effects . 
Although activation of several transcription factor IEGs has been described , little is known about effector IEGs . 
Here , we have examined whether drug1 administration affects expression of an effector IEG arc ( activity-regulated , cytoskeleton-associated ) that encodes a protein with homology to spectrin . 
Using in situ hybridization , we observed that drug1 caused a rapid and transient dose-dependent increase in arc mRNA level in the striatum and cortex that was abolished by pretreatment with the specific dopamine D1 receptor antagonist drug2 but not by an drug3 drug4 . 
drug1 induced arc mRNA in layers IV and VI of the cortex which dopamine receptor are localized to . 
These results suggest that D1 receptors are coupled to activation of arc gene , which may be involved in functional or structural alterations underlying neural plasticity triggered by drug1 . 
Differential actions of intrathecal drug1 on blocking the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 in rats . 
In the present study , it is proposed that the drug1 applied to supraspinal brain sites produced their analgesic effects by the activation of different descending pain inhibitory systems . 
The blockade of the spinal endorphinergic system by intrathecal drug1 on the production of tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 was then studied . 
Intraventricular injection of drug1 and drug2 produced an inhibition of the tail-flick response to the heat stimulus in rats . 
Intrathecal injection of drug1 at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of drug2 , and a high dose of drug3 ( 40 micrograms ) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug4 ( 16 micrograms ) . 
On the other hand , intrathecal drug1 ( 12-120 micrograms ) had only a very weak effect on the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 ( 40 micrograms ) . 
Intraventricular injection of drug1 at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 . 
The results indicate that a spinal drug1 - sensitive endorphinergic system is involved in the production of drug2 but not drug3 - induced tail-flick inhibition , and suggest that intraventricular drug4 and drug5 elicit their pharmacological actions via the activation of different descending pain inhibitory systems ; 
descending epsilon and mu systems for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , are proposed . 
Pharmacological treatment of depression : the role of drug1 . 
Depression is reaching epidemic proportions in the western world . 
With each successive generation more people are becoming more severely depressed at a younger age . 
Drug interactions : How to identify them . 
Interactions between theraputic agents have been recognized as increasingly important causes of drug at their usual recommended dose may , under certain conditions , produce toxicity of life-endangering proportions . 
While the recognition of drug toxicity resulting from interactions is of importance to all physciains , it is especially so for the clinician responsible for the welfare of those in the aerospace environment . 
This paper attempts to provide a basis for the understanding and identifications of important drug interactions . 
Guidelines are provided to assist the clinician in his logical approach to the identification of drug interactions when serious drug toxicity is encountered in a pateint . 
Only with knowledge of the interaction can the therapeutic regimen be altered so as to provide therapeutic levels of necessary drugs while avoiding toxicity . 
Changes in urinary homocysteine following drug1 and drug2 administration to rats . 
The present work involved the administration of both drug1 and drug2 to groups of rats , followed by determination of the homocysteine excretion rate in urine . 
The results indicate that a statistically significant difference exists between the excreted levels of homocysteine in the urine of both control and drug1 - treated rats and the levels shown by rats treated with drug2 . 
The implications of these results are discussed , especially with respect to observations which indicate that homocysteine may be a precipitating factor in the development of thrombosis . 
Also included in this paper is a study which confirms the identity of the HPLC peak as being homocysteine by forming a radioactive derivative of this particular sulphydryl-containing amino acid , and then analysing the resulting mixture by TLC . 
Effect of drug1 and drug2 on the antinociceptive effect of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 in mice . 
The influence of drug1 and drug2 on antinociceptive effect of drug3 ( 10 mg/kg ) , drug4 ( 500 mg/kg ) and drug5 ( 10 mg/kg ) was investigated in a mouse model using the tail-flick and hot-plate tests . 
All drugs were injected intraperitoneally . 
drug1 were administered to mice 30 min before applying the drug2 . 
Measurement of nociception was performed within 2 h after drug1 administration . 
drug1 at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg injected with drug2 was found to decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug3 . 
Similarly , drug1 decreased the antinociceptive effect of drug2 ( only in the tail-flick test ) and drug3 . 
drug1 used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of drug2 , drug3 ( only in the tail-flick test ) and drug4 . 
[ The effect of drug1 on the renal excretion of drug2 and drug3 in dogs ] The intravenous injection of drug4 in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced drug5 and drug6 excretion in chronic canine experiments . 
The higher drug1 and drug2 excretion was due to their increased renal tubular secretion . 
In dogs , drug1 unchanged the secretion of drug2 , a test agent for anionic transport . 
Possible extrarenal mechanisms of action of drug1 on drug2 and drug3 transport were also examined . 
Differential regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells by drug1 , a homodimeric disintegrin , and monomeric disintegrins drug2 and drug3 . 
The homodimeric disintegrin drug1 was compared directly to the monomeric disintegrins drug2 and drug3 for the ability to affect protein tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells . 
It was observed that drug1 had a dramatic effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of several proteins in T24 human bladder cancer cells , including robust induction of phosphorylation of proteins in the range of 120-140 kDa . 
drug1 alone had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in T24 cells , but dose-dependently inhibits the effects of drug2 when both are added simultaneously . 
Among the proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to drug1 treatment is CAS , a 130 kDa adapter protein involved in integrin signaling . 
drug1 alone was found to have no effect on CAS , but can completely block drug2 - induced phosphorylation of this protein in MDA-MB-435 cells . 
These observations strongly suggest that the homodimeric structure of drug1 functionally distinguishes it from other monomeric members of the disintegrin family . 
Toxicity of cadmium and drug1 to miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni . 
The specific objectives of this study were to elucidate metal toxicity to hatching , survival and avoidance behaviour of Schistosoma mansoni miracidia . 
The toxicity of cadmium , drug1 , and cadmium/zinc mixtures at concentrations ranging from 10000 to 10 microg/l was investigated . 
Metal mixture toxicity investigation was undertaken with equal concentrations of the metals . 
The hatching of miracidia from eggs was inhibited by concentrations of 1000-10000 microg/l of single metals . 
Metal mixtures had no effect on drug1 hatching . 
Survival of miracidia was reduced by increasing metal concentration except at concentrations of 10 microg/l for single metal toxicity where survival was increased above the control . 
Miracidia demonstrated a rapid avoidance behaviour when briefly exposed to heavy metals . 
The mechanisms of metal toxicity to miracidia are briefly discussed . 
Drug-lab interactions : implications for nutrition support . 
drug1 interference with urine ketone test . 
It is important that health care professionals be aware of the potential for medications to interfere with clinical laboratory tests . 
Medications can cause in vivo effects when the concentration or activity of the analyte is altered before the analysis and therefore the assay result is true and accurate . 
An in vitro effect occurs when the medication interferes with the assay , and the result is erroneous and can not be interpreted . 
This report describes a recently identified case of interference of drug1 with the urine test for ketones and demonstrates the importance of a thorough medication review in evaluating abnormal laboratory tests . 
[ Pharmacologic interactions in chronic treatments : corrective measures for its prevention in a basic area of rural health ] OBJECTIVES : To identify the pharmacological interactions of clinical relevance ( PICR ) in the medication authorization cards ( MAC ) of the chronically ill and to establish strategies to minimise their appearance . 
DESIGN : Cross-sectional descriptive study . 
SETTING : Rural primary care centre . 
PATIENTS : Random sample of 626 MAC out of a total of 1306 . 
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : In December 1998 , the following was gathered for every MAC with more than one drug treatment : age , sex , number of drugs , intrinsic value , drugs prescribed , daily dose and pharmacological interactions ( PI ) , classified ( using the scale of Hansten 1996 ) into light and clinically relevant . 
Statistical analysis : Mantel-Haenszel ( alpha = 0.05 ) . 
Patients ' mean age was 69.1 ( 95 % CI , + / - 1.2 ) . 
Mean number of drugs per MAC was 4 ( 95 % CI , + / - 0.2 ) . 
341 PI affecting 197 patients ( 31.5 % , 95 % CI , + / - 3.6 ) were identified . 
24.9 % ( 95 % CI , + / - 4.5 ) were PICR , detected in 11.7 % ( 95 % CI , + / - 2.5 ) of the MAC . 
The existence of PI was related to the number of drugs prescribed to each patient ( p < 0.01 ) . 
There were 26 PI with drugs of low intrinsic value ( 7.6 % ; 95 % CI , + / - 2.8 ) . 
74.1 % ( 95 % CI , + / - 9.3 ) of the total PICR could be avoided by simple recommendations ; 
and the remaining 25.9 % ( 95 % CI , + / - 9.3 ) by monitoring and follow-up of patients . 
CONCLUSIONS : It is important to identify the medications most commonly involved in the PICR so as to establish corrective measures to minimise the risks arising from multiple medication . 
Four educational messages advise on over 60 % of the PICR detected . 
Neurochemical and functional consequences following drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 . 
The neurochemical and functional consequences following drug1 administration to the rat were evaluated and compared to similar effects following drug2 administration . 
It was observed that drug1 induced long lasting depletions of striatal dopamine concentrations and this neurotoxic effect could be prevented by drug2 pretreatment . 
The drug1 - induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of drug2 and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of drug3 in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm . 
drug1 , like drug2 , produced depletions of striatal dopamine but these actions were potentiated by drug3 pretreatment . 
These observations are discussed in reference to possible deleterious effects following the administration of drug1 to patients with Parkinson 's Disease . 
Responses to drug1 of the perfused pancreas of the genetically diabetic Chinese hamster . 
Nonketotic , genetically diabetic Cinese hamsters show subnormal pancreatic insulin release and impaired suppression of glucagon in response to glucose . 
To study the pancreatic effects of other agents , dynamic insulin and glucagon release was measured from the in vitro perfused pancreases of normal and diabetic Chinese hamsters in response to various combinations of drug1 ( 20mM ) , drug2 ( 100 or 150 mg . per 100 ml . ) , and drug3 ( 10 mM ) . 
drug1 alone caused identical insulin and glucagon release in diabetics and normals . 
drug1 , alone and in the presence of drug2 , caused subnormal insulin release and less suppression of glucagon release in the diabectics than in the normals . 
drug1 , in the presence of drug2 and drug3 , caused excessive glucagon release but nearly normal insulin release in the diabetics . 
drug1 , in the absence of drug2 or drug3 , caused excessive glucagon release in the diabetics and undetectable insulin release in either diabetics or normals . 
Pancreatic content after perfusion did not correlate with release during perfusion . 
Infusion of drug1 alone markedly decreased the amount of extractable pancreatic insulin and glucagon . 
These results indicate that the pancreatic alpha cell of the diabetic Chinese hamster responds excessively to drug1 , as is seen in the human diabetic . 
This defect is not related to acute insulin release or the presence of drug1 . 
Further , these results confirm that the diabetic Chinese hamster 's alpha and beta cells respond normally to drug1 , but are relatively insensitive to drug2 . 
Interference of biocytin with drug1 - evoked hyperpolarization and membrane properties of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons . 
In our laboratory , preliminary whole-cell , tight seal recordings of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons including biocytin in the patch pipette yielded a significantly smaller proportion of neurons hyperpolarized by drug1 compared with recordings without biocytin . 
Therefore , we investigated the effects of biocytin inclusion on drug1 responses and other membrane properties during whole-cell , tight seal recordings of these neurons . 
The percentage of neurons hyperpolarized by drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 was significantly reduced when 1 % but not < 
or = 0.2 % biocytin was included in the recording pipette , compared with neurons recorded without biocytin . 
However , a significantly higher proportion of neurons fired spontaneous action potentials with either 0.05-0 .2 or 1 % biocytin compared to no biocytin . 
Resting membrane potential , input impedance and the proportion of neurons displaying transient outward rectification were each significantly altered for neurons recorded with 1 % but not 0.05-0 .2 % biocytin . 
These effects may be due to a relatively specific blockade of diverse potassium channel types . 
Because efficient labeling can be achieved with 0.1 % biocytin with whole-cell recording , higher concentrations are contraindicated . 
drug1 : in vitro evaluation of its permeation enhancing effect on peptide drugs . 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 ( drug4 ) conjugates on the intestinal permeation of drug5 ( drug6 ) and model peptide drugs , drug7 and drug8 . 
drug1 was covalently linked to carbodiimide activated drug2 . 
Iodometric titration of the polymer conjugates was used to determine the extent of immobilised drug1 . 
Permeation studies were performed on guinea pig small intestinal mucosa mounted in Ussing-type chamber . 
Unmodified drug1 ( 1 % m/v ) significantly improved the transport ratio ( R = P ( app ) polymer / P ( app ) control ) of drug2 to 1.3 and 1 % ( m/v ) drug3 conjugated with drug4 further enhanced the permeation . 
drug1 conjugation at 3.6 , 5.3 and 7.3 % ( m/m ) resulted in R-values of 1.4 , 1.7 and 1.8 , respectively . 
Decreasing the concentration of drug1 , exhibiting 7.3 % ( m/m ) of immobilised drug2 ( CMC-Cys7 .3 ) from 1 % ( m/v ) to 0.5 % ( m/v ) decreased the R-value of drug3 from 1.8 to 1.2 . 
drug1 at 1 % ( m/v ) in the presence of free drug2 had no significant effect on the R-value of drug3 compared to drug4 alone . 
Formulation of fluorescence labelled drug1 and drug2 in unconjugated drug3 ( 1 % m/v ) did not significantly improve the permeation , however in the presence of 1 % ( m/v ) drug4 7.3 a significantly improved permeation was observed ( R = 1.3 ) . 
Conjugation at drug1 with drug2 moieties significantly improves the intestinal permeation of the hydrophilic molecule drug3 and the model peptide drugs drug4 and drug5 in vitro , therefore this conjugated system maybe useful for peroral administration of peptide drugs in the future . 
Effects of low temperatures on microtubules in the non-myelinated axons of post-ganglionic sympathetic nerves . 
The effect of temperature changes on the number of microtubules in non-myelinated axons has been studied in cat inferior mesenteric ganglion/hypogastric nerve preparations incubated at various temperatures in Eagles minimal essential tissue culture medium in vitro . 
At 37 degrees C the non-myelinated axons contained 28.4 plus or minus 0.8 S.E.M. 
( 54 ) microtubules per axon . 
After incubation at 0 degrees C for 4 h this number fell to 2.3 plus or minus 0.1 S.E.M. 
( 41 ) but returned to normal levels when the nerves were rewarmed . 
This loss of microtubules on cooling the nerves and their reappearance on rewarming was a rapid process ; 
it was independent of the influence of the nueronal cell body and of protein synthesis within the axon . 
The preservation of the microtubules was improved when D2O was present in the incubation medium . 
Reformed microtubules appeared to function normally with respect to their possible role in the transport of noradrenaline storage vesicles along the axons . 
The drug1 for urinary tract infections : a review . 
The drug1 are a rapidly growing class of drug2 with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive aerobic bacteria . 
These agents , including drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , have been extensively studied and have demonstrated efficacy and safety profiles comparable to those of other traditional agents for the treatment of complicated or uncomplicated urinary tract infections and prostatitis . 
Advantages offered by this class of drug1 include optimal pharmacokinetics , effectiveness against multidrug-resistant organisms , and oral administration even when parenteral drug2 are generally used . 
The drug1 are also extensively used in urologic surgery . 
If taken 1 hour before drug1 ( drug2 ) , drug3 does not affect drug4 exposure , despite persistent buffering effects . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 significantly reduces the level of exposure to drug3 , but it is unclear how soon after drug4 administration drug5 may be given safely . 
We compared drug1 pharmacokinetics and gastric pH in 12 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients by use of 800 mg of drug2 alone versus 800 mg of drug3 administered 1 h after drug4 administration . 
Median gastric pH was significantly higher when drug1 was taken after drug2 administration ; 
however , no significant difference in the maximum concentration in plasma or the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 h was observed . 
drug1 may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of drug2 .

Hypothermia as an index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction in the rat . 
Decreased core temperature in female rats was investigated as one possible index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction ( DER ) . 
Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when drug1 was administered to rats treated with drug2 8 hours before the drug3 challenge . 
The decrease in temperature began within 20 minutes after drug1 administration , reaching a maximal decrease between 60 and 120 minutes post drug2 . 
The core temperature returned to normal 300 minutes after drug1 . 
The blood pressure ( carotid cannulation ) decreased along with the core temperature . 
Maximal hypotension was found 120 minutes post drug1 , and returned to normal 300 minutes after drug2 . 
Heart rate increased initially and returned to normal 40 minutes after drug1 challenge . 
Intestinal absorption of drug1 in the chick . 
The intestinal absorption of drug1 ( drug2 ) has been investigated in the chick by means of the in situ ligated duodenal loop technique . 
By this procedure , it was observed that drug1 is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed ( 80-95 % ) from the lumen at drug2 concentrations up to 5 mM , declining to about 50 % absorption at 50 mM . 
Transfer from the intestinal lumen to the mucosal cells at low drug1 concentration ( 0.1 mM ) is rapid , while transfer from the mucosal cells to the body occurs more slowly . 
At stable drug1 concentrations greater than 1 mM , fractional mucosal cell accumulation of drug2 remains constant , while fractional transfer to the body declines . 
However , total mucosal accumulation of drug1 and that transferred to the body increase in a linear logarithmic fashion from 0.05 to 5 mm drug2 . 
The results indicate that drug1 readily penetrates both the mucosal and serosal surfaces of the epithelial membrane . 
Furthermore , drug1 and drug2 do not appear to share a common transport pathway in the duodenum and no evidence was obtained for any interaction between the two at this level . 
drug1 administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal drug2 absorption , acting primarily to enhance serosal transport . 
drug1 : an updated review of its use in the management of schizophrenia . 
drug1 , a drug2 , is a drug3 which has proven efficacy against the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . 
Compared with drug1 , it has greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A than for dopamine D2 receptors . 
In large , well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses , drug1 5 to 20 mg/day was significantly superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day in overall improvements in psychopathology rating scales and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptoms , and was comparable in effects on positive psychotic symptoms . 
The 1-year risk of relapse ( rehospitalisation ) was significantly lower with drug1 than with drug2 treatment . 
In the first double-blind comparative study ( 28-week ) of drug1 and drug2 , drug3 10 to 20 mg/day proved to be significantly more effective than drug4 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms but not on overall psychopathology symptoms . 
In contrast , preliminary results from an 8-week controlled study suggested drug1 2 to 6 mg/day was superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms ( p < 0.05 ) , although consistent with the first study , both agents demonstrated similar efficacy on measures of overall psychopathology . 
Improvements in general cognitive function seen with drug1 treatment in a 1-year controlled study of patients with early-phase schizophrenia , were significantly greater than changes seen with either drug2 or drug3 . 
However , preliminary results from an 8-week trial showed comparable cognitive enhancing effects of drug1 and drug2 treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder . 
Several studies indicate that drug1 has benefits against symptoms of aggression and agitation , while other studies strongly support the effectiveness of drug2 in the treatment of depressive symptomatology . 
drug1 is associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than drug2 and drug3 . 
In addition , drug1 is not associated with a risk of agranulocytosis as seen with drug2 or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as seen with drug3 or prolongation of the QT interval . 
The most common adverse effects reported with drug1 are bodyweight gain , somnolence , dizziness , anticholinergic effects ( constipation and dry mouth ) and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations . 
In comparison with drug1 , the adverse events reported significantly more frequently with drug2 in > or = 3.5 % of patients were dry mouth , bodyweight gain and increased appetite and compared with drug3 , only bodyweight gain occurred significantly more frequently with drug4 . 
The high acquisition cost of drug1 is offset by reductions in other treatment costs ( inpatient and/or outpatient services ) of schizophrenia . 
Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that drug1 does not significantly increase , and may even decrease , the overall direct treatment costs of schizophrenia , compared with drug2 . 
Compared with drug1 , drug2 has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs , despite the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug . 
drug1 treatment improves quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses to a greater extent than drug2 , and to broadly the same extent as drug3 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 demonstrated superior antipsychotic efficacy compared with drug2 in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia , and in the treatment of some patients with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia . 
The reduced risk of adverse events and therapeutic superiority compared with drug1 and drug2 in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms support the choice of drug3 as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response . 
Antimicrobial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with some drug2 . 
Antimicrobial activity of drug1 ( the aqueous extract from the carpophores of Ganoderma lucidum ( FR ) KARST ) was tested in vitro against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria by serial broth dilution method , and the antimicrobial activity was expressed by minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) . 
Among fifteen species of bacteria tested , the antimicrobial activity of drug1 was the most potent against Micrococcus luteus ( MIC , 0.75 mg/ml ) . 
To investigate the effects of antimicrobial combinations of drug1 with four kinds of drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 ) , the fractional inhibitory concentration index ( FICI ) was determined by checkerboard assay for each strain . 
The antimicrobial combinations of drug1 with four drug2 resulted in additive effect in most instances , synergism in two instances , and antagonism in two instances . 
Synergism was observed when drug1 was combined with drug2 against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella oxytoca . 
drug1 protects mouse tumour and normal tissues from the toxicity of oral drug2 . 
Because the drug1 drug2 is given exclusively by the oral route in man , we have carried out studies in mice on the antitumour activity , acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral drug3 , either alone or in combination with the chemosensitizer drug4 . 
In both plasma and KHT tumour the peak concentration and `` early '' 
AUC for total drug1 were about 1.4-1 .5 fold greater for the oral compared to the i.p. 
route . 
These differences were reflected in the roughly twofold greater antitumour activity for the oral route . 
In contrast , acute toxicity tests showed that oral drug1 was 1.45 times less toxic to normal tissue , although the dose-limiting organ may be different for the two routes . 
drug1 reduced the antitumour activity of oral drug2 by dose modifying factors ( DMF ) of 0.58-0 .71 . 
Similarly , the acute toxicity was also diminished by a DMF of 0.74 . 
drug1 has a complex effect on oral drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
The plasma and tumour total drug1 peak concentrations were reduced by 1.5 and 1.7 fold respectively . 
drug1 also reduced the `` early '' 
drug1 AUC , with the extent of the reduction depending on the minimum effective concentration ( MEC ) chosen . 
For example , the plasma drug1 AUC was reduced by factors of 1.05 and 9.6 for MEC values of 1 and 2 micrograms ml-1 respectively . 
We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral drug1 cytotoxicity by drug2 . 
Clinical trials of such combinations should be accompanied by detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation . 
Pharmacokinetic interaction between single oral doses of drug1 and drug2 in healthy volunteers . 
AIM AND BACKGROUND : The pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 , a drug2 metabolized by CYP3A4 , and the drug3 drug4 was studied in 18 healthy subjects . 
Several clinically important interactions have previously been reported for other drug1 that are metabolized by the same enzyme and for drug2 . 
METHODS : Healthy subjects who were 20 to 43 years old participated in an open , three-period , randomized , crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg oral dose of drug1 , a single oral 120-mg dose of drug2 , and the two drugs given together . 
The three study periods were separated by a 21-day washout phase . 
RESULTS : The geometric mean ( 90 % confidence interval ) whole blood drug1 area under the plasma concentration time-curve increased 60 % ( 35 % -90 % ) , from 736 to 1178 ng x h/mL , and maximum concentration increased 43 % ( 14 % -81 % ) , from 67 to 96 ng/mL , with drug2 coadministration , whereas the mean elimination half-life of drug3 decreased slightly , from 79 to 67 hours . 
Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of drug1 decreased with 38 % and 45 % , respectively , when drug2 was given with drug3 . 
The plasma maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 were unchanged after coadministration of drug4 , and no potentiation of the effects of drug5 on diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameters was seen . 
CONCLUSIONS : Single-dose drug1 coadministration leads to higher drug2 exposure , presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of drug3 . 
Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the drug1 - drug2 interaction , whole blood drug3 concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs . 
drug1 , a trans-3 ,4 - dimethyl-4 - ( 3-hydroxyphenyl ) piperidine , prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous drug2 without affecting analgesia . 
drug1 is a novel drug2 that may selectively prevent drug3 - induced gastrointestinal effects without reversing analgesia . 
Gastrointestinal transit time ( lactulose hydrogen breath test ) was measured in 14 volunteers with oral and intravenous placebo , oral placebo and intravenous drug1 ( 0.05 mg x kg ( -1 ) ) , and oral drug2 ( 4 mg ) and intravenous drug3 ( 0.05 mg x kg ( -1 ) ) in a double blind , cross-over study . 
drug1 prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes ( P = .005 ) ; 
drug1 prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes ( P = .005 ) ; this was prevented by drug2 ( P = .004 ) . 
Postoperatively , 45 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive drug1 ( 4 mg ) or placebo and intravenous drug2 ( 0.15 mg/kg ) or to receive oral and intravenous placebo . 
Analgesia and pupil constriction were measured . 
drug1 analgesia and pupil constriction were unaffected by drug2 and differed from placebo ( P < .002 ) . 
We conclude that drug1 prevents drug2 - induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia . 
The effects of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 on bar-press behavior in normal and genetically nervous dogs . 
Studies on two strains of pointer dogs have demonstrated that administration of a drug1 ( drug2 ) facilitates acquisition of goal-directed behavior in `` genetically nervous '' 
subjects . 
Continued admistration of the drug is required to maintain barpress response in this strain of dogs . 
The concomitant administration of either drug1 or drug2 , compounds which inhibit neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine , disrupts the behavioral response of the genetically nervous E-strain subjects to a far greater extent than the stable A-strain subjects . 
It is also shown that after 14 days of daily administration of drug1 , withdrawal of the drug not only re-results in almost complete loss of bar-press response in the E-strain subjects but also results in a temporary decrease in the acquired behavioral response of the stable A-strain subjects . 
Therapeutic drug monitoring can avoid iatrogenic alterations caused by drug1 ( MDP ) - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 is an drug2 used to treat a wide variety of infections caused by gram-negative organisms , but it is potentially toxic to the kidneys . 
Due to its nephrotoxicity , drug1 may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on drug2 bone scintigraphy . 
The presence of the drug1 in the kidneys , along with an increase in renal retention , tend to produce scintigraphic results that falsely identify characteristics related to diseases such as renal vascular , or urinary tract obstruction , and even renal cancer . 
An altered biodistribution may provide misleading information that can either mask or mimic certain disease symptoms . 
A method to maximize the therapeutic benefit of drug1 while minimizing the risk of nephrotoxicity and the appearance of a hot kidney on scintigraphy is desirable . 
Serial pharmacokinetic dosing has been proposed as a method to accomplish this goal . 
Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) of drug1 therapy , and bone scintigraphy employing drug2 as the drug3 was carried out in 22 patients . 
The data presented here demonstrate that with serial pharmacokinetic dosing of drug1 , the iatrogenic alteration caused by drug2 therapy can be avoided . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in anaesthetised horses . 
Evoked hind limb digital extensor tension ( hoof twitch ) was maintained at 40 % of baseline for 1 h by drug1 infusion in 7 horses anaesthetised with drug2 . 
After 1 h , drug1 was discontinued and hoof twitch allowed to recover to 75 % . 
drug1 was again given by infusion to maintain 40 % twitch for a second hour , then 2 mg drug2 / kg bwt were given i.v. 
drug1 infusion was continued for a third hour , and then hoof twitch was again allowed to recover spontaneously to 75 % . 
drug1 reduced twitch strength from 40 + / - 1 % ( mean + / - sem ) to 29 + / - 4 % within 7.0 + / - 1.5 min ( P = 0.02 ) . 
Twitch gradually returned to pre - drug1 strength over the course of the next hour . 
Recovery of hoof twitch from 50 % to 75 % took 7.7 + / - 0.7 min for drug1 alone and 11.5 + / - 2.7 min for drug2 plus drug3 ( P = 0.03 ) . 
Recovery from 50 % twitch to 75 % fade recovery took 13.8 + / - 0.8 min for drug1 alone and 13.7 + / - 1.2 min for drug2 plus drug3 . 
At 75 % recovery of fade , hoof twitch was 87 + / - 3 % for drug1 alone and 82 + / - 4 % for drug2 plus drug3 . 
Reversal of the block with drug1 and subsequent recovery of the horses from anaesthesia were uneventful . 
It was concluded that , although drug1 did augment the neuromuscular blockade of drug2 , the effect was minimal . 
Diagnostic , treatment and aftercare approaches to drug1 abuse . 
The general public feels that drug1 is not particularly dangerous because it does not produce a well defined physical dependency and abstinence syndrome . 
However , when addiction is defined as compulsion , loss of control and continued use in spite of adverse consequences , drug1 drug hunger can be seen as an agent of addictive disease . 
Withdrawal from drug1 dependence usually involves depression , anxiety and lethargy . 
These usually clear within a week , leaving only the `` drug hunger '' 
to contend with . 
Medication is rarely needed . 
When drug1 is the primary addiction , after withdrawal the most effective treatment is group therapy with other recovering cocaine abusers . 
We incorporate the principles of recovery and define positive and constructive alternatives in dealing with cocaine hunger . 
Recovery programs should be flexible and involve individual and family education on recovery and the nature of addictive disease . 
Exercise that produces cardiopulmonary stimulation is a helpful means of reducing drug hunger and anxiety during recovery therapy . 
Systemic drug1 . 
Understanding the breadth of systemic drug1 available for use by the dermatologist and their associated side-effect profiles and drug interactions allows the clinician to offer patients optimal care in the management of cutaneous infectious disease . 
Altered responsiveness to drug1 after exposure to organic lead . 
drug1 is known to effect the functional integrity of the limbic system , particularly the hippocampus , and to alter behaviors which are thought to be mediated through limbic function . 
Organometals also compromise the limbic system and result in deficits in learning and memory . 
Since both drug1 and organoleads are present in the environment and seem to influence limbic integration , the interaction of these two compounds was assessed in the present experiment . 
Thirty male rats of the Fischer-344 strain were divided into three equal groups and were given injections of drug1 ( drug2 ) ( 8.0 or 17.0 mg/kg/ml SC ) or the saline vehicle . 
Fourteen days later , all animals were challenged with a single hypnotic dose of drug1 ( 3.5 g/kg IP ) . 
The 20 % v/v solution of drug1 was prepared in water from a stock solution of 95 % drug2 . 
The latency to loss of the righting reflex and duration of sleep time were recorded while the rats were kept in sound-attenuating chambers . 
The rats treated with the highest dose of drug1 manifested significantly longer latencies to lose the righting reflex and shorter durations of sleep than did controls . 
These results suggest that exposure to environmental drug1 may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to drug2 . 
Evidence for reduction of drug1 uptake sites in the failing human heart . 
OBJECTIVES . 
This study investigated the role of neuronal uptake of drug1 ( uptake-1 ) in human heart failure as a local factor for altering concentrations of norepinephrine at the cardiac myocyte membranes . 
BACKGROUND . 
Several beta-adrenergic neuroeffector defects occur in heart failure . 
Whether an alteration in drug1 uptake-1 occurs is still unresolved . 
METHODS . 
The role of drug1 uptake-1 was studied in electrically stimulated ( 1 Hz , 37 degrees C ) human ventricular cardiac preparations and isolated myocardial membranes . 
RESULTS . 
The effectiveness of drug1 in increasing the force of contraction was decreased in relation to the degree of heart failure . 
In contrast , the potency of drug1 was increased in failing hearts ( New York Heart Association functional class IV ) in relation to the concentrations producing 50 % of the maximal effect ( EC50 ) . 
The EC50 values for drug1 , which is not a substrate for drug2 uptake-1 , were reduced in myocardium in functional classes II to III and IV compared with those in nonfailing myocardium . 
The uptake inhibitors drug1 and drug2 ( 3 mumol/liter ) potentiated the positive inotropic effects of drug3 in nonfailing myocardium ( p < 0.05 ) but not in functional class IV myocardium . 
Radioligand binding experiments using the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-3 drug1 revealed a significant decrease by approximately 30 % in drug2 uptake-1 carrier density in functional classes II to III and IV myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium ( p < 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS . 
In human heart failure , there is a presynaptic defect in the sympathetic nervous system , leading to reduced uptake-1 activity . 
This defect in the failing heart can be mimicked by the effects of uptake blocking agents , such as drug1 and drug2 , in the nonfailing heart only . 
Compromised drug1 uptake-1 in functional class IV can not be further increased by drug2 and drug3 . 
The pathophysiologic consequences could be an increased synaptic concentration of drug1 predisposing to adenylyl cyclase desensitization . 
The mechanism of drug1 - induced vasorelaxation differs in the mesenteric resistance arteries of lean and obese rats . 
drug1 has been shown to induce vasorelaxation . 
In this study , we investigated the mechanism ( s ) of drug1 - induced vasorelaxation in resistance mesenteric arteries from male lean and dietary-induced obese rats . 
Compared with lean rats , arteries from dietary-obese rats showed significant ( P < 0.001 ) endothelial dysfunction , as indicated by a decrease ( > 20 % ) in maximal acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation . 
drug1 ( 5-35 micromol/l ) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric arteries preconstricted with drug2 ( 8 micromol/l ) or drug3 ( 125 mmol/l ) from both lean and dietary-obese rats . 
There were no significant differences between the two groups , achieving a maximum relaxation of > 95 % at a concentration of 35 micromol/l . 
However , drug1 ( 100 and 300 micromol/l ) did not alter the effects of drug2 on arteries from dietary-obese rats , giving superimposed concentration-responses curves . 
drug1 was also ineffective in altering drug2 activity in arteries from both lean and dietary-obese rats . 
In drug1 - precontracted arteries from dietary-obese rats , responses to drug2 were not attenuated by endothelial denudation , indicating an action independent of the endothelium . 
This study indicates that : ( a ) the maximal effects of drug1 on resistance arteries from lean and dietary-obese rats are not effected by endothelial dysfunction , and ( b ) the effects of drug2 in lean animals ( where endothelial function is not impaired ) , but not in dietary-obese rats , are mediated via NO . 
drug1 : an IgA-binding lectin . 
We previously reported that seeds of Artocarpus integrifolia ( jackfruit ) contain a lectin , which we call drug1 , that is both a potent T cell mitogen and an apparently T cell-independent activator of human B cells for the secretion of immunoglobulins . 
During the above experiments we noted a massive precipitation in cell cultures stimulated with greater than or equal to 100 micrograms of lectin . 
In this paper , we show that the precipitate is formed after the interaction of drug1 and the serum protein added to the culture medium . 
More importantly , we demonstrate that IgA is probably the major serum constituent precipitated by the lectin and that no IgG or IgM can be detected in the precipitates . 
In secretions such as colostrum , IgA is the only protein precipitated by drug1 . 
On the basis of this specificity we describe a simple and reliable affinity chromatography procedure for the purification of both human serum and colostrum IgA . 
drug1 is a D-Gal binding lectin and should be a useful tool for studying of serum and secretory IgA . 
[ 2 epidemics of arsenical encephalopathy in the treatment of trypanosomiasis , Uganda , 1992-1993 ] Since 1988 , the french non-governmental organisation M decins Sans Fronti res is running a control program of human african trypanosomiasis in the district of Moyo , North-Uganda . 
Between 1988 and 1993 , more than 7,000 patients were diagnosed and treated . 
Since 1988 , it has been noted that incidence of drug1 reaction had increased systematically between June and October of each year , indicating strong seasonal variation . 
In 1992 and 1993 , two outbreaks of arsenical reactive encephalopathy ( ARE ) occurred in the sleeping sickness center of Adjumani . 
The incidence of ARE suddenly exceeded 10 % of the patients treated by drug1 during August 1992 and September 1993 . 
The onset of 80 % of those `` epidemic '' 
cases , occurred between the 5th and the 11th day of treatment . 
Two retrospective studies were conducted in 1992 ( 75 cases ) and in 1993 ( 51 cases ) . 
Among the risk factors studied , two appear to increase the risk of ARE : the prescription of drug1 to treat strongyloidiasis during the drug2 cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients . 
These observations suggest that exogenous co-factors could be involved in the occurrence of ARE . 
Recommendations were to avoid administration of diffusible drug1 treatment during the cure , and to improve the general conditions of patients before the cure of drug2 . 
Behavioral responses to repeated drug1 exposure in mice selectively bred for differential sensitivity to drug2 . 
Mice from the 20th generation of three lines divergently selected for response to drug1 - induced sedation times [ long-sedation time ( LST ) , short sedation time ( SST ) , and randomly bred control ( RBC ) ] were used to study drug2 - induced behavioral sensitization . 
These lines showed variable degrees of locomotor activities in response to drug1 . 
At a low drug1 dose and long withdrawal period ( 10 mg/kg , twice a day for 5 days followed by a 14-day withdrawal ) , the LST mice showed tolerance development . 
In response to drug1 , the locomotor activities of the SST were not significantly different from the RBC group . 
At a higher dose and a shorter withdrawal period ( 20 mg/kg , daily for 7 days followed by a 3-day withdrawal ) , the SST mice showed behavioral sensitization similar to the RBC mice , but the LST mice did not develop sensitization . 
The different responses in locomotor activity induced by drug1 suggest that genetic factors may play a role in determining the magnitude of response to this drug . 
Dopamine ( DA ) levels did not differ significantly in either striatum ( STR ) or nucleus accumbens ( NAC ) for the drug1 - treated animals to their corresponding saline-treated controls . 
The affinity ( Kd ) of D2 in the NAC decreased significantly , without changes in density ( Bmax ) , in the drug1 - treated SST and RBC mice . 
On the other hand , the density of D2 binding sites in the SST and the RBC mice in the STR was significantly increased in drug1 - treated groups without change in Kd . 
The LST mice did not show any changes in the Kd and Bmax in either the STR or the NAC . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that the changes in the Kd of D2 in the NAC and the Bmax of D2 in the STR may contribute to the differences in locomotor responses to drug1 exposure in these mouse lines . 
drug1 inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of drug2 . 
OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to examine the interaction between drug1 and drug2 to confirm that drug3 inhibits CYP2C9 . 
METHODS : The study was carried out as an open , randomized , crossover design with 14 healthy participants . 
In period A , all volunteers took 500 mg of drug1 orally . 
In period B , the volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups . 
Each group took either 150 mg or 75 mg of drug1 a day for 5 days ( day -3 to day 2 ) . 
The groups then took 500 mg of drug1 as a single dose ( day 0 ) . 
In both periods , blood and urine were sampled at regular intervals . 
Plasma was analyzed for drug1 , and urine was analyzed for drug2 and its two metabolites , drug3 and drug4 by means of HPLC . 
RESULTS : During treatment with drug1 , there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of drug2 , from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h , among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d . 
There was a reduction that reached borderline statistical significance in the group that received 150 mg/d of drug1 . 
The clearance by means of drug1 and drug2 was significantly reduced in both groups ( ie , from 901 mL/h to 318 mL/h in the group that received 150 mg of drug3 per day and from 723 mL/h to 457 mL/h in the group that received 75 mg of drug4 per day ) . 
Thus there was a tendency toward a more pronounced inhibition of the 4-hydroxylation during treatment with 150 mg/d of drug1 compared with 75 mg/d , but the difference was not statistically significant . 
CONCLUSION : drug1 is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vivo . 
Influence of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism . 
Available data indicate that platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism are important factors in hemostasis and regulation of vascular tone . 
Plasma membrane and intracellular mobilization of calcium ions are intimately related to platelet activation and release of platelet contents . 
Release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids as well as subsequent synthesis and release of vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 are also regulated by movement of calcium ions . 
Adenosine 3 ' :5 ' - cyclic phosphate in turn controls levels of free calcium ions in platelets and regulates calcium-dependent reactions . 
drug1 , such as drug2 , drug3 and drug4 , inhibit platelet activation in vitro , and decrease platelet adhesion intravascularly . 
These agents have also been shown to decrease platelet nucleotide release and thromboxane A2 generation . 
Some preliminary data suggest that drug1 also increase generation of vasodilator and platelet antiaggregant prostacyclin , which could contribute to decrease in platelet function . 
These effects of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism could contribute in part to their efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease . 
Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular drugs in patients with chronic renal disease . 
Cardiovascular disease is a common comorbidity and a major cause of mortality in patients with chronic renal disease . 
Drug regimens in patients with cardiovascular disease are frequently complex and can be significantly affected by alterations in renal function . 
In addition , several cardiovascular drugs directly affect renal function and the management of patients with renal disease . 
This article reviews the impact of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of cardiovascular drugs and identifies clinically important interactions between these and other drugs commonly used in the management of chronic renal disease . 
Several classes of cardiovascular drugs are also discussed in relationship to their differential effects on the management and progression of renal disease . 
Influence of drug1 and drug2 on the sensitivity of rat thoracic aorta to drug3 . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low and high doses of drug1 , and of drug2 on the response to drug3 in rat thoracic aorta . 
Two weeks after bilateral ovariectomy , female rats received a s.c. 
injection of vehicle ( corn oil , 0.1 mL/day ) , drug1 ( 10 microg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day ) and/or drug2 ( 20 mg/kg/day ) , for eight days . 
On the ninth day , the rats were sacrificed and aortic rings , with or without endothelium , were used to generate concentration-response curves to drug1 . 
Aortic rings with intact endothelium from the high-dose ( 4 mg/kg/day ) drug1 group were supersensitive to drug2 compared to the vehicle or low-dose ( 10 microg/kg/day ) estradiol groups ( pD2 values = 7.86 + / -0.09 , 7.30 + / -0.11 and 7.35 + / -0.04 , respectively ) . 
Endothelium-intact aortic rings from high - drug1 rats were supersensitive to drug2 when compared to vehicle - , drug3 - and drug4 + high - drug5 - treated rats ( pD2 values = 7.77 + / -0.12 , 7.21 + / -0.13 , 6.93 + / -0.04 and 7.22 + / -0.18 , respectively ) . 
There were no significant differences among the pD2 values for drug1 in aortic rings without endothelium . 
Both of these effects were endothelium-dependent . 
drug1 and therapeutics . 
Two different types of therapy with drug1 are used : physiological oral drug2 supplementation which is totally atoxic since it palliates drug3 deficiencies by simply normalizing the drug4 intake and pharmacological drug5 therapy which may induce toxicity since it creates iatrogenic drug6 overload . 
Primary and secondary drug1 deficiencies constitute the sole indication of physiological oral drug2 therapy . 
It is therefore necessary to be well acquainted with the clinical and paraclinical pattern of drug1 deficit and to discriminate between drug2 deficiency due to an insufficient drug3 intake which only requires oral physiological supplementation and drug4 depletion related to a dysregulation of the control mechanisms of drug5 status which requires more or less specific regulation of its causal dysregulation . 
Physiological oral drug1 load constitutes the best tool for diagnosis of drug2 deficiency and the first step of its treatment . 
Physiological oral drug1 supplementation ( 5 mg/kg/day ) is easy and can be carried out in the diet or with drug2 s , with practically only one contra-indication : overt renal failure . 
Specific and aspecific treatments of drug1 depletion are tricky using for example drug2 , pharmacological doses of drug3 , physiological doses of drug4 and of drug5 . 
In order to use the pharmacological properties of induced therapeutic hypermagnesaemia , high oral doses of drug1 ( > 10 mg/kg/day ) are advisable for chronic indications and the parenteral route is suitable for acute indications . 
There are 3 types of indications : specific ( for the treatment of some forms of drug1 deficit i.e. acute ) , pharmacological ( i.e. without alterations of drug2 status ) and mixed -- pharmacological and aetiopathogenic -- ( for example complications of chronic alcoholism ) . 
Today pharmacological drug1 therapy mainly concerns the obstetrical , cardiological and anaesthesiological fields . 
The main indications are eclampsia , some dysrhythmias ( torsades de pointe particularly ) and myocardial ischaemias . 
But it is now difficult to situate the exact place of the pharmacological indications of drug1 . 
drug1 infusions can only be envisaged in intensive care units with careful monitoring of pulse , arterial pressure , deep tendon reflexes , hourly diuresis , electrocardiogram and respiratory recordings . 
High oral drug1 doses besides their laxative action may bring latent complications which may reduce lifespan . 
There may remain some indications of the laxative and antacid properties of non soluble drug1 , particularly during intermittent haemodialysis . 
Lastly local use of the mucocutaneous and cytoprotective properties of drug1 is still valid , in drug2 and for preservation of transplants particularly . 
The effects of drug1 and drug2 upon drug3 ( drug4 ) - induced locomotion and behavioral changes in mice . 
The behavioral changes of mice induced by acute and repeated i.p. 
injection of drug1 ( drug2 ) were observed by measuring locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior . 
Then , the effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR ) agonists , drug1 and drug2 , on the above behavioral changes induced by drug3 were found . 
The effects of drug1 were very strong and completely depressed the drug2 - induced hyperlocomotion . 
The effects of drug1 were not so strong . 
Repeated injection of drug1 for 20 days into mice induced lower locomotor activity than that in acutely injected mice . 
These behavioral changes may be related with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia . 
In order to examine some molecular mechanisms of drug1 - induced behavioral changes , Northern blot analysis of total RNA from prefrontal cortical tissues of mice treated with drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 was carried out . 
Lack of an effect of drug1 on the disposition of drug2 and drug3 in HIV-infected patients . 
Two studies were conducted in HIV-infected subjects to assess the potential for drug1 to interact with drug2 and drug3 . 
Both studies used 12 subjects . 
The drug1 study dosed subjects with 1200 mg/day of drug2 ( n = 7 ) ( later changed to 600 mg/day [ n = 5 ] ) for Days 8 to 21 of a 21-day course of 100 mg , five times/day of drug3 . 
Subjects treated with 200 mg of drug1 twice daily for 21 days received 1200 mg of drug2 or an equivalent amount of placebo/day for Days 8 to 21 . 
drug1 plasma and urine sampling were conducted on Days 1 , 7 , and 21 for drug2 and on Days 7 and 21 for drug3 . 
Peripheral mononuclear cells were also collected for quantitation of phosphorylated drug1 . 
drug1 had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of drug2 , although it significantly decreased the drug3 tmax by 44 % and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated drug4 by 110 % . 
drug1 had no significant effect on drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
Based on the results of these studies , it is concluded that drug1 may be safely coadministered with both drug2 and drug3 . 
Clinical implications of drug1 interactions with five drug2 . 
The intensity , uniformity and time course of drug1 interference by drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 were systematically investigated in 16 patients receiving drug7 therapy . 
Each subject received an individualized fixed daily dose of drug1 and served as his own pre - and postsedative treatment control . 
Prothrombin times were measured four times weekly during five long-term experiments . 
Anticoagulant inhibition was observed during the administration of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ; 
there was no significant change in prothrombin test results during the trials of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 and drug2 should not be administered to patients receiving drug3 . 
The concurrent use of drugs from these groups is decreasing according to a survey of 200 hospital medical records . 
drug1 and drug2 interact pharmacologically with orally administered drug3 , but the effect is not clinically significant . 
It is concluded that drug1 and drug2 may be administered safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral drug3 therapy . 
Interaction of the constituents of alcoholic beverages in the promotion of liver damage . 
Little has been studied of the adverse effects of the exposure of the liver to the interaction of drug1 with its congeners and drug2 , coexisting in the contents of alcoholic beverages . 
Twenty four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups . 
Two groups ( SH/DA ; SH/FA ) were submitted to daily treatment with synthetic hydroalcoholic solutions containing drug1 , drug2 , higher drug3 and drug4 in the same proportions as those found in most common distilled and fermented alcoholic beverages ; 
the third group ( SH/EA ) was treated with a hydroalcoholic solution of drug1 ; 
the fourth group served as control and received an equivalent volume of an isocaloric solution of drug1 . 
All the animals were killed at the end of the 9th week of the experiment . 
The ratio between the liver weight and body weight was found to be lower in the treated animals than in the control group . 
The histology of the liver was altered in the three groups which were submitted to treatment with the hydroalcoholic solutions , with quantitative and qualitative differences between the groups . 
These results suggest that the hepatoxicity of drug1 in alcoholic beverages is enhanced by interaction with its congeners and drug2 ; 
they also suggest that alcoholic beverages are not equivalent in their potential to cause liver damage . 
Administration of drug1 prophylaxis . 
Successful prophylaxis of manic-depressive disorder requires more than the prescription of drug1 . 
The administrative arrangements in an area of Scotland were accompanied by a 300 % increase in the frequency of admissions for mania , whereas in an area of the West Midlands , a large decrease was achieved . 
Effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 in healthy volunteers . 
The authors examined the effect of the cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , drug1 , at steady state on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 following a single dose in healthy subjects . 
Each healthy subject ( N = 10 ) received drug1 ( 75 mg once daily ) or placebo for 11 days in a double-blind , randomized , balanced , two-period crossover study . 
A single 0.5 mg oral dose of drug1 elixir was administered on the 7th day of each 11-day period . 
Each treatment period was separated by 14 to 21 days . 
Samples for plasma and urine immunoreactive drug1 concentrations were collected through 120 hours following the drug2 dose . 
No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were observed for any of the calculated drug1 pharmacokinetic parameters . 
For drug1 AUC ( 0-infinity ) , AUC ( 0-24 ) , and Cmax , the geometric mean ratios ( 90 % confidence interval ) for ( drug2 + drug3 / placebo + drug4 ) were 1.04 ( 0.94 , 1.14 ) , 1.02 ( 0.94 , 1.09 ) , and 1.00 ( 0.91 , 1.10 ) , respectively . 
The drug1 median tmax was 0.5 hours for both treatments . 
The harmonic mean elimination half-life was 45.7 and 43.4 hours for drug1 + drug2 and placebo + drug3 treatments , respectively . 
drug1 is eliminated renally . 
The mean ( SD ) cumulative urinary excretion of immunoreactive drug1 after concurrent treatment with drug2 or placebo was 228.2 ( + / - 30.8 ) and 235.1 ( + / - 39.1 ) micrograms/120 hours , respectively . 
Transient and minor adverse events occurred with similar frequency on placebo and drug1 treatments , and no treatment-related pattern was apparent . 
drug1 did not influence the plasma pharmacokinetics or renal elimination of a single oral dose of drug2 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 : comparison of antiaddictive efficacy , toxicity , and mechanisms of action . 
drug1 , a novel iboga alkaloid congener , is being developed as a potential treatment for multiple forms of drug abuse . 
Like drug1 ( 40 mg/kg ) , drug2 ( 40 mg/kg ) decreases the intravenous self-administration of drug3 and drug4 and the oral self-administration of drug5 and drug6 in rats ; 
unlike drug1 , drug2 does not affect responding for a nondrug reinforcer ( water ) . 
Both drug1 and drug2 ameliorate drug3 withdrawal signs . 
Both drug1 and drug2 decrease extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens , but only drug3 increases extracellular levels of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens . 
Both drug1 and drug2 block drug3 - induced and drug4 - induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens ; 
only drug1 enhances drug2 - induced increases in accumbal dopamine . 
Both drug1 and drug2 enhance the locomotor and/or stereotypic effects of stimulants . 
drug1 attenuates , but drug2 potentiates , the acute locomotor effects of drug3 ; 
both compounds attenuate drug1 - induced locomotion in drug2 - experienced rats . 
drug1 produces whole body tremors and , at high doses ( > or = 100 mg/kg ) , cerebellar damage ; 
drug1 does not produce these effects . 
drug1 , but not drug2 , decreases heart rate at high doses . 
While drug1 and drug2 have similar affinities for kappa opioid and possibly nicotinic receptors , drug3 has much lower affinities than drug4 for NMDA and sigma-2 receptors , sodium channels , and the 5-HT transporter . 
Both drug1 and drug2 are sequestered in fat and , like drug3 , drug4 probably has an active metabolite . 
The data suggest that drug1 has a narrower spectrum of actions and will have a substantially greater therapeutic index than drug2 . 
Effect of coadministered drugs and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drugs to human serum in vitro . 
The effects of coadministered drugs and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drugs to human serum in vitro was investigated . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 were added to pooled human serum at therapeutic concentrations . 
To each preparation was added one additional drug at three concentrations ranging from therapeutic to toxic . 
The following eight target drug/added drug combinations were studied : drug1 / drug2 . 
drug1 / drug2 , drug3 / drug4 , drug5 / drug6 , drug7 / drug8 , drug9 / drug10 , drug11 / drug12 , and drug13 / drug14 . 
Each serum without the other added drug as well as the serum supplemented with the other drug at the three concentrations was dialyzed against phosphate buffer . 
Similarly dialyzed were drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 , both alone at therapeutic concentrations in serum and with drug4 at three different concentrations in serum . 
The percentage of drug binding in each preparation was calculated . 
drug1 diminished the binding of drug2 to human serum by a net change of 5.7 % ( percentage increase in free drug fraction [ FDF ] , 11.0 % ) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 13.7 % ) at 1324 micromol/L . 
drug1 decreased the binding of drug2 by a net change of 6.8 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 8.8 % ) at 277.5 micromol/L ; 
drug1 reduced it by a net change of 6.6 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 8.5 % ) at 431 micromol/L . 
drug1 diminished binding of drug2 by a net change of 9.9 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 21.2 % ) at 1732 micromol/L . 
No significant effects were noted with other drug combinations or with the addition of drug1 . 
Coingestion of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 with drug4 , and drug5 with drug6 at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug . 
The resulting increase in free drug concentration may lead to enhanced drug effect in vivo . 
Effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
The effect of drug1 on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug2 was evaluated in a randomized , double-blind study . 
Five days of drug1 treatment did not significantly affect steady-state pharmacokinetic variables of drug2 compared with placebo ; 
therefore , the use of drug1 does not necessitate an adjustment in drug2 dose to maintain therapeutic digoxin levels . 
Acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of drug1 in anhydrous and aqueous drug2 solutions . 
The drug1 are a family of drug2 and drug3 . 
When taken concurrently with drug1 , a pharmacological interaction may occur , potentiating the central nervous system depression produced by either drug . 
In addition to this pharmacological interaction , this report describes a novel chemical reaction between drug1 ( a drug2 ) and drug3 under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo , resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product . 
Optimal conditions , kinetics , equilibrium , and the mechanism of this acid-catalyzed ethanolysis are reported . 
The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume drug1 and drug2 on a regular basis . 
The acid-catalyzed drug1 - drug reaction is a relatively unexplored area and may alter the pharmacological action of some drugs . 
Inhibitory effects of drug1 on inositol 1,4 , 5-trisphosphate-induced responses in rat megakaryocytes . 
The effects of drug1 ( drug2 ) on drug3 ( drug4 ) - induced responses were studied in rat bone marrow megakaryocytes with the patch-clamp whole-cell recording technique in combination with fura-2 microfluorometry . 
Internal application of drug1 ( 100 microM ) increased intracellular Ca ( 2 + ) concentration ( [ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) ) and activated the Ca ( 2 + ) - dependent K ( + ) current . 
Administering drug1 together with drug2 ( 100-500 microM ) inhibited InsP ( 3 ) - induced responses ( both Ca ( 2 + ) and current responses ) in a dose-dependent fashion . 
Pretreatment of megakaryocytes with extracellular drug1 ( 50 microM ) also inhibited drug2 - induced responses . 
Intracellular and extracellular application of drug1 reduced ADP-induced increases in [ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) . 
In contrast , in isolated single pancreatic acinar cells , drug1 had no effect on drug2 - induced responses . 
Taken together , these results suggest that the site of the inhibitory action of drug1 is at the InsP ( 3 ) receptor , or its closely associated proteins . 
In addition , we have shown that drug1 is a useful pharmacological tool with which to examine the drug2 - mediated responses of megakaryocytes . 
Concomitant drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 chemotherapy plus drug5 therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related , non-Hodgkin lymphoma . 
BACKGROUND : The feasibility and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and drug1 therapy ( HAART ) is still unknown in patients with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - related malignancies . 
To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy plus HAART on the clinical course of patients with HIV-related , systemic , non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( HIV-NHL ) , the authors compared retrospectively a group of 24 patients with HIV-NHL who were treated with the drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ( CHOP ) chemotherapy regimen plus HAART with a group of 80 patients who were treated with CHOP chemotherapy or a CHOP-like regimen ( i.e. , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 with drug9 plus drug10 ) without receiving drug11 therapy . 
METHODS : All patients were enrolled in two sequential trials performed at the Aviano Cancer Center , Italy , from April 1988 to December 1998 . 
HAART was included with combination therapy from January 1997 . 
drug1 regimens consisted of two drug2 and one drug3 . 
RESULTS : The two treatment groups were well matched with regard to patient demographics , NHL characteristics , HIV status , and treatment , i.e. , the number of cycles and chemotherapy dose . 
The response rates were similar between the two groups . 
Severe anemia ( Grade 3-4 according to the World Health Organization criteria ) was significantly greater in the patients who received CHOP-HAART compared with the patients who received CHOP alone ( 33 % vs. 7 % , respectively ; P = 0.001 ) . 
Leukopenia was similar between the two groups , but colony stimulating factor support was significantly greater in the CHOP-HAART group than in the control group ( 92 % vs. 66 % , respectively ; P = 0.03 ) . 
Seventeen percent of CHOP-HAART patients developed severe autonomic neurotoxicity , whereas none of the CHOP patients developed neurotoxicity ( P = 0.002 ) . 
At similar median follow-up , opportunistic infection ( OI ) rates and mortality were significantly lower in the CHOP-HAART patients than in the CHOP patients ( 18 % vs. 52 % , respectively ; P = 0.05 ; and 38 % vs. 85 % , respectively ; P = 0.001 ) . 
The median survival for CHOP-HAART patients was not reached , whereas the medial survival of CHOP patients was 7 months ( P = 0.03 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of CHOP plus HAART is feasible and may reduce the morbidity from OIs in HIV-NHL patients . 
However , careful attention must be directed to cross toxicity and possible pharmacokinetic interactions between drug1 and drug2 . 
The impact of the combined chemotherapy plus HAART treatment on patient survival needs urgently to be evaluated in prospective studies . 
drug1 and drug2 : a drug interaction . 
The drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 is not well known . 
drug1 has been reported to increase the drug2 requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 resulted in the need for an unusually high maintenance dose of drug3 ( 20 mg per day ) in order to produce a therapeutic effect . 
Withdrawal of drug1 decreased the drug2 requirement by 50 % . 
This effect may be mediated by the ability of drug1 to induce microsomal enzymes and , thus , the catabolism of drug2 . 
The effect of drug1 on the drug2 requirement of our patient appeared to be maximal 5 to 7 days after the initiation of drug3 and extended a similar length of time after drug4 withdrawal . 
This interaction appears to be clinically significant . 
Increased stability of nucleophosmin/B23 in anti-apoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
We obtained evidence that increased stability of nucleophosmin/B23 is involved in antiapoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
Nucleophosmin/B23 in serum-deprived ( 0 % serum ) NIH-3T3 cells was found to be highly unstable with a half-life less than 4 h . 
In contrast , nucleophosmin/B23 in serum-deprived ras-transformed ( RAS-3T3 ) cells was as stable as that in serum-supplemented NIH-3T3 or RAS-3T3 cells . 
Treatment of RAS-3T3 cells with nucleophosmin/B23 antisense oligomer significantly potentiated the apoptosis induced by serum deprivation . 
Much less caspase-3 activity was noted in the lysate derived from serum-deprived RAS-3T3 cells compared with that in the lysate of serum-deprived NIH-3T3 cells . 
Cell permeable caspase-3 inhibitor added in the medium blocked the decrease of nucleophosmin/B23 and apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in NIH-3T3 cells . 
The inhibitor , on the other hand , promoted significant decrease of nucleolin/C23 in NIH-3T3 cells during serum deprivation . 
Unlike nucleolin/C23 , down-regulation of nucleophosmin/B23 was thus not proliferation-dependent but caspase-3 - and apoptosis-dependent . 
Our results indicate important relationships among ras , nucleophosmin/B23 , activation of caspase-3 , and induction of apoptosis . 
drug1 : mammalian target of drug2 inhibitor to prevent kidney rejection . 
Current immunosuppressive therapies are effective but can be associated with significant adverse reactions . 
drug1 works differently from the drug2 currently available , and except for increased lipid levels , the adverse reaction profile of drug3 does not appear to overlap to any great extent with that associated with drug4 or drug5 . 
While additional research is needed , the initial clinical data in kidney recipients suggest that drug1 , in combination with drug2 or drug3 , might have the potential to reduce the frequency of rejection episodes , permit reductions in drug4 or drug5 dosage , and permit steroid withdrawal ( Kelly , 1999 ) . 
Development and pharmacology of drug1 . 
drug1 is the first drug2 to be approved for clinical use , and has been studied extensively in humans since 1986 . 
It is structurally distinct from the other currently available drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ) , leading to unique biopharmaceutical properties relative to the other agents of this class . 
Absorption of drug1 is virtually complete across all species , including man , and is not affected by the presence of food . 
Systemic exposure is limited , as drug1 is subject to first-pass metabolism , and the plasma half-life of the drug is approximately 30 minutes . 
Some 95 % of a single dosage of drug1 is excreted via the biliary route , with less than 2 % of this being the parent compound . 
Additionally , there is no evidence of circulating active metabolites or accumulation during chronic dosing . 
Studies of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of drug1 have demonstrated marked reductions in the rate of bioavailability -- from 40 % to 60 % ; 
however , a comparison of drug1 administration with the evening meal or at bedtime has revealed no significant differences in the extent of bioavailability ( area under the curve ) of these two regimens . 
Furthermore , no significant difference in pharmacodynamic effect ( reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ) could be ascertained between mealtime dosing and bedtime dosing . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 have also been assessed in various demographic groups . 
Relative to the general population , plasma concentrations of drug1 do not vary as a function of either age or gender . 
In addition , administration to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in both the rate and extent of bioavailability relative to controls . 
Also , although minimal alterations of drug1 clearance in patients with renal insufficiency are anticipated due to limited renal excretion ( 5 % ) , a study in this patient group is currently underway to examine this further . 
Interaction studies have been performed with drug1 and several drugs with which it might be coadministered . 
drug1 , an anionic-binding resin , has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of drug2 bioavailability . 
Although this effect was noted even when drug1 was given 4 hours prior to drug2 , this regimen did not result in diminished efficacy . 
Further , no effects on either drug1 levels or prothrombin times were observed in a study involving concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 . 
Moreover , additional interaction studies with drug1 and drug2 have not demonstrated any effect on drug3 plasma levels , and administration to a patient population chronically receiving drug4 resulted in no difference in the extent of bioavailability of drug5 relative to control data . 
The results generated to date in clinical pharmacokinetic studies with drug1 thus support its use in a broad population of hypercholesterolaemic patients . 
Molecular basis for the selective toxicity of drug1 for yeast and drug2 for animal cells . 
Among the drug1 , many , like drug2 , can not be used clinically because they are toxic ; 
drug1 , however , is useful in therapy of human fungal infections because it is less toxic . 
Both the toxicity of drug1 and the therapeutic value of drug2 can be rationalized at the cellular and molecular level by the following observations : ( i ) these drug3 showed differential effects on cells ; 
drug1 was more potent in lysing human red blood cells , whereas drug2 was more potent in inhibiting yeast cell growth ; 
and ( ii ) the effects of drug1 were more efficiently inhibited by added cholesterol , the major membrane sterol in human cells , whereas the effects of drug2 were more efficiently inhibited by ergosterol , the major membrane sterol in yeast . 
The simplest inference is that the toxicity and effectiveness of polyenes are determined by their relative avidities for the predominant sterol in cell membranes . 
[ Hippocampus as interaction sites between cerebral memory systems ] Most of the current theories assume that there are multiple forms of memory that are supported by separate brain systems and have different characteristics . 
Animals studies on the various dual-memory theories have been carried out mainly on the basis of hippocampal system function . 
Specifically , they have focused on aspects of learning and memory that are impaired ( vs. spared ) by lesions of the hippocampal formation . 
However , there are several instances in the animal literature showing that hippocampal lesions actually produced enhanced learning and memory function . 
Moreover , the acquisition of tasks that are facilitated by hippocampal lesions ( or dysfunction ) is nevertheless associated , in intact subjects , with specific neurobiological alterations in the hippocampus . 
This problem has been analysed using two different tasks in mice : a bar-press conditioning and a spatial discrimination task . 
Results showed that , depending on the task considered , the same pharmacological treatment produced either a facilitation or an impairment of acquisition . 
Moreover , each task induced significant alterations in hippocampal adenylate cyclase activity but in opposite directions . 
Together with previous findings , these results suggest that the hippocampus is involved in both the so-called `` hippocampal-dependent '' 
`` hippocampal-independent '' 
forms of memory . 
It is postulated that some of the observed training-induced neurobiological alterations might reflect the interaction between two ( or more ) competing memory systems at the hippocampal level . 
Thus , in addition to its proposed specific information processing functions ( i.e. , relational ) , the hippocampus would play a role in addressing information to the brain memory system that , in a given situation , has the best adaptive value . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Behavioral mechanisms underlying the link between smoking and drinking . 
Many people use both drug1 and drug2 ( i.e. , cigarettes and other tobacco products ) . 
The behavioral effects of these two drugs differ , and they do not act on the same target sites in the brain , although they may share , or partly share , certain properties . 
The initiation of drug1 or drug2 use may be precipitated by similar personality characteristics in the user , such as impulsivity and sensation seeking . 
Moreover , the mechanisms underlying the development of dependence may be similar for drug1 and drug2 . 
Thus , certain factors , such as reinforcing drug effects , conditioning processes , automatic behavior , and stress , may influence the development of dependence on both drugs . 
Other factors , such as tolerance and sensitization to the drugs ' actions and the development of withdrawal symptoms , may also contribute to dependence . 
This review discusses the actions of the two drugs on certain brain chemical ( i.e. , neurotransmitter ) systems and the extent to which the effects of the two drugs may interact . 
Vancomycin resistance reversal in enterococci by flavonoids . 
The development of clinical vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci ( VRE ) is a major cause for concern . 
Here we show that a combination of drug1 or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone with drug2 may be used to sensitize resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium to the level of vancomycin-sensitive strains . 
Minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) and viable counts were determined in Iso-sensitest broth using a microtitre method . 
MICs of drug1 against 67 % of resistant clinical isolates and a type strain of enterococci were lowered from > 250 microg mL ( -1 ) to 1 
4 microg mL ( -1 ) in the presence of drug1 ( 12.5 microg mL ( -1 ) ) or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone ( 6.25 microg mL ( -1 ) ) . 
Viable counts for type culture E. 
faecalis ATCC 51299 showed the flavonoids alone significantly lowered numbers of colony forming units ( CFUs ) . 
CFUs were maintained at low levels ( 10 ( 3 ) CFU mL ( -1 ) ) for 24 h by drug1 / flavone combinations . 
This combinational action in reversing vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlights novel drug targets and has importance in the design of new therapeutic regimes against resistant pathogens . 
Lack of interaction between drug1 and drug2 : pharmacokinetics and drug disposition . 
Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of drug1 and drug2 when administered concomitantly with an intravenous drug3 such as drug4 . 
This decrease in absorption results in a 36 % and 50 % lower AUC for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , which could cause clinical failures . 
The authors investigated the possibility of a similar interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
Eight healthy volunteers were randomized in an open-label , two-way crossover study to receive drug1 , 5 mg p.o. 
Q4H , and drug1 , 500 mg p.o. 
1 hour after starting the drug1 or drug2 500 mg p.o. 
alone . 
Blood samples were drawn at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 , and 24 hours for Cmax , tmax , and AUC determinations . 
There was not a significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) in AUC ( 48.59 + / - 8.52 vs. 49.9 + / - 9.93 ) , Cmax ( 7.73 + / - 2.6 vs. 6.6 + / - 2.0 ) , and tmax ( 1.1 + / - 0.6 vs. 1.6 + / - 1.1 ) for drug1 versus drug2 / drug3 regimens . 
It was concluded that oral drug1 and drug2 can be administered concomitantly without a significant decrease in AUC , Cmax , or tmax . 
The mode of toxic action of the pesticide drug1 : the metabolism of drug2 to drug3 . 
The biochemical toxicology of drug1 , a known metabolite of the major ingredient of the pesticide drug2 ( drug3 ) , was investigated in vivo and in vitro . 
Rat kidney homogenates supplemented with coenzyme A , ATP , oxaloacetate , and Mg2 + converted drug1 to drug2 in vitro . 
Administration of drug1 ( 100 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) to rats in vivo resulted in drug2 synthesis in the kidney , which was preceded by an elevation in fluoride levels and followed by citrate accumulation . 
Animals dosed with drug1 did not display the 2-3 hour lag phase in either drug2 synthesis or in citrate and fluoride accumulation characteristic of animals dosed with drug3 . 
We demonstrate that the conversion of drug1 to drug2 by an NAD + - dependent oxidation is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the toxic product , drug3 from drug4 . 
Prior administration of drug1 ( 90 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) was shown to prevent the conversion of drug2 ( 100 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) to drug3 in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in drug4 - intoxicated animals . 
However , administration of drug1 ( 90 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) to rats 2 hours prior to drug2 ( 100 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) was ineffective in preventing drug3 synthesis and did not diminish fluoride or citrate accumulation in vivo . 
We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of drug1 seen in animals treated with drug2 derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD + - dependent oxidation responsible for converting drug3 to drug4 in the committed step of the toxic pathway . 
drug1 - induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver is prevented by drug2 or drug3 . 
Considering that the involvement of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) has been implicated in the toxicity of various pesticides , this study was designed to investigate the possibility of oxidative stress induction by drug1 , a drug2 . 
Either single ( 170 mg/kg ) or repeated ( 75 mg/kg per day for 5 days ) oral administration of drug1 was found to produce significant oxidative stress in cerebral and hepatic tissues of rats , as was evident by the elevation of the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) in both tissues , either 4 or 24 h after treatment . 
Much higher changes were observed in liver , increasing from a level of 60 % at 4 h up to nearly 4 times the control at 24 h for single dose . 
Reduced levels ( up to 20 % ) of total glutathione ( total GSH ) , and elevation of conjugated dienes ( approximately 60 % in liver by single dose at 4 h ) also indicated the presence of an oxidative insult . 
Glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) activity , however , did not differ from control values for any dose or at any time point in cerebral and hepatic tissues . 
Pretreatment of rats with drug1 ( 100 mg/kg , ip ) or drug2 ( 100 mg/kg per day , ig , for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day ) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues , induced by single high dose of oral drug3 administration within 4 h. 
Thus , the results suggest that drug1 exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage , as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation , which was prevented by drug2 and drug3 . 
Serum drug1 levels using an 125I-labelled antigen : Validation of method and observations on cardiac patients . 
1 . 
Determinations of serum drug1 levels utilizing commercially available kits with an 125I-labelled antigen were precise and not materially different from results obtained with a 3H-labelled antigen . 
2 . 
In order to approximate the steady state level , serum drug1 levels should be drawn either before or at least six hours following the administration of an oral tablet . 
3 . 
Concomitantly given drug1 did not interfere with the absorption of a tablet of drug2 . 
4 . 
In the digitalized patient , slow alterations in serum levels after oral administration appeared well correlated with , at least , the negative chronotropic effects of the drug . 
5 . 
Maximal exercise testing , a maneuver often applied to cardiac patients , does not significantly alter the serum drug1 level . 
Analysis of drug1 - induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats . 
The drug1 ( drug2 ) - induced diarrhea was analyzed in cecectomized rats prepared by resecting the cecum and its vasculature without disturbing the ileocecal junction . 
drug1 ( 0.1-1 .0 mg/kg , p.o. ) 
dose-dependently increased the number of defecation episodes and induced a soft and watery stool in cecectomized rats . 
At 0.3 mg/kg , the diarrhea-inducing effects of drug1 were more pronounced in cecectomized than in control rats . 
When given i.p. , drug1 ( 0.3 mg/kg ) induced a watery stool in cecectomized and control rats with the same efficacy , although these effects were short-lasting as compared to oral administration . 
drug1 ( 4 ml/kg , p.o. ) 
also induced diarrhea , but did not produce a watery stool in cecectomized rats . 
There were no differences between cecectomized and control rats in basal small intestinal transits or in drug1 ( 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. ) - induced enhancements . 
Moreover , the basal and drug1 - induced jejunal net fluid transfers were the same in cecectomized and in control rats . 
On the other hand , the enhanced secretion of colonic fluid by drug1 , given intraluminally , was only half of that in control rats , whereas the colonic transit-enhancing effect of drug2 in cecectomized rats was more pronounced than in control rats at 15 but not at 30 min after its administration . 
The basal colonic fluid contents and transits were the same in cecectomized and in control rats . 
drug1 and drug2 ( 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. ) 
drug1 and drug2 ( 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. ) inhibited the drug3 ( 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. ) - induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats . 
drug1 ( 5 mg/kg , s.c. ) 
drug1 ( 5 mg/kg , s.c. ) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of drug2 and partly antagonized the effect of drug3 . 
These results suggest that oral administration of drug1 induces a more pronounced secretory diarrhea in cecectomized than in control rats , probably due to the lack of the reservoir function of the cecum in the operated animals . 
This secretory diarrhea model is suitable for evaluating the antidiarrheal activity of drugs . 
drug1 as potent drug2 of glucocorticoid-induced mouse mammary tumor virus gene expression . 
The effect of natural and synthetic galloyl esters on glucocorticoid-induced gene expression was evaluated by using rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional regulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus drug1 . 
The glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription was strongly suppressed by synthetic alkyl esters ; 
drug1 showed the most potent inhibition ( 66 % inhibition at 10 microM ) , which was far more potent than that of crude drug2 . 
n-Octyl and n-cetyl gallate also showed good inhibition , while gallic acid itself was not so active , suggesting that the presence of hydrophobic side chain is important for the suppressive effect . 
On the other hand , surprisingly , drug1 , ( - ) - epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate and theasinensin A , potently enhanced the promoter activity ( 182 and 247 % activity at 1 microM , respectively ) . 
The regulation of the level of the glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by the antioxidative gallates is of great interest from a therapeutic point of view . 
High-dose drug1 with drug2 protection . 
Nephrotoxicity frequently limits the dose of drug1 to less than 120 mg/m2 per injection . 
drug1 is a neutralizing agent for drug2 that protects against renal damage . 
To determine whether injection of drug1 would permit larger doses of drug2 to be administered , a fixed 9.9-g / m2 dose of drug3 was given intravenously over three hours concurrently with escalating doses of drug4 . 
drug1 was administered over the last two hours of the drug2 infusion . 
Using this technique , it was possible to escalate the drug1 dose to 225 mg/m2 before dose-limiting toxicities were encountered . 
Comparison of drug1 pharmacokinetics in patients treated with 202.5 mg/m2 plus drug2 to those in patients treated with 100 mg/m2 without drug3 indicated that there were no changes in the elimination rate constant , volume of distribution , or total body clearance of drug4 . 
The total drug exposure for the plasma was approximately twofold at the higher drug1 dose . 
This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of drug1 permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to drug2 . 
Interaction on the antinociceptive effect between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 . 
The aim of this paper was to study the interaction between drug1 and both drug2 or its synthetic analogue drug3 , or drug4 , on the antinonciceptive effect of these peptides in mice after intracisternal injection . 
Antinociception was measured by the hot-plate method . 
It was shown that drug1 antagonized evidently the antinociceptive effect of drug2 and their analogue . 
On the contrary , drug1 and drug2 were agonists in induction of analgesia . 
It is concluded that drug1 modulates in an opposite way the function of the enkephalinergic neurons and the central action of drug2 . 
The emerging roles of drug1 in drug2 therapy . 
The availability of potent drug1 ( drug2 ) - based regimens for drug3 therapy and concerns regarding drug4 ( drug5 ) - related metabolic disturbances have led to significant shifts in treatment practices in HIV infection . 
drug1 - based regimens may have several advantages over drug2 - based therapy for initial or prolonged therapy , including more convenient administration regimens , lower tablet volume , fewer drug interactions , and central nervous system penetration . 
No data from prospective clinical trials currently exist comparing the 3 approved agents ( drug1 , drug2 or drug3 ) . 
Both drug1 and drug2 have been compared to triple therapy with the drug3 drug4 over 48 weeks as initial therapy , with similar responses being observed with drug5 regimens and superiority observed with drug6 . 
A smaller 24-week study has suggested drug1 may be superior to the drug2 drug3 . 
Limited comparative data in patients with high viral loads treated with drug1 - or drug2 - based regimens currently exist . 
However , cohort data and selected patient data from clinical trials suggest comparable activity to drug1 - based regimens in these patients . 
The superiority of drug1 over drug2 - based regimens has been observed in comparative data in a subset of patients with high viral loads . 
In treatment-experienced patients , available uncontrolled data suggest these agents contribute to regimen efficacy in drug1 - na ve , treatment-experienced patients . 
drug1 has demonstrated superiority over drug2 in nucleoside-experienced patients , although combining these 2 agents may represent the best approach in these circumstances . 
The tolerability of drug1 appears generally good with few individuals discontinuing in clinical studies as a result of adverse drug events . 
The majority of adverse events with drug1 occur within the first month , and are predictable and manageable without therapy interruption . 
Suppression by drug1 of drug2 - enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by drug3 in wistar rats . 
BACKGROUND : The effects of combined administration of drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) , a drug4 , on the incidence of peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by drug5 ( drug6 ) and the labeling index of intestinal cancers were investigated in male Wistar rats . 
METHODS : From the beginning of the experiment , rats were given 10 weekly subcutaneous injections of drug1 ( 7.4 mg/kg body weight ) and subcutaneous injections of drug2 ( 40 microg/kg body weight ) every other day , and from week 16 , intraperitoneal injections of drug3 ( 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight ) every other day until the end fo the experiment in week 45 . 
RESULTS : drug1 significantly increased the incidence of intestinal tumors and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum . 
Although drug1 administered at either dose had little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by drug2 or on the location , histologic type , depth of involvement , labeling index , apoptotic index or tumor vascularity of intestinal cancers , it significantly decreased the incidence of cancer metastasis . 
drug1 also significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinomas , which was enhanced by drug2 . 
CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that drug1 inhibits cancer metastasis through actions that do not affect the growth of intestinal cancers . 
[ Dose-time effects of competitive displacement of drug1 by drug2 following oral and intravenous administration ] The effect of various doses of drug3 in several dose fractions on the extent and the time scale of displacement of drug4 , in dependence on application mode , was studied . 
An intravenous dose of 50 mg drug1 was in respect of competitive suppression of organs actively concentrating drug2 as effective as intravenous 1000 mg ClO-4 - simultaneously or 1000 mg orally 30 min before the injection of drug3 . 
An intravenous injection of drug1 given later also produces a complete and immediately beginning depletion of drug2 already accumulated in the thyroid , within a period of 195 min after 99m-TcO-4-injection with a corresponding increase in blood levels . 
20 mg result in incomplete depletion which becomes complete after a second additional dose . 
The intravenous application of drug1 offers advantages in clinical use . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 : effects on drug discrimination and behavioral inhibition in rats . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) produces psychotomimetic effects in humans that resemble schizophrenia symptoms . 
In an effort to screen compounds for antipsychotic activity , preclinical researchers have investigated whether these compounds block drug1 - induced behaviors in animals . 
In the present study , the drug1 drug2 was tested in combination with an active dose of drug3 in two-lever drug discrimination and mixed signalled-unsignalled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rates ( DRL ) procedures . 
drug1 produced distinctive effects in each task : it substituted for the training dose in drug2 discrimination and it increased the number of responses with short ( < 3 s ) interresponse times as well as increasing overall response rates in the DRL schedule . 
Acute dosing with drug1 failed to alter the behavioral effects of drug2 in either procedure even when tested up to doses that produced pharmacological effects alone . 
These results suggest that acute dosing with drug1 would not affect behaviors most closely associated with drug2 intoxication . 
Further , they bring into question the utility of using drug1 combination procedures in animals to screen for antipsychotic potential . 
Since chronic dosing is required for therapeutic efficacy of drug1 , future studies should focus on investigation of chronic dosing effects of these drugs in combination with drug2 . 
[ Multiple occupational exposure to solvents ] This article review papers published over the last 20 years on multiple occupational exposure to solvents . 
At low-levels of exposure the toxicokinetic interferences between solvents have generally not been observed in man and presumably a threshold limit exists . 
Conversely , at exposure levels close to the `` limit values '' 
metabolic interference has sometimes been observed and the behaviour of the biological indicators differs from what would be expected . 
Toxicodynamic interference between solvents can give rise to additive , potentiation , synergistic , antagonistic effects . 
For the identification of `` limit values '' , it has generally been suggested in the literature that the possible effects deriving from multiple exposure be considered as additive . 
However , numerous potentiation effects have frequently been reported for combined exposure to substances of widespread use . 
In this paper lists of multiple exposure in which the doses of the substances , the types of interferences and the behaviour of the biological levels have been drawn up and proposed as a tool for easy consultation . 
drug1 and drug2 exert additive ocular and renal vasodilator effects on healthy humans . 
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : There is evidence that drug1 and drug2 cause renal and ocular vasodilation . 
There is , however , currently no data on the effect of combined hyperglycaemia and hyper drug1 aemia on the renal and ocular blood flow seen in diabetic patients on insulin therapy . 
METHODS : We carried out two different 3-way crossover studies in healthy subjects ( each , n = 9 ) . 
In study one , hyperglycaemic clamps ( 5.6 mmol/l , 11.1 mmol / 1 , 16.7 mmol/l ) were carried out during placebo or drug1 ( dose 1 : 1 mU/kg/min ; dose 2 : 2 mU/kg/min ) infusion . 
The second study was identical but endogenous insulin secretion was blocked with drug1 . 
The renal plasma flow , glomerular filtration rate and pulsatile choroidal blood flow were measured using the paraaminohippurate method , the inulin method and a laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude , respectively . 
RESULTS : drug1 increased renal plasma flow and fundus pulsation amplitude but not the glomerular filtration rate . 
Hyperglycaemia increased all the renal and ocular parameters studied . 
Haemodynamic effects of drug1 and drug2 were additive when drug3 was co-administered but not under basal conditions . 
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : drug1 and drug2 can exert additive vasodilator properties on renal and ocular circulation . 
To find out whether this observation is related to the increased regional perfusion in diabetes longitudinal studies on patients with Type I ( insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus are needed . 
Interaction between drug1 and antidiuretic hormone and its effect on the milk secretion by alveoli of the mammary gland of lactating rats . 
Interaction between exogenous and endogenous drug1 and vasopressin was found to affect the mechanism of milk ejection by the alveoli of the mammary gland in lactating rats . 
Inhibition and stimulation of the effect of drug1 on milk ejection by vasopressin was demonstrated . 
On the basis of the principles observed the concentrations fo these hormones were investigated in the plasma of dogs deprived of water for 3 days and then allowed to drink . 
[ Quantitative approach to treatment with incisive drug1 by therapeutic monitoring ] ; The problems encountered during the longterm treatment of psychotic patients with drug2 are illustrated by six typical case reports . 
A group of patients who had had a new acute episode despite seemingly adequate treatment were selected . 
In these six cases it was demonstrated that the drug1 dosage was inappropriate , being either too high or too low as judged from the plasma concentrations . 
Ways of improving the adequacy of the treatment of psychotic patients with drug1 are discussed . 
Longitudinal assessment of drug1 in de novo renal transplant recipients over the first post-transplant year : pharmacokinetics , exposure-response relationships , and influence on drug2 . 
OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug1 and drug2 ( INN , drug3 ) when coadministered in de novo kidney allograft recipients during the first year after transplantation . 
METHOD : This study was a multicenter randomized double-blind study of 101 patients who were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive drug1 tablets at doses of 0.5 mg , 1 mg , or 2 mg twice daily with drug2 and drug3 . 
Blood sampling for the pharmacokinetics of drug1 and drug2 was performed on day 1 , on weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , and on months 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 . 
drug1 dose-proportionality and stability over time were assessed in the context of linear regression and ANOVA models . 
drug1 exposure-response relationships between area under the blood concentration-time curve ( AUC ) and changes in platelets , leukocytes , and lipids were explored with the median-effect model . 
Potential differences in drug1 dosing and pharmacokinetics at different levels of drug2 exposure were assessed in the context of ANOVA . 
RESULTS : drug1 steady state was reached on or before day 7 , with a median 3-fold accumulation of drug exposure compared with that after the first postoperative dose . 
Both steady-state maximum concentration and AUC were dose proportional over the full dose range when assessed on day 1 , as well as for the full duration of the study at steady state . 
There was evidence for longitudinal stability in AUC of drug1 during the course of the study . 
The interindividual pharmacokinetic variability for AUC was 85.4 % and intraindividual , interoccasion variability was 40.8 % . 
Age ( range , 17-69 years ) , weight ( range , 49-106 kg ) , and sex ( 65 men and 36 women ) were not significant contributors to variability . 
There was an increasing incidence of transient thrombocytopenia ( or = 100 x 10 ( 9 ) / L ) with increasing drug1 AUC ( P = .03 ) . 
drug1 doses , trough concentrations , and AUC exhibited similar temporal patterns during the course of the study regardless of the co-administered drug2 dose level ( P = .13 , .82 , and .76 , respectively ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 exhibited dose-proportional , stable exposure during the first post-transplant year . 
For a 4-fold range of drug1 doses there were no differential effects on drug2 dosing or pharmacokinetics . 
Toxicity of cadmium and drug1 to encystment and in vitro excystment of Parorchis acanthus ( Digenea : Philophthalmidae ) . 
The toxicity of cadmium , drug1 and cadmium/zinc mixtures at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 50000 microg/l were investigated against cercariae and metacercariae of Parorchis acanthus obtained from the dog whelk Nucella lapillus . 
Cercarial encystment at concentrations of 25000 microg/l or higher was significantly impaired by all test metals ; 
however , at lower concentrations only drug1 demonstrated toxicity . 
Mixtures of cadmium and drug1 had a synergistic effect compared with single metal toxicity but only at 50000 microg/l . 
Excystment in vitro was only significantly affected by cercariae exposed to cadmium/zinc mixtures whilst encysting . 
Twenty-four h exposures of fully formed cysts had no effect on excystment in vitro . 
Effects on in vitro excystment rates over a 2 h period demonstrated widespread effects for cercariae-exposed P. 
acanthus . 
No effects were evident on excystment rates of cyst-exposed parasites .
