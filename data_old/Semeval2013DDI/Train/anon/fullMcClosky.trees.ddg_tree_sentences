The concomitant intake of drug1 and drug2 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug3 or drug4 . 
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that administration of drug1 or drug2 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
Co-administration of drug1 with drug2 produced a 25 % increase in AUC and a 33 % increase in the Cmax of drug3 . 
No adjustment of dosage is recommended in such patients . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 and its major metabolite drug2 were unaffected following co-administration with drug3 . 
Other concomitant therapies : In clinical trials , the safety profile in subjects treated with drug1 concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ( including drug5 ) , or drug6 was similar to that of subjects taking placebo with these concomitant medications . 
Patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 more commonly reported both weight gain and weight loss , compared with patients taking either medication alone . 
Drug interactions between drug1 and other drugs have not been fully evaluated . 
Drugs which may potentiate the release of neutrophils , such as drug1 , should be used with caution . 
drug1 may augment the activity of other drug2 . 
Concomitant use with other drug1 is not recommended . 
drug1 is highly bound to human plasma protein ( mean 99.2 % ) . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 The in vitro binding of drug5 to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by drug6 ( 99.5 % control vs 99.3 % ) when drug7 plasma concentrations reach 5 to10 m g/mL . 
drug1 does not alter drug2 protein binding . 
In vitro studies indicate that , at therapeutic concentrations of drug1 ( 300 m g/mL ) , the binding of drug2 was reduced from approximately 99.2 % to 97.5 % , representing a potential twofold increase in unbound drug3 plasma levels . 
Therapeutic concentrations of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 andtolbutamide did not alter drug8 protein binding . 
In a study involving 12 adult volunteers , TORADOLORAL was coadministered with a single dose of 25 mg drug1 , causing no significant changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drug2 . 
In another study , TORADOLIV/IM was given with two doses of 5000 U of drug1 to 11 healthy volunteers , resulting in a mean template bleeding time of 6.4 minutes ( 3.2 to 11.4 min ) compared to a mean of 6.0 minutes ( 3.4 to 7.5 min ) for drug2 alone and 5.1 minutes ( 3.5 to 8.5 min ) for placebo . 
Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 , the administration of drug4 to patients taking drug5 should be done extremely cautiously , and patients should be closely monitored . 
drug1 : drug2 IV/IM reduced the drug3 response to drug4 in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20 % ( mean sodium and urinary output decreased 17 % ) . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 ORAL and drug3 resulted in decreased clearance of drug4 and significant increases in drug5 plasma levels ( total AUC increased approximately threefold from 5.4 to 17.8 m g/h/mL ) and terminal half-life increased approximately twofold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours . 
Therefore , concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated . 
drug1 : Inhibition of renal drug2 clearance , leading to an increase in plasma drug3 concentration , has been reported with some prostaglandin synthesis-inhibiting drugs .

Synergism between drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) , drug3 , and other drug4 has been reported . 
This should be considered whenever these agents are prescribed concomitantly . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 , which competes for tubular secretion , has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of drug3 . 
Few systemic data have been collected on the metabolism of drug1 following concomitant administration with other drugs or , alternatively , the effect of concomitant administration of drug2 on the metabolism of other drugs . 
Because drug1 is extensively metabolized , the coadministration of other drugs may affect its clinical activity . 
In vitro studies indicate that drug1 is primarily metabolized to drug2 by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme . 
Therefore , the potential exists for a drug interaction between drug1 and drugs that affect the CYP2B6 isoenzyme ( e.g. , drug2 and drug3 ) . 
The drug1 metabolite of drug2 does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
The effects of concomitant administration of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers . 
Following oral administration of two 150-mg sustained-release tablets with and without 800 mg of drug1 , the pharmacokinetics of drug2 and drug3 were unaffected . 
However , there were 16 % and 32 % increases in the AUC and Cmax , respectively , of the combined moieties of drug1 and drug2 . 
While not systematically studied , certain drugs may induce the metabolism of drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) . 
Animal data indicated that drug1 may be an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans . 
In one study , following chronic administration of drug1 , 100 mg 3 times daily to 8 healthy male volunteers for 14 days , there was no evidence of induction of its own metabolism . 
Nevertheless , there may be the potential for clinically important alterations of blood levels of coadministered drugs . 
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450IID6 ( CYP2D6 ) : Many drugs , including most drug1 ( SSRIs , many drug2 ) , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme . 
Although drug1 is not metabolized by this isoenzyme , drug2 and drug3 are inhibitors of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme in vitro . 
In a study of 15 male subjects ( ages 19 to 35 years ) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme , daily doses of drug1 given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg drug2 increased the Cmax , AUC , and t1/2 of drug3 by an average of approximately 2- , 5- and 2-fold , respectively . 
The effect was present for at least 7 days after the last dose of drug1 . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally studied . 
Therefore , co-administration of drug1 with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) , drug9 ( e.g. , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ) , drug13 ( e.g. , drug14 ) , and drug15 ( e.g. , drug16 , drug17 ) , should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication . 
If drug1 is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6 , the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered , particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index . 
drug1 : Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of drug2 is enhanced by the drug3 drug4 . 
drug1 and drug2 : Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving drug3 concurrently with either drug4 or drug5 . 
Administration of drug1 Tablets to patients receiving either drug2 or drug3 concurrently should be undertaken with caution , using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases . 
Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold : Concurrent administration of drug1 and agents ( e.g. , drug2 , other drug3 , drug4 , systemic drug5 , etc. ) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution . 
Low initial dosing and small gradual dose increases should be employed . 
drug1 Transdermal System : . 
drug1 : In post-marketing experience , there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced drug2 tolerance in patients who were drinking drug3 during treatment with drug4 .

If the usual amounts of nondepolarizing relaxants are given , the time for recovery from neuromuscular blockade will be longer in the presence of drug1 than when drug2 or drug3 with a balanced technique are used . 
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of drug1 reportedly are increased by chronic administration of high doses of drug2 . 
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions , desirable or undesirable , involving drug1 even though drug2 has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs , including other cytotoxic drugs . 
drug1 treatment , which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity , potentiates the effect of drug2 . 
If a patient has been treated with drug1 within 10 days of general anesthesia , the anesthesiologist should be alerted . 
Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when drug1 is administered in combination with other drug2 such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or inhalation general drug6 . 
Postoperative respiratory depression may be enhanced or prolonged by these agents . 
In such cases of combined treatment , the dose of one or both agents should be reduced . 
Limited clinical experience indicates that requirements for drug1 are reduced by 30 to 50 % for the first sixty ( 60 ) minutes following drug2 induction The concomitant use of drug3 with drug4 can significantly inhibit drug5 clearance and may increase the risk of prolonged or delayed respiratory depression . 
drug1 reduces the clearance of drug2 . 
Therefore smaller drug1 doses will be required with prolonged administration and the duration of action of drug2 my be extended . 
Perioperative administration of drugs affecting hepatic blood flow or enzyme function may reduce plasma clearance and prolong recovery . 
drug1 should not be administered concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 .

drug1 administration to three cancer patients over a dose range of 0.025 mg to 2.2 mg led to a dose-dependent inhibition of drug2 elimination.14 The effect of alternate-day administration of 0.25 mg of drug3 on drug metabolism in MS patients is unknown . 
Drug-Drug Interactions drug1 - drug2 should be administered with caution to patients being treated with systemically-administered ( oral or intravenous ) drug3 ( or other drug4 ) because the action of drug5 on the cardiovascular system can be potentiated resulting in increases in heart rate and blood pressure . 
CYP2D6 inhibitors - drug1 is primarily metabolized by the CYP2D6 pathway to drug2 . 
In EMs , selective inhibitors of CYP2D6 increase drug1 steady-state plasma concentrations to exposures similar to those observed in PMs . 
Dosage adjustment of drug1 may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors , e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
In EM individuals treated with drug1 or drug2 , the AUC of drug3 is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css , max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than drug4 alone . 
In vitro studies suggest that coadministration of cytochrome P450 inhibitors to PMs will not increase the plasma concentrations of drug1 . 
Pressor agents - Because of possible effects on blood pressure , drug1 should be used cautiously with pressor agents . 
Caution should be exercised when drug1 are given in conjunction with drug2 . 
Usually , the dosage of the drug1 should be reduced by one-half ( depending on the individual case ) to maintain the prothrombin time at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications . 
Frequent prothrombin determinations are advisable until it has been determined definitely that the prothrombin level has been stabilized . 
drug1 may displace acidic drugs such as drug2 or drug3 from their binding sites . 
Caution should be exercised when treating patients with either of these drugs or other highly protein-bound drugs and drug1 . 
The hypoglycemic effect of drug1 has been reported to increase when drug2 is given concurrently . 
Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another drug1 and drug2 but may be seen after several months . 
For these reasons , it is felt that , in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone , the possible benefits of combined therapy with drug1 and a drug2 do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy , rhabdomyolysis , and acute renal failure . 
While it is not known whether this interaction occurs with drug1 other than drug2 , myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occasionally been associated with the use of drug3 alone , including drug4 . 
Therefore , the combined use of drug1 with drug2 should generally be avoided . 
Drug Interactions : drug1 may interact with some drugs , like drug2 ( drug3 ) : drug4 could theoretically affect drug5 pharmacodynamics - drug6 - Eproxindine - drug7 : drug8 and drug9 cause additive CNS depression - drug10 : drug11 increases the effect of drug12

Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary . 
In clinical studies performed with drug1 , the concomitant use of oral drug2 ( drug3 ) , drug4 ( drug5 ) , drug6 ( drug7 ) , and drug8 did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of drug9 . 
In addition , drug1 neither influenced the pharmacodynamics of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , nor the pharmacokinetics of drug6 at steady state . 
Agents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of drug1 therapy . 
If co-administration is essential , close monitoring may be appropriate . 
In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes , inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of drug1 by drug2 ( 200 m m M i.e. , 350 mg/L ) was 17-28 % . 
Inhibition of the other isozymes evaluated ( CYPs 2A1 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4 , and 3E1 ) was 0-16 % . 
Since drug1 does not markedly inhibit CYP450s ( CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A4 ) in vitro , drug2 is not expected to significantly interact with other drugs in vivo by inhibition of metabolism mediated by these isozymes . 
Since drug1 does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than ATIII , no drug interactions by protein-binding displacement are expected . 
Prospective studies on the potential for drug1 to interact with other drugs have not been performed .

drug1 appears to decrease the rate at which certain drugs are metabolized and therefore may increase the blood levels and the possibility of clinical toxicity of drugs given concomitantly . 
drug1 SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN THOSE PATIENTS REVEIVING drug2 AND ITS CONGENERS . 
SINCE THE CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF THESE TWO DRUGS CAN LEAD TO drug1 INTOXICATION , PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING drug2 TO A PATIENT ON drug3 THERAPY , A BASELINE drug4 SERUM LEVEL SHOULD BE OBTAINED . 
SUBSEQUENT TO INITIATION OF drug1 THERAPY . 
SERUM LEVELS OF drug1 SHOULD BE DETERMINED ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE OR FOR A CONTINUING RISE IN LEVELS .

Testicular atrophy was seen with drug1 administration at doses as low as 30 mg/kg weekly for 6 weeks in rats ( 1/3 the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis ) and as low as 20 mg/kg weekly for 13 weeks in dogs ( approximately equal to the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis ) . 
Persons taking most drug1 , drug2 and drug3 invalidate drug4 and drug5 diagnostic blood assays . 
drug1 drug2 and heavy drug3 intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of drug4 . 
No drugs are known to interfere with the conversion of drug1 to drug2 . 
Conversion could be affected by alterations in the level of phosphatase activity , but given the abundance and wide distribution of phosphatases in the body it is unlikely that drugs would affect this activity enough to affect conversion of drug1 to drug2 . 
Drugs highly bound to albumin could increase the unbound fraction of drug1 . 
Although , it is unknown whether this could result in clinically significant effects , caution is advised when administering drug1 with other drugs that significantly bind to serum albumin . 
The pharmacokinetics and protein binding of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 were not altered when drug4 and drug5 were concurrently administered in single submaximal doses . 
The most significant drug interactions following administration of drug1 are expected to occur with drugs that interact with drug2 . 
drug1 is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement . 
drug1 is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism . 
Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating drug1 concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity . 
drug1 is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes . 
The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below : - Drugs that may increase plasma drug1 concentrations include : acute drug2 intake , drug3 , chboramphenicol , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 
. 
- Drugs that may decrease plasma drug1 concentrations include : drug2 , chronic drug3 abuse , drug4 
. 
- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma drug1 concentrations include : drug2 , vaiproic acid , and drug3 . 
Similarly , the effects of drug1 on drug2 , drug3 and sodium plasma drug4 concentrations are unpredictable 
. 
- Although not a true drug interaction , drug1 may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and drug2 dosage may need to be adjusted 
. 
- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by drug1 include : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , oral drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 . 
Monitoring of plasma drug1 concentrations may be helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 may decrease serum concentrations of 14 . 
It may also produce artifactually low results in dexamethasone or metyrapone tests . 
drug1 may also cause increased serum concentrations of glucose , alkaline phosphatase , and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) . 
Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure plasma drug1 concentrations following drug2 administration . 
drug1 and drug2 Administration of drug3 or drug4 in patients ( n=13 ) and volunteers ( n=96 ) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 ( the active metabolite of drug5 ) concentration . 
Hepatotoxic Drugs Increased side effects may occur when drug1 is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances . 
This is also to be considered when drug1 treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure . 
In a small ( n=30 ) combination study of drug1 with drug2 , a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients . 
All elevations resolved , 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of drug1 . 
A 3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients . 
All of these also resolved , 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of drug1 . 
Three patients met ACR criteria for liver biopsy ( 1 : Roegnik Grade I , 2 : Roegnik Grade IIIa ) . 
No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified . 
drug1 : In in vitro studies , M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50 % in the free fraction of drug2 and drug3 at concentrations in the clinical range . 
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown ; 
however , there was extensive concomitant use of drug1 in clinical studies and no differential effect was observed . 
drug1 : In in vitro studies , M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50 % in the free fraction of drug2 at concentrations in the clinical range . 
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown . 
drug1 : Following concomitant administration of a single dose of drug2 to subjects receiving multiple doses of drug3 , M1 peak levels were increased ( ~40 % ) over those seen when drug4 was given alone . 
Because of the potential for drug1 levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing , caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : Increased INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) when drug2 and drug3 were co-administered has been rarely reported . 
The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by drug1 and drug2 appears to be low for drugs commonly used in chemotherapy or surgery , because drug3 is eliminated by multiple routes . 
Blood levels of drug1 increased 24 % when drug2 was coadministered with drug3 ( nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 ) for 7 days , and decreased 28 % with coadministration of drug4 ( potent inducer of cytochrome P-450 ) for 7 days . 
drug1 has been safely coadministered with drugs used in chemotherapy and surgery . 
As with other agents which prolong ECG intervals , caution should be exercised in patients taking drugs which prolong ECG intervals , particularly QTc . 
In patients taking drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and various chemotherapy agents , no effect was shown on the clearance of drug8 . 
Clearance of drug1 decreased by about 27 % when drug2 was administered intravenously concomitantly with drug3 . 
drug1 does not influence anesthesia recovery time in patients . 
drug1 did not inhibit the antitumor activity of four drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) in four murine models . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drugs that are known to cause pancreatitis may increase the risk of this toxicity ( see WARNINGS ) and should be done with extreme caution , only if other alternatives are not available , and only if clearly indicated . 
Neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with a history of neuropathy or neurotoxic drug therapy , including drug1 , and these patients may be at increased risk of neuropathy during drug2 therapy ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . 
drug1 : The AUC of drug2 was increased about 4-fold when drug3 at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of drug4 to two patients with renal impairment ( CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min ) . 
The effects of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetics in subjects with normal renal function are not known . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 containing drug3 or drug4 with drug5 Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the drug6 components . 
Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach : Drugs such as drug1 and drug2 should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with drug3 . 
drug1 : Administration of drug2 2 hours prior to or concurrent with oral drug3 was associated with a 111 ( 114 ) % increase in the steady-state AUC of drug4 ( n = 12 ) . 
A 21 ( 17 ) % decrease in the steady-state AUC of drug1 was observed when drug2 was administered 2 hours prior to drug3 , but not when the two drugs were administered simultaneously ( n = 12 ) . 
drug1 s : drug2 should be administered at least 2 hours after or 6 hours before dosing with drug3 because plasma concentrations of drug4 are decreased when administered with drug5 containing drug6 , drug7 , or drug8 . 
In eight HIV-infected patients , the steady-state AUC of drug1 was decreased an average of 26 % ( 95 % CI = 14 % , 37 % ) when drug2 was administered 2 hours prior to a marketed chewable/dispersible tablet formulation of drug3 . 
The AUC of drug1 was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given drug2 and drug3 -placebo tablets concurrently . 
In a single subject given one dose of drug1 2 hours after a dose of drug2 -placebo tablets , a greater than 50 % reduction in the AUC of drug3 was observed . 
Plasma concentrations of drug1 are decreased when administered with drug2 containing drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
The optimal dosing interval for coadministration with drug1 should be determined by consulting the appropriate drug2 package insert . 
Interactions with Other drug1 : Significant decreases in the AUC of drug2 ( 20 % ) and drug3 ( 84 % ) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with drug4 . 
To avoid this interaction , drug1 or drug2 should be given 1 hour prior to dosing with drug3 . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 are not altered to a clinically significant degree when it is administered with a light meal 1 hour after drug2 . 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with drug1 . 
drug1 should not be used with other drug2 . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 should not be administered during drug4 treatment . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Increases in lymphocyte counts related to the pharmacologic mechanism of action are frequently observed during drug1 treatment . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 ( another TNF -blocking agent ) and drug2 ( an drug3 ) has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections , and increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone . 
Other drug1 ( including drug2 ) used in combination with drug3 may also result in similar toxicities . 
Specific drug interaction studies , including interactions with drug1 , have not been conducted . 
The majority of patients in rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn s disease clinical studies received one or more concomitant medications . 
In rheumatoid arthritis , concomitant medications besides drug1 were drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and/or drug5 . 
Concomitant Crohn s disease medications were drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 / drug5 and aminosalicylates . 
In psoriatic arthritis clinical trials , concomitant medications included drug1 in approximately half of the patients as well as drug2 , drug3 and drug4 . 
Patients with Crohn s disease who received drug1 tended to experience fewer infusion reactions compared to patients on no drug2 . 
Serum drug1 concentrations appeared to be unaffected by baseline use of medications for the treatment of Crohn s disease including drug2 , drug3 ( drug4 or drug5 ) and aminosalicylates . 
When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with drug1 . 
- drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 : Potentiation of otthostatic hypotension may occur 
. 
- drug1 : ( Oral agents and drug2 ) Dosage adjustment of the drug3 may be required 
. 
- Other drug1 : Additive effect or potentiation 
. 
- drug1 and drug2 drug3 : drug4 and drug5 drug6 have the potential of binding drug7 and reducing drug8 absorption from the gastrointestinal tract 
. 
- drug1 , drug2 : Intensified electrolyte depletion , particularly hypokalemia 
. 
- Pressor amines ( e.g. , drug1 ) : Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use 
. 
- drug1 , nondepolarizing ( e.g. , drug2 ) : Possible increased responsiveness to the drug3 
. 
- drug1 : Generally should not be given with drug2 . 
drug1 reduce the renal clearance of drug2 and add a high risk of drug3 toxicity . 
Refer to the package insert for drug1 preparations before use of such preparations with drug2 
. 
- drug1 : In some patients , the administration of a drug2 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 . 
Therefore , when drug1 and drug2 are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the drug3 is obtained 
. 
- Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : drug1 should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function . 
Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with drug1 ( drug2 ) given with drug3 or drug4 - drug5 combination products . 
For patients receiving drug1 , see CONTRAINDICATIONS . 
drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) and drug5 may reduce the therapeutic effects of drug6 . 
In addition , the beneficial effects of drug1 in Parkinsons disease have been reported to be reversed by drug2 and drug3 . 
Patients taking these drugs with drug1 and drug2 or drug3 - drug4 combination products should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response . 
drug1 salts may reduce the bioavailability of drug2 and drug3 . 
The clinical relevance is unclear . 
Although drug1 may increase the bioavailability of drug2 by increasing gastric emptying , drug3 may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties . 
Drugs that may increase drug1 plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors : drug2 is a CYP3A4 substrate . 
Concomitant use of drug1 and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 ( eg , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ) may increase exposure to drug13 and should be avoided . 
In patients receiving treatment with drug1 , close monitoring for toxicity and a drug2 dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided . 
Drugs that may decrease drug1 plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers : Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease drug2 plasma concentrations . 
In patients in whom CYP3A4 inducers ( eg , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ) are indicated , alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be used . 
If drug1 must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer , a dose increase in drug2 should be considered . 
St. Johns wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) may decrease drug1 plasma concentrations unpredictably . 
Patients receiving drug1 should not take St. Johns wort . 
drug1 : Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of drug2 is pH dependent . 
Simultaneous administration of drug1 with drug2 should be avoided . 
If drug1 therapy is needed , the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of drug2 . 
drug1 / drug2 : Long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by drug3 or drug4 ( eg , drug5 and drug6 ) is likely to reduce drug7 exposure . 
The concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 with drug3 is not recommended . 
The use of drug1 should be considered in place of drug2 or drug3 in patients receiving drug4 therapy . 
Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by drug1 CYP3A4 Substrates : drug2 is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 . 
Therefore , CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , or drug11 ( drug12 , drug13 ) should be administered with caution in patients receiving drug14 . 
Hepatic Impairment There are currently no clinical studies with drug1 in patients with impaired liver function ( clinical studies have excluded patients with ALT and/or AST 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range and/or total bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of the normal range ) . 
Metabolism of drug1 is mainly hepatic . 
Caution is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment . 
Renal Impairment There are currently no clinical studies with drug1 in patients with impaired renal function ( clinical studies have excluded patients with serum creatinine concentration 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range ) . 
drug1 and its metabolites are minimally excreted via the kidney . 
Since the renal excretion of unchanged drug1 and its metabolites is 4 % , a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal insufficiency . 
Drug interaction studies have not been performed with drug1 . 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed . 
No confirmed interactions have been reported between drug1 and other drugs 
drug1 Inhalation Aerosol has been used concomitantly with other drugs , including drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 
With the exception of drug1 , there are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of drug2 Inhalation Aerosol and these drugs with respect to effectiveness . 
drug1 : Although drug2 is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation , there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used drug3 . 
Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of drug1 Inhalation Aerosol with other drug2 -containing drugs . 
Concomitant treatment with drug1 ( eg , rt-PA or drug2 ) may : - increase the risk of bleeding complications - considerably enhance the effect of drug3 on aPTT prolongation 
Concomitant treatment with drug1 ( drug2 ) and drugs that affect platelet function may also increase the risk of bleeding . 
Co-administration of drug1 at steady-state with a single dose of drug2 . 
Co-administration of drug1 at steady-state with a single dose of drug2 ( 2 x 600 mg tablets ) results in increased drug3 serum concentrations . 
Although a dose adjustment of drug1 is not recommended when administered in combination with drug2 , close monitoring for known side effects of drug3 , such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment , is warranted . 
drug1 did not affect the prothrombin time response to a single dose of drug2 . 
However , prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with drug1 and drug2 concomitantly . 
Concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 in clinical practice has been associated with increased anticoagulant effects . 
Drug interaction studies were performed with drug1 and other drugs likely to be co-administered . 
When used in therapeutic doses , drug1 had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ( intravenous and oral ) , drug13 , drug14 / drug15 or drug16 . 
Co-administration with drug1 or drug2 had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
No dosage adjustment of either drug is recommended when drug1 is co administered with any of the above agents . 
Interactions with the drugs listed below have not been reported in clinical trials with drug1 ; 
however , no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction . 
Nonetheless , they have been observed with drug1 . 
Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when drug1 and these drugs are used concomitantly , careful monitoring of patients is advised : drug2 elevated drug3 concentrations . 
drug1 or drug2 acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 concentrations . 
Laboratory Test Interactions There are no reported laboratory test interactions . 
Repeat Treatment Studies evaluating the use of repeated courses of drug1 have not been conducted . 
Oral drug1 : drug2 appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors . 
If oral drug1 are also being given , compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired . 
Patients stabilized on oral drug1 who are found to require drug2 replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started . 
If a patient is truly hypothyroid , it is likely that a reduction in drug1 dosage will be required . 
No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug1 or Oral drug2 : Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in drug3 or oral drug4 requirements . 
The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of drug1 and endocrine status of the patient . 
Patients receiving drug1 or oral drug2 should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug1 : drug2 binds both drug3 and drug4 in the intestine , thus impairing absorption of these drug5 . 
In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed . 
Therefore , 4 to 5 hours should elapse between administration of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 , Oral drug2 : drug3 tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin ( TBg ) . 
In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy , free drug1 may be decreased when drug2 are started thus increasing drug3 requirements . 
However , if the patients thyroid gland has sufficient function , the decreased free drug1 e will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine output by the thyroid . 
Therefore , patients without a functioning drug1 gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if drug2 or drug3 -containing oral drug4 are given . 
drug1 : Use of drug2 with drug3 and other drug4 may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed . 
drug1 activity may also be enhanced . 
drug1 : drug2 may potentiate the toxic effects of drug3 . 
Thyroid hormonal replacement increases metabolic rate , which requires an increase in drug1 dosage . 
drug1 : When administered to patients on a drug2 , this parenteral drug3 may cause hypertension and tachycardia . 
Use with caution and be prepared to treat hypertension , if necessary . 
drug1 s : drug2 increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as drug3 and drug4 . 
Therefore , injection of these agents into patients receiving drug1 increases the risk of precipitating coronary insufficiency especially in patients with coronary artery disease . 
Careful observation is required . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The following drugs or moieties are known to interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on drug1 therapy : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , oral drug5 containing drug6 , drug7 -containing preparations and the numerous preparations containing drug8 . 
- Changes in TBg concentration should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of T4 and T3 values . 
In such cases , the unbound ( free ) hormone should be measured . 
Pregnancy drug1 and drug2 -containing oral drug3 increase TBg concentrations . 
TBg may also be increased during infectious hepatitis . 
Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis , acromegaly and after drug1 or drug2 therapy . 
Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine-binding-globulinemias have been described . 
The incidence of TBg deficiency approximates 1 in 9000 . 
The binding of thyroxine by thyroxine-binding prealbumin ( TBPA ) is inhibited by drug1 
. 
- Medicinal or dietary drug1 interferes with all in vivo tests of radio-iodine uptake producing low uptakes which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone synthesis 
. 
- The persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicates either poor patient compliance , poor absorption , excessive fecal loss , or inactivity of the preparation . 
Intracellular resistance to drug1 is quite rare . 
drug1 injection and drug2 should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias . 
The drugs may , however , be administered alternately provided a proper interval has elapsed between doses . 
drug1 should be used with caution , if at all , when potent inhalational drug2 such as drug3 are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of drug4 . 
Taking drug1 after drinking drug2 may worsen side effects and may cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse . 
In vitro mixing of an drug1 with beta-lactamtype drug2 ( drug3 or drug4 ) may result in a significant mutual inactivation . 
Even when an drug1 and a drug2 -type drug are administered separately by different routes , a reduction in drug3 serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function . 
Usually , such inactivation of the drug1 is clinically significant only in patients with severely impaired renal function . . 
See 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted . 
The effects of drug1 may be potentiated by drug2 which inhibits the metabolism of drug3 . 
The pressor effects of drug1 and other drug2 can combine to cause dangerous hypertension . 
Administration of 0.1-mg/kg ( 2 x ED95 ) drug1 at 10 % or 95 % recovery following an intubating dose of drug2 ( 1 mg/kg ) produced 95 % neuromuscular block . 
The time to onset of maximum block following drug1 is approximately 2 minutes faster with prior administration of drug2 . 
Prior administration of drug1 had no effect on the duration of neuromuscular block following initial or maintenance bolus doses of drug2 . 
Infusion requirements of drug1 in patients administered drug2 prior to infusions of drug3 were comparable to or slightly greater than when drug4 was not administered . 
The use of drug1 before drug2 to attenuate some of the side effects of drug3 has not been studied . 
Although not studied systematically in clinical trials , no drug interactions were observed when drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 were administered following varying degrees of recovery from single doses or infusions of drug4 . 
drug1 or drug2 administered with drug3 / drug4 to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration ] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of drug5 and decrease the required infusion rate of drug6 . 
The magnitude of these effects may depend on the duration of administration of the volatile agents . 
Fifteen to 30 minutes of exposure to 1.25 MAC drug1 or drug2 had minimal effects on the duration of action of initial doses of drug3 and therefore , no adjustment to the initial dose should be necessary when drug4 is administered shortly after initiation of volatile agents . 
In long surgical procedures during drug1 or drug2 anesthesia , less frequent maintenance dosing , lower maintenance doses , or reduced infusion rates of drug3 may be necessary . 
The average infusion rate requirement may be decreased by as much as 30 % to 40 % . 
In clinical studies drug1 had no effect on the duration of action or dosing requirements for drug2 . 
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of drug1 such as drug2 include certain drug3 ( e. g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 ) , drug12 salts , drug13 , local drug14 , drug15 , and drug16 . 
Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of drug1 has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered drug2 or drug3 . 
While the effects of chronic drug1 or drug2 therapy on the action of drug3 are unknown , slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None known . 
In clinical studies , drug1 has been co-administered with other anti-asthma medications , including inhaled and oral drug2 , and inhaled drug3 , with no evidence of increased frequency of adverse events or laboratory abnormalities . 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies , however , have been conducted . 
drug1 can interact with drug2 or other drug3 ( may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or drug4 ) , drug5 or other medications with anticholinergic activity ( anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with drug6 ) , and drug7 ( concurrent use with drug8 may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of drug9 ) . 
drug1 such as drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 ) , drug4 ( e.g. , drug5 ) , drug6 ( e.g. , drug7 ) , drug8 ( e.g. , drug9 ) , and drug10 ( e.g. , drug11 ) : Using these medicines with drug12 may increase the chance of side effects . 
Addition or deletion of any drug from the therapeutic regimen of patients receiving oral drug1 may affect patient response to the drug2 . 
Frequent determination of prothrombin time and close monitoring of the patient is essential to ascertain when adjustment of dosage of drug1 may be needed . 
Because of the variability of individual patient response , multiple interacting mechanisms with some drugs , the dependency of the extent of the interaction on the dosage and duration of therapy , and the possible administration of several interacting drugs simultaneously , it is difficult to predict the direction and degree of the ultimate effect of concomitant medications on drug1 response . 
For example , since drug1 may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of both the oral drug2 and drug3 , the net effects are unpredictable . 
drug1 may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the drug2 from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction , thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect . 
An interacting drug which leads to a decrease in prothrombin time necessitating an increased dose of oral drug1 to maintain an adequate degree of anticoagulation may , if abruptly discontinued , increase the risk of subsequent bleeding .

Oral drug1 may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of drug2 , eg , drug3 and drug4 , by inhibiting their metabolism in the liver . 
Because oral drug1 may interfere with the hepatic metabolism of drug2 , toxic levels of the drug3 may occur when an oral drug4 and drug5 are administered concurrently . 
Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression ( such as drug1 ) or drugs which inhibit platelet function ( eg , drug2 and other drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 ) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by drug8 without altering prothrombin time determinations . 
The beneficial effects on arterial thrombus formation from combined therapy with drug1 and drug2 must be weighed against an increased risk of inducing hemorrhage . 
* Increased and decreased prothrombin time responses have been reported . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interferences : drug1 and drug2 , including drug3 , or their metabolites may color alkaline urine red-orange , which may interfere with spectrophotometrically determined urinary laboratory tests . 
The color reverses when the test sample is acidified in vitro to a pH below 4 . 
drug1 preparations are incompatible with drug2 preparations . 
drug1 - Concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 may enhance nutrient absorption in those with severe short bowel syndrome . 
drug1 has orphan drug status for this indication . 
drug1 - Concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by drug4 . 
The reported dose used for drug1 was 21 grams daily taken in divided doses three times a day . 
Further , drug1 is reported to have a synergistic effect with this combination in ameliorating intestinal permeability . 
drug1 - There is one report that drug2 may decrease the possible effectiveness of supplemental drug3 for chemotherapy-induced mucositis . 
In another report , nine patients with breast cancer were reported to have decreased symptoms of drug1 -related toxicity when given supplemental drug2 at a dose of 0.5 gram/kilogram/day . 
drug1 - In one report , drug2 at a dose of 10 grams three times daily , given 24 hours after receiving drug3 , appeared to prevent the development of myalgia and arthralgia , adverse reactions of drug4 . 
In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male ( n=12 in each study ) a nd female ( n=12 in each study ) volunteers , drug1 7.5 mg ( 1.5 times the daily dose ) once daily was coadministered with drug2 500 mg every 8 hours or drug3 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days . 
In three separate controlled , parallel group clinical pharmacology studies , drug1 at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with drug2 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days ( n=18 ) or with drug3 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23 day pretreatment period with drug4 ( n=18 ) or with drug5 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days ( n=18 ) under steady state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers . 
Although increased plasma concentrations ( C max and AUC 0-24 hrs ) of drug1 and drug2 were observed , there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of drug3 , as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters ( including the corrected QT interval ) , clinical laboratory tests , vital signs , and adverse events .

No specific pharmacokinetic or other formal drug interaction studies were conducted . 
drug1 : Supraventricular arrhythmias may mask the cardiotoxicity associated with excessive drug2 levels . 
Therefore , it is advisable to be particularly cautious in patients whose plasma drug1 levels are above or suspected to be above the usual therapeutic range . 
Coadministration of drug1 did not have effects on either the safety or efficacy of drug2 in the clinical trials . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 did not have any effect on either the safety or efficacy of drug3 in the clinical trials . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 did not have any effect on either the safety or efficacy of drug3 in the clinical trials . 
Use of drug1 in a patient who has previously received drug2 increases the risk of cardiotoxicity . 
drug1 should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of drug2 or drug3 . 
drug1 used concurrently with drug2 may also result in increased cardiotoxicity . 
Dosage reduction of drug1 may be required when used concurrently with other myelosuppressive agents . 
Hepatotoxic medications , such as high-dose drug1 , may impair liver function and increase the risk of toxicity . 
drug1 is metabolized by CYP 3A4 in vitro . 
Clinical studies of the effect of strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of drug1 have not been performed . 
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenesis study was conducted in female and male rats , at intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg/30 days , 10 mg/rat/30 days and 10 mg/rat/15 days . 
These doses correspond to approximately 1- , 3- , and 5-fold ( in females ) and 1.3- , 1.3- , and 1.6-fold ( in males ) the systemic exposure [AUC0-30 days ] ] achieved in women receiving the recommended dose of 250 mg/month . 
An increased incidence of benign ovarian granulosa cell tumors and testicular Leydig cell tumors was evident , in females dosed at 10 mg/rat/15 days and males dosed at 15 mg/rat/30 days , respectively . 
Induction of such tumors is consistent with the pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by an drug1 . 
drug1 was not mutagenic or clastogenic in multiple in vitro tests with and without the addition of a mammalian liver metabolic activation factor ( bacterial mutation assay in strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , in vitro cytogenetics study in human lymphocytes , mammalian cell mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and in vivo micronucleus test in rat . 
In female rats , drug1 administered at doses 0.01 mg/kg/day ( approximately one-hundredth of the human recommended dose based on body surface area [BSA ] , for 2 weeks prior to and for 1 week following mating , caused a reduction in fertility and embryonic survival . 
No adverse effects on female fertility and embryonic survival were evident in female animals dosed at 0.001 mg/kg/day ( approximately one-thousandth of the human dose based on BSA ) . 
Restoration of female fertility to values similar to controls was evident following a 29-day withdrawal period after dosing at 2 mg/kg/day ( twice the human dose based on BSA ) . 
The effects of drug1 on the fertility of female rats appear to be consistent with its anti-estrogenic activity . 
The potential effects of drug1 on the fertility of male animals were not studied but in a 6-month toxicology study , male rats treated with intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg/30 days , 10 mg/rat/30 days , or 10 mg/rat/15 days drug2 showed a loss of spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules , seminiferous tubular atrophy , and degenerative changes in the epididymides . 
Changes in the testes and epididymides had not recovered 20 weeks after cessation of dosing . 
These drug1 doses correspond to approximately 2- , 3- , and 3-fold the systemic exposure [AUC0-30 days ] achieved in women . 
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D : . 
In studies in female rats at doses 0.01 mg/kg/day ( IM ; 
approximately one-hundredth of the human recommended dose based on body surface area [BSA ] ) , drug1 caused a reversible reduction in female fertility , as well as effects on embryo/fetal development consistent with its anti-estrogenic activity . 
drug1 caused an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities in rats ( tarsal flexure of the hind paw at 2 mg/kg/day IM ; 
twice the human dose on BSA ) and non-ossification of the odontoid and ventral tubercle of the first cervical vertebra at doses 0.1 mg/kg/day IM ( approximately one-tenth of the human dose on BSA ) when administered during the period of organogenesis . 
Rabbits failed to maintain pregnancy when dosed with 1 mg/kg/day drug1 IM ( twice the human dose on BSA ) during the period of organogenesis . 
Further , in rabbits dosed at 0.25 mg/kg/day ( about one-half the human dose on BSA ) , increases in placental weight and post-implantation loss were observed but , there were no observed effects on fetal development . 
drug1 was associated with an increased incidence of fetal variations in rabbits ( backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle , and 27 pre-sacral vertebrae at 0.25 mg/kg/day IM ; 
one-half the human dose on BSA ) when administered during the period of organogenesis . 
Because pregnancy could not be maintained in the rabbit following doses of drug1 of 1 mg/kg/day and above , this study was inadequate to fully define the possible adverse effects on fetal development at clinically relevant exposures . 
Nursing Mothers drug1 is found in rat milk at levels significantly higher ( approximately 12-fold ) than plasma after administration of 2 mg/kg . 
Drug exposure in rodent pups from drug1 -treated lactating dams was estimated as 10 % of the administered dose . 
It is not known if drug1 is excreted in human milk . 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from drug1 in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother . 
Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of drug1 in pediatric patients have not been established . 
Geriatric Use When tumor response was considered by age , objective responses were seen in 24 % and 22 % of patients under 65 years of age and in 16 % and 11 % of patients 65 years of age and older , who were treated with drug1 in the European and North American trials , respectively . 
drug1 is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion . 
The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered , particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system ( e.g. , drug1 ) . 
No change in dose of either drug is recommended . 
There is no information regarding the effect on drug1 pharmacokinetics of higher doses of drug2 / drug3 such as those used to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . 
No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of drug1 . 
drug1 and drug2 may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another . 
Therefore , use of drug1 in combination with drug2 is not recommended 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
drug1 decreases drug2 clearance by up to 25 % , and may produce AUCs 1500 M min in some patients . 
drug1 , and the drug2 drug3 ( drug4 ) and drug5 ( drug6 ) have all been used with drug7 . 
drug1 increases the clearance of drug2 by 15 % or more , possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase . 
Since the pharmacokinetics of drug1 were studied in patients treated with drug2 , the clearance of drug3 at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure ( AUC ) higher in patients not treated with drug4 . 
Because drug1 is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione , use of drug2 prior to ( 72 hours ) or concurrent with drug3 may result in reduced drug4 clearance based upon the known property of drug5 to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues . 
Catecholamine-depleting drugs ( eg , drug1 ) may have an additive effect when given with drug2 s . 
Patients treated with drug1 plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
drug1 may also have an additive effect when given with drug2 . 
drug1 may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of drug2 . 
If the two drugs are coadministered , the drug1 should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of drug2 . 
If replacing drug1 by drug2 therapy , the introduction of drug3 should be delayed for several days after drug4 administration has stopped . 
Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs , eg , drug1 , may decrease the hypotensive effects of drug2 . 
Information on concurrent usage of drug1 and drug2 is limited . 
Data from several studies , ie , TIMI-II , ISIS-2 , currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between drug1 and drug2 in the acute myocardial infarction setting . 
While taking drug1 , patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic or therapeutic . 
Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of drug1 used to treat the allergic reaction . 
drug1 augments the action of drug2 s and the muscle relaxant effects of drug3 . 
drug1 may augment the hypotension caused by the ganglionic-blocking effect of drug2 . 
Caution should be exercised during the administration of drug1 to patients anaesthetised with drug2 as arrhythmias may be precipitated . 
For this reason the dose of drug1 should be restricted and an drug2 administered as appropriate . 
Caution should also be applied for other drug1 , and for drug2 and drug3 and drug4 , which may also precipitate arrhythmias . 
Limited PK and/or PD studies investigating possible interactions between drug1 and other medicinal products have been conducted . 
In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that drug1 and drug2 do not affect the PK properties of drug3 , nor does drug4 affect the PK properties of drug5 or drug6 . 
Although additional drug interaction studies have not been conducted , the most common medications used concomitantly with drug1 in clinical trials were drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
There is no clinical evidence to suggest that drug1 interacts with any of these compounds . 
An in vivo interaction study in humans demonstrated that a single 1mg dose of drug1 administered concomitantly with a single 900 mg dose of drug2 was generally well tolerated . 
There was no effect on bleeding time , PT or aPTT . 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between drug1 and drug2 were observed . 
In that same study , drug1 alone produced a marked inhibition in platelet aggregation ex vivo . 
drug1 alone had no effect on platelet aggregation , but did slightly enhance the inhibition of platelet aggregation by drug2 . 
drug1 is metabolized at least in part by CYP1A2 . 
It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products , including drug1 , and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of drug2 . 
drug1 demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. 
drug1 demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. drug2 . 
drug1 is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP PDE III . 
The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 may be exacerbated by drug6 . 
There is a single case report , which suggests that drug1 may interfere with drug2 absorption . 
Food has no clinically significant effect on the bioavailability of drug1 . 
Potential for Interaction with drug1 
In patients receiving another drug1 in combination with drug2 ( drug3 ) , there have been reports of serious , sometimes fatal , reactions including hyperthermia , rigidity , myoclonus , autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs , and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma . 
These reactions have also been reported in patients who have discontinued that drug and have been started on a drug1 . 
Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome . 
Therefore , it is recommended that drug1 Tablets not be used in combination with drug2 , or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a drug3 . 
After stopping drug1 Tablets , at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a drug2 . 
Potential drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 Interactions 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme , and it has been demonstrated that drug4 , a potent inhibitor of IIIA4 , blocks the metabolism of these drugs , resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug . 
Increased plasma concentrations of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 cause QT prolongation and have been associated with torsades de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia , sometimes fatal . 
As noted below , a sub- for drug1 in combination with drug2 , a drug that is known to be metabolized by the IIIA4 isozyme . 
Although it has not been definitively demonstrated that drug1 is a potent IIIA4 inhibitor , it is likely to be , given the substantial interaction of drug2 with drug3 . 
Consequently , it is recommended that drug1 not be used in combination with either drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions : drug1 : drug2 metabolized by hepatic oxidation ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 elc. ) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by drug6 . 
The clearance of drug1 metabolized by glucuronidation ( e. g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) is unlikely to be affected by drug5 . 
drug1 : When drug2 ( 100 mg qd ) and drug3 ( 1 mg q.d. were co-administered to steady state , plasma concentration and other pharmacokinetics parameters ( AUC , Cmax , T1/2 , ) of drug4 were approximately twice those observed when drug5 was administered alone ; 
oral clearance was reduced by about 50 % . 
The elevated plasma drug1 concentrations resulted in decreased psychomotor performance and memory . 
This interaction , which has not been investigated using higher doses of drug1 , may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered , particularly since drug2 exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If drug3 is co-administered with drug4 Tablets , the initial drug5 dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended . 
No dosage adjustment is required for drug1 Tablets . 
drug1 : The co-administration of drug2 Tablets and drug3 is generally not advisable . 
Because drug1 reduces the clearance of both drug2 and its active metabolite , drug3 , there is a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic co-administration . 
Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer drug1 and drug2 is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of drug3 were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of drug4 . 
In these subjects ( R= B ) , the clearance of drug1 was reduced by 65 % and that of drug2 to a level that was too low to measure over the course of the 2 week long study . 
It is likely that experience significantly underestimates the degree of accumulation that might occur with repealed drug1 administration . 
Moreover , as noted with drug1 , the effect of drug2 may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses . 
Accordingly , drug1 and drug2 should not ordinarily be co-administered . 
drug1 : The effect of steady-state drug2 l50 mg bid on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug3 ( 375 mg ) as 442 mg drug4 was evaluated in 12 healthy non-smoking , male volunteers . 
The clearance of drug1 was decreased approximately 3-fold . 
Therefore , if drug1 is co-administered with drug2 , its dose should be reduced to one third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentrations of drug3 should to monitored . 
No dosage adjustment is required for drug1 Tablets . 
drug1 : When drug2 ( 50 mg tid ) was administered concomitantly with drug3 for two weeks , drug4 plasma concentrations increased by 98 % and prothrombin times were prolonged . 
Thus patients receiving oral drug1 and drug2 Tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their drug3 dose adjusted accordingly . 
No dosage adjustment is required for drug1 Tablets . 
In occasional susceptible patients or in those receiving drug1 ( including antiparkinsonism agents ) in addition , the atropine-like effects may become more pronounced ( e.g. , paralytic ileus ) . 
Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage is required when this drug is administered concomitantly with drug1 . 
Avoid the use of preparations such as drug1 and local drug2 which contain any drug3 ( e.g. , drug4 , drug5 ) , since it has been reported that drug6 can potentiate the effects of catecholamines . 
Caution should be exercised when drug1 is used with agents that lower blood pressure . 
drug1 may potentiate the effects of drug2 . 
The plasma concentration of drug1 may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 ) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers ( e.g. , drug4 , drug5 ) , and adjustment of the dosage of drug6 may therefore be necessary . 
Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 ( debrisoquin hydroxylase ) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population ( about 7 to 10 % of caucasians are so called poor metabolizers ) ; 
reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian , African and other populations are not yet available . 
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of drug1 ( drug2 ) when given usual doses . 
Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large ( 8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the drug1 ) . 
In addition , certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble p.o. 
metabolizers . 
An individual who is stable on a given dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy . 
The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme ( drug1 ; 
drug1 ) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 ( many other drug2 , drug3 , and the drug4 drug5 and drug6 ) . 
While all the drug1 ( drug2 ) , e. g. , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , inhibit P450 2D6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
The extent to which drug1 - drug2 interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition , and the pharmacokinetics of the drug3 involved . 
Nevertheless , caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCA5 with any of the drug1 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
Of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from drug1 , given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite ( at least 5 weeks may be necessary ) . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug2 or the other drug . 
Furthermore , whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from cotherapy , an increased dose of drug1 may be required . 
It is desirable to monitor drug1 plasma levels whenever a drug2 is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 . 
drug1 , drug2 , Metal Cations , drug3 drug4 form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations . 
Administration of drug1 with drug2 containing drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 , with drug6 , with metal cations such as drug7 , or with drug8 containing drug9 or drug10 , or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as drug11 ( drug12 ) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution , may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug13 , resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired . 
These agents should not be taken within 4 hours before or 4 hours after drug1 administration . 
drug1 drug2 drug3 , like other drug4 , may inhibit the metabolism of drug5 and drug6 . 
These stimulants are commonly found in coffee and tea , respectively . 
In some patients , this may lead to reduced clearance , prolongation of plasma half-life , and enhanced effects of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 : drug2 is a competitive inhibitor of the metabolism of drug3 . 
Serum drug1 concentrations increase when drug2 is initiated in a patient maintained on drug3 . 
When initiating a multi-day course of drug1 in a patient maintained on drug2 , the drug3 maintenance dose should be halved for the period of concurrent use of drug4 and monitoring of serum drug5 concentrations should be initiated as a guide to further dosage adjustments . 
drug1 : In subjects receiving drug2 , no significant change in clotting time was observed when drug3 was coadministered . 
However , because some drug1 have been reported to enhance the effects of drug2 or its derivatives , prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a drug3 is administered with drug4 or its derivatives . 
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of drug1 on drug2 indicates that drug3 inhibits drug4 metabolism , which is mediated by CYP1A2 . 
While no clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of drug1 on the metabolism of C.P.A. 
substrates , in vitro data suggest similar effects of drug1 in CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and drug2 metabolism . 
In addition , other drug1 have been reported to decrease the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of drug2 . 
Other drugs metabolized by C.P.A. 
include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
The clinical relevance of the potential effect of drug1 on the metabolism of C.P.A. substrates is not known . 
Patients receiving concurrent administration of substrates of C.P.A. were not excluded from clinical trials of drug1 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : The concomitant administration of a drug3 with a drug4 may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions . 
drug1 : Disturbances of blood glucose , including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia , have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with drug2 and an drug3 . 
Therefore , careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are coadministered . 
The absorption of drug1 may be affected by the simultaneous administration of indigestion remedies , drug2 or drug3 supplements . 
Oral drug1 may be less effective while you are taking drug2 . 
Potential drug interactions between drug1 ( drug2 cream ) Cream , 1 % , and other drugs have not been systematically evaluated . 
drug1 : drug2 ( drug3 ) has been safely coadministered with drug4 . 
drug1 : A study in normal healthy volunteers has shown that concomitant administration of drug2 ( drug3 ) and drug4 does not result in altered pharmacoktnetics of either drug . 
In a study in hypertensive patients , addition of drug1 to existing drug2 therapy did not result in any unexpected adverse effects , and drug3 had an additional antihypertensive effect . 
drug1 : In a single dose study in normal volunteers , coadministration of drug2 had a small effect on the rate but no effect on the extent of drug3 bioavailability . 
Significant increases In AUC ( 27 % ) and Cmax ( 58 % ) and decreases in tmax ( 23 % ) of drug1 were noted in this study . 
However , concomitant administration of 5 mg b.i.d. drug1 and 40 mg b.i.d. 
drug1 to healthy volunteers under steady-state conditions had no relevant effect on either drug s bioavailability , AUC and Cmax , differences were 20 % between drug2 given singly and in combination with drug3 , and between drug4 given singly and in combination with drug5 . 
drug1 : In a study in healthy volunteers , a one-week course of drug2 at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of drug3 on the sixth day showed an increase in drug4 mean peak plasma concentrations ( 36 % ) and significant increase in area under the curve ( 50 % ) . 
If drug1 therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving drug2 careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required . 
drug1 : In a study in healthy volunteers , a six-day course of drug2 at 600 mg/day followed by a single 5 mg dose of drug3 resulted in a reduction in drug4 levels to below detectable limits . 
If drug1 therapy is required , drug2 concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 : In a study in healthy volunteers , no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between drug2 and racemic drug3 was seen when two single oral doses of drug4 ( 0.7 mg/kg body weight ) were administered during 11 days of multipledose treatment with 5 mg b.i.d. drug5 . 
Neither racemic drug1 nor drug2 binding to plasma proteins in vitro was altered by the addition of the other drug . 
drug1 : The concomitant administration of drug2 ( drug3 ) and drug4 in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study did not affect renal , nonrenal and total body clearance of drug5 . 
drug1 Anesthesia : Severe hypotension has been reported during drug2 anesthesia with concomitant use of a drug3 and a drug4 . 
Even though such interactions have not been seen in clinical studies with drug1 ( drug2 ) , an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur . 
In normal volunteers receiving drug1 , the administration of drug2 decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of drug3 . 
In some patients , combined use of drug1 and drug2 has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage . 
Therefore , drug1 and drug2 should not be used concomitantly . 
In a study in normal volunteers , it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of drug1 per day decreases drug2 blood levels approximately 20 % . 
The concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity , with little or no increase in efficacy . 
Clinical studies have shown that drug1 does not influence the hypoprothrombinemia produced by drug2 . 
However , when any additional drug , including drug1 , is added to the treatment of patients on drug2 therapy , the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time . 
In post-marketing experience , bleeding has been reported in patients on concomitant treatment with drug1 and drug2 . 
Caution should be exercised when drug1 and drug2 are administered concomitantly . 
When drug1 is given to patients receiving drug2 , the plasma levels of drug3 are likely to be increased . 
Therefore , a lower total daily dosage of drug1 may produce a satisfactory therapeutic effect . 
When increases in the dose of drug1 are made , they should be made carefully and in small increments . 
Caution should be used if drug1 is administered simultaneously with drug2 . 
drug1 has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of drug2 and to potentiate its toxicity . 
Administration of drug1 concomitantly with drug2 has been associated with an increase in drug3 -induced toxicity , possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin . 
drug1 should be used with caution in patients taking drug2 , and renal function should be carefully monitored . 
Capsules drug1 50 mg t.i.d. produced a clinically relevant elevation of plasma drug2 and reduction in renal drug3 clearance in psychiatric patients and normal subjects with steady state plasma drug4 concentrations . 
This effect has been attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis . 
As a consequence , when drug1 and drug2 are given concomitantly , the patient should be carefully observed for signs of drug3 toxicity . 
( Read circulars for drug1 preparations before use of such concomitant therapy . ) 
In addition , the frequency of monitoring serum drug1 concentration should be increased at the outset of such combination drug treatment . 
drug1 given concomitantly with drug2 has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of drug3 . 
Therefore , when drug1 and drug2 are used concomitantly , serum drug3 levels should be closely monitored . 
In some patients , the administration of drug1 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
Therefore , when drug1 and drug2 . 
( drug1 ) drug2 are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the drug3 is obtained . 
drug1 reduces basal plasma renin activity ( PRA ) , as well as those elevations of PRA induced by drug2 administration , or salt or volume depletion . 
These facts should be considered when evaluating plasma renin activity in hypertensive patients . 
It has been reported that the addition of drug1 to a maintenance schedule of drug2 resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers . 
drug1 and drug2 should not be administered together . 
drug1 and drug2 each may be associated with increased serum potassium levels . 
The potential effects of drug1 and drug2 on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently . 
Most of the above effects concerning drug1 have been attributed , at least in part , to mechanisms involving inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by drug2 . 
Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of drug1 by drug2 including drug3 has been reported . 
Therefore , when using these blocking agents to treat hypertension , patients should be observed carefully in order to confirm that the desired therapeutic effect has been obtained . 
drug1 can reduce the antihypertensive effects of drug2 and drug3 . 
False-negative results in the dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) in patients being treated with drug1 have been reported . 
Thus , results of the DST should be interpreted with caution in these patients . 
Patients on drug1 therapy may require dosage adjustment of the anticoagulant during and after drug2 therapy . 
Concomitant use of drug1 usually depresses drug2 activity and may necessitate raising the dosage . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 has been reported to reduce the efficacy of oral drug2 and to increase the incidence of breakthrough bleeding . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 -containing drug3 has not been formally studied . 
Although drug1 has a lower affinity for drug2 than for drug3 , drug4 should not be taken with drug5 -containing drug6 . 
In healthy volunteers , drug1 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
The effect of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetics has not been studied . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 has not been formally studied . 
Doses of drug1 up to 200 mg were allowed in clinical studies without negative consequences . 
The interaction of drug1 with drug2 has not been formally studied . 
No inhibition of drug1 metabolism by drug2 is expected based on the results of an in vitro study . 
drug1 should not be combined with other iron chelator therapies , as safety of such combinations has not been established . 
Drug/Food Interactions The bioavailability ( AUC ) of drug1 was variably increased when taken with a meal . 
drug1 should be taken on an empty stomach 30 minutes before eating . 
drug1 tablets for oral suspension can be dispersed in water , orange juice , or apple juice . 
The use of drug1 in patients who are receiving drug2 may potentiate renal disease states . 
In vitro studies have shown that drug1 anion , because of its affinity for protein , may displace from their binding sites other drugs which are also albumin-bound . 
Theoretically , the drug1 anion itself could likewise be displaced . 
Short-term controlled studies failed to show that taking the drug significantly affects prothrombin times when administered to individuals on drug1 . 
Caution is advised nonetheless , since interactions have been seen with other nonsteroidal agents of this class . 
Similarly , patients receiving the drug and a drug1 , drug2 or drug3 should be observed for signs of toxicity to these drugs . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 is not recommended because drug3 is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of drug4 , resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels . 
The natriuretic effect of drug1 has been reported to be inhibited by some drugs of this class . 
Inhibition of renal drug1 clearance leading to increases in plasma drug2 concentrations has also been reported . 
drug1 and other drug2 can reduce the antihypertensive effect of drug3 and other drug4 . 
drug1 given concurrently increases drug2 anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly . 
Caution should be used if drug1 is administered concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 , drug2 and other drug3 have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of drug4 in an animal model , possibly increasing the toxicity of drug5 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time . 
This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined . 
The administration of drug1 may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-dinitrobenzene used in this assay . 
Although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements ( Porter-Silber test ) do not appear to be artifactually altered , it is suggested that therapy with drug1 be temporarily discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the Porter-Silber test is to be used . 
drug1 may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid ( 5HIAA ) . 
The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an drug1 ( eg , drug2 ) , an drug3 ( eg , drug4 ) , and/or a drug5 ( eg , drug6 ) --commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects , including dry mouth and associated dental complications , blurred vision , and , in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity , hyperpyrexia . 
Interactions may also occur with the following : drug1 / drug2 , drugs used to treat an overactive thyroid , drug3 ( e.g. , drug4 ) , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 pain medication ( e.g. , drug13 ) , drugs used to aid sleep , drowsiness-causing drug14 ( e.g. , drug15 ) , any other drugs that may make you drowsy . 
Drug Interactions . 
drug1 has been administered to patients receiving drug2 or drug3 without adverse effects . 
During administration of multiple oral doses of drug1 to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of drug2 , a 13 % -19 % increase in plasma drug3 levels occurred at six hours postdose . 
In a study involving healthy subjects receiving drug1 and drug2 concurrently , plasma drug3 levels were increased about 20 % and drug4 levels were increased about 30 % compared to control values . 
In this formal interaction study , drug1 and drug2 were each found to have negative inotropic effects ; 
when the drugs were administered together , the effects were additive . 
The effects of concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 on the PR interval were less than additive . 
In drug1 clinical trials , patients who were receiving drug2 concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects . 
Nevertheless , the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of drug1 and drug2 should be recognized . 
drug1 is not extensively bound to plasma proteins . 
In vitro studies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of drug1 binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less . 
Consequently , interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound ( e.g. , drug1 ) would not be expected . 
drug1 has been used in a large number of patients receiving drug2 without apparent interaction . 
Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( drug1 , drug2 , drug3 ) indicate only a 30 % increase in the rate of drug4 elimination . 
In healthy subjects receiving drug1 ( 1 gm daily ) for one week , plasma drug2 levels increased by about 30 % and half-life increased by about 10 % . 
When drug1 is added to drug2 therapy , plasma drug3 levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients , if drug4 dosage is not reduced . 
Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6 , such as drug1 , might increase the plasma concentrations of drug2 in patients that are on chronic drug3 therapy ; 
especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers . 
There has been little experience with the coadministration of drug1 and either drug2 or drug3 . 
Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with drug1 are unknown , neither drug2 nor drug3 should be administered concurrently with drug4 unless , in the judgment of the physician , the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks . 
There has been too little experience with the coadministration of drug1 with drug2 or drug3 to recommend concomitant use . 
drug1 : The effect of an drug2 - and drug3 -containing drug4 ( drug5 ) * on the pharmacokinetics of drug6 was investigated in 12 cancer patients . 
There was a small increase in plasma concentrations of drug1 and one metabolite ( drug2 ) ; 
there was no effect on the 3 major metabolites ( drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ) . 
drug1 Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking drug2 concomitantly with drug3 such as drug4 and drug5 . 
Patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters ( PT or INR ) . 
drug1 : The concentration of drug2 is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by drug3 . 
Deaths from severe enterocolitis , diarrhea , and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly drug1 and drug2 . 
Cytochrome P450 1A2 ( CYP1A2 ) is known to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of drug1 . 
Therefore , drug1 has the potential to interact with drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2 , inhibit CYP1A2 , or induce CYP1A2 . 
Few data exist on drug interactions with drug1 in preterm neonates . 
Based on adult data , lower doses of drug1 may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease drug2 elimination ( e.g. , drug3 and drug4 ) and higher drug5 doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase drug6 elimination ( e.g. , drug7 and drug8 ) . 
drug1 administered concurrently with drug2 reduced the urine volume in 4 healthy volunteers . 
The clinical significance of this interaction in preterm neonates is not known . 
Interconversion between drug1 and drug2 has been reported in preterm neonates . 
The concurrent use of these drugs is not recommended . 
No drug interaction studies have been performed . 
Other medicines - Although certain medicines should not be used together at all , in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur . 
In these cases , your doctor may want to change the dose , or other precautions may be necessary . 
When you are using drug1 , it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following : Eye product containing drug2 . 
drug1 may interact with the drug2 preparation causing a gritty substance to form or may interact with the preservative in the drug3 preparation causing a toxic effect in the eye . 
No well-known drug interactions with drug1 
Clinical trials have indicated that drug1 can be effectively and safely used in conjunction with standard cystic fibrosis therapies including oral , inhaled and/or parenteral drug2 , drug3 , enzyme supplements , drug4 , oral or inhaled drug5 , and drug6 . 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed . 
Clinically meaningful drug interactions have occurred with concomitant medications and include , but are not limited to the following : Agents Highly Bound to Plasma Protein drug1 is not highly bound to plasma proteins ; 
therefore , administration of drug1 to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound should not cause increased free concentrations of the other drug . 
Agents that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes and/or Epoxide Hydrolase drug1 is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 to the active drug2 , which is further metabolized to the trans-diol by epoxide hydrolase . 
Therefore , the potential exists for interaction between drug1 and any agent that inhibits CYP3A4 and/or epoxide hydrolase . 
Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found , or are expected , to increase plasma levels of drug1 are the following : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ( 1 ) , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 ( 1 ) , drug11 , drug12 , grapefruit juice , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 , drug23 , drug24 , drug25 ( 1 ) , drug26 , drug27 . 
Thus , if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of drug1 , and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors , it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for drug2 may be necessary . 
Agents that Induce Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes drug1 is metabolized by CYP3A4 . 
Therefore , the potential exists for interaction between drug1 and any agent that induces CYP3A4 . 
Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found , or are expected , to decrease plasma levels of drug1 are the following : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 ( 2 ) , drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 Thus , if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on drug11 , and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers , it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for drug12 may be necessary . 
Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of drug1 due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes drug2 is known to induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 . 
Therefore , the potential exists for interaction between drug1 and any agent metabolized by one ( or more ) of these enzymes . 
Agents that have been found , or are expected to have decreased plasma levels in the presence of drug1 due to induction of CYP enzymes are the following : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 , drug23 , drug24 , drug25 , drug26 , drug27 , drug28 , drug29 , drug30 , oral drug31 ( 3 ) , drug32 , drug33 ( 4 ) , drug34 , drug35 , drug36 , drug37 , drug38 , drug39 , drug40 , drug41 , drug42 , drug43 , drug44 ( 5 ) , drug45 , and drug46 . 
Thus , if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category , and then begins a course of treatment with drug1 , it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary . 
Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of drug1 : drug2 increases the plasma levels of the following agents : drug3 , drug4 ( 6 ) , and drug5 Thus , if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category , and then begins a course of the treatment with drug6 , it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary . 
Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with drug1 Concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects . 
Given the anticonvulsant properties of drug1 , drug2 may reduce the thyroid function as has been reported with other drug3 . 
Additionally , drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , may antagonize the activity of drug4 . 
Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category , and then begins a course of treatment with drug1 , it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary . 
Because of its primary CNS effect , caution should be used when drug1 is taken with other drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 - drug2 may counteract the antinaturetic effect of drug3 . 
drug1 - drug2 may increase the absorption of drug3 if taken concomitantly . 
Organic drug1 - drug2 supplements theoretically may potentiate the effects of organic drug3 if taken concomitantly . 
drug1 - Theoretically , drug2 supplements taken concomitantly with drug3 , may potentiate the effects of the drug . 
drug1 may decrease drug2 response to drug3 . 
drug1 is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4 . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug , which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects . 
drug1 is metabolized by CYP3A4 . 
Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity would be expected to increase the clearance of drug1 , resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of drug2 . 
Coadministration of drug1 and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may decrease the clearance of drug2 and may result in increased plasma concentrations of drug3 .

Interactions for drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) : drug6 : drug7 has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of drug8 ; 
as such it may impair intestinal absorption of any of drug1 . 
drug1 / drug2 : The coadministration of drug3 or drug4 will not affect plasma concentrations of drug5 , but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of drug6 /ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism . 
Since blood level of drug1 /ergocalcitriol will be reduced , higher doses of drug2 may be necessary if these drugs are administered simultaneously . 
drug1 : drug2 are known to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of calcium excretion in urine . 
Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 causes hypercalcemia . 
Therefore , precaution should be taken when coadministration is necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with drug3 , as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias . 
drug1 : drug2 may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of drug3 . 
Reductions in serum endogenous vitamin D concentrations have been observed following the administration of 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day drug1 for a week to healthy men . 
However , in vivo drug interaction studies of drug1 with drug2 have not been investigated . 
drug1 : A relationship of functional antagonism exists between drug2 , which promote calcium absorption , and drug3 , which inhibit calcium absorption . 
Phosphate-Binding Agents : Since drug1 also has an effect on phosphate transport in the intestine , kidneys and bones , the dosage of phosphate-binding agents must be adjusted in accordance with the serum phosphate concentration . 
drug1 : The coadministration of any of the drug2 should be avoided as this could create possible additive effects and hypercalcemia . 
drug1 Supplements : Uncontrolled intake of additional drug2 -containing preparations should be avoided . 
drug1 : drug2 -containing preparations ( eg , drug3 ) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with drug4 by patients on chronic renal dialysis . 
Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 - The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 ( debrisoquin hydroxylase ) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population ( about 7-10 % of caucasians are so called poor metabolizers ) ; 
reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian , African and other populations are not yet available . 
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of drug1 ( drug2 ) when given usual doses . 
Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large ( 8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the drug1 ) . 
In addition , certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers . 
An individual who is stable on a given dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy . 
The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme ( drug1 ; 
drug1 ) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 ( many other drug2 , drug3 , and the drug4 drug5 and drug6 ) . 
While all the selective drug1 ( drug2 ) , e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , inhibit P450 2D6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
The extent to which drug1 - drug2 interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug3 involved . 
Nevertheless , caution is indicated in the coadministration of drug1 with any of the drug2 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
Of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from drug1 , given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite ( at least 5 weeks may be necessary ) . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug2 or the other drug . 
Furthermore , whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy , an increased dose of drug1 may be required . 
It is desirable to monitor drug1 plasma levels whenever a drug2 is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 . 
drug1 : drug2 or similarly acting compounds ; 
drug1 medication ; 
drug1 , drug2 and other drug3 ; 
and drug1 When drug2 is given with drug3 agents or drug4 drugs , including drug5 combined with local drug6 , close supervision and careful adjustment of dosages are required . 
Hyperpyrexia has been reported when drug1 is administered with drug2 agents or with drug3 drugs , particularly during hot weather . 
Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking drug1 in combination with drug2 -type drugs . 
drug1 is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain drug2 , thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drug3 . 
Clinically significant effects have been reported with the drug1 when used concomitantly with drug2 . 
Increases in plasma levels of drug1 , and in the frequency and severity of side effects , particularly drug2 , have been reported when drug3 was added to the drug4 regimen . 
Discontinuation of drug1 in well-controlled patients receiving drug2 and drug3 may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the drug4 . 
Caution is advised if patients receive large doses of drug1 concurrently . 
Transient delirium has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of drug1 and 75 - 150 mg of drug2 . 
Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 , including drug2 , are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs test . 
Steady state plasma drug1 concentrations did not appear to change . 
Therefore , monitoring of plasma drug1 levels may be indicated in patients receiving similar combination chemotherapy regimens . 
The utilization of drug1 for such patients may be considered as an alternative . 
Also drug1 . 
No information provided 
drug1 : Aerosol drug2 of the short-acting adrenergic stimulant type may be used for relief of breakthrough symptoms while using drug3 . 
However , increasing use of such preparations to control symptoms indicates deterioration of asthma control and the need to reassess the patient s therapy . 
Concomitant administration of other drug1 may potentiate the undesirable effects of drug2 . 
drug1 and drug2 : drug3 should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with drug4 or drug5 because the action of drug6 on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 : Concomitant treatment with drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 may potentiate a possible hypokalemic effect of drug7 
Hypokalemia may increase susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with drug1 . 
-adrenergic Blockers : -adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of drug1 . 
Therefore drug1 should not be given together with -adrenergic blockers ( including eye drops ) unless there are compelling reasons for their use . 
Other Drugs : Drugs such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 may be associated with QT-interval prolongation and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia . 
INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT OR GUARDIAN See illustrated Information For The Patient or Guardian section . 
It is important that patients understand how to use drug1 ( drug2 ) capsules with the supplied AerolizerTM inhalation device and how it should be used in relation to other asthma or COPD medications they are taking . 
Patients/Guardians should be given the following information : i . 
The recommended dosage ( one or two capsules twice daily , morning and evening ) should not be exceeded . 
ii . 
drug1 is not meant to relieve acute asthma or COPD symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose . 
Acute symptoms should be treated with a short-acting , inhaled drug1 such as drug2 ( the physician should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used ) . 
iii . 
The physician should be notified immediately if any of the following situations occur , which may be a sign of seriously worsening asthma : Decreased effectiveness of drug1 ; 
Need for more inhalations than usual of drug1 . 
iv . 
drug1 should not be used as a substitute for oral or inhaled drug2 . 
The dosage of these medications should not be changed and they should not be stopped without consulting the physician , even if the patient feels better after initiating treatment with drug1 . 
v. Patients should be cautioned regarding potential adverse cardiovascular effects , such as palpitations or chest pain . 
vi . 
In patients receiving drug1 , other inhaled medications should be used only as directed by the physician . 
vii . 
Guardians of children who have been prescribed drug1 should be alerted to the general concern regarding asthma therapy compliance , especially neglect of anti-inflammatory therapy and overuse of drug2 . 
drug1 may increase slightly the effect of drug2 , e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 . 
Other drug1 should be used with caution in patients taking drug2 , since the effects may be additive . 
drug1 including coumarin derivatives , indandione derivatives , and drug2 such as drug3 ( drug4 ) , and drug5 may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with drug6 . 
A 30 to 45 % increase in AUC and Cmax of drug1 was observed with concomitant administration of drug2 twice daily . 
drug1 150 mg twice daily did not interact significantly with drug2 ( AUC was decreased by 15-20 % ) . 
No pharmacodynamic effects of either drug1 were observed . 
Coadministration of drug1 with 40 mg drug2 tablets in epileptic patients lowered the drug3 plasma concentrations to undetectable levels . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided and alternative drug3 therapy should be considered . 
Pharmacokinetic interactions between drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 ) were variable and not significant . 
drug1 attenuated the heart rate increase following administration of immediate release drug2 . 
The blood pressure effect of drug1 tended to be greater in patients on drug2 than in patients on no other drug3 therapy . 
drug1 at 648 mg bid decreased the bioavailability ( AUC ) of drug2 by 26 % , but not the peak concentration . 
The immediate release , but not the coat-core formulation of drug1 increased plasma drug2 concentrations by about 20 % . 
This interaction was not accompanied by ECG changes and its clinical significance is not known . 
No significant interactions were found between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 . 
Hypotension : Patients on Diuretic Therapy : Patients on drug1 and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted , may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug2 or drug3 . 
The possibility of hypotensive effects with drug1 or drug2 can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug3 or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug4 or drug5 . 
If it is necessary to continue the drug1 , provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour . . 
Agents Causing Renin Release : The antihypertensive effect of drug1 and drug2 IV is augmented by drug3 that cause renin release ( e.g. , drug4 ) . 
drug1 : In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with drug2 , the co-administration of drug3 may result in a further deterioration of renal function . 
These effects are usually reversible . 
In a clinical pharmacology study , drug1 or drug2 was administered to hypertensive patients receiving drug3 . 
In this study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of drug1 . 
However , reports suggest that drug1 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug2 . 
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
Other Cardiovascular Agents : drug1 and drug2 IV have been used concomitantly with drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and drug9 without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions . 
drug1 IV has been used concomitantly with drug2 without evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions . 
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium : drug1 and drug2 IV attenuate potassium loss caused by drug3 . 
drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 ) , drug5 supplements , or drug6 -containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium . 
Therefore , if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia , they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium . 
Potassium sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure receiving drug1 . 
drug1 : drug2 toxicity has been reported in patients receiving drug3 concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium , including drug4 . 
It is recommended that serum drug1 levels be monitored frequently if drug2 is administered concomitantly with drug3 . 
drug1 should be administered with caution to patients receiving drug2 ( drug3 , Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories ) . 
In a single study , rats given high intraperitoneal doses of an drug1 plus drug2 experienced severe toxicity , including convulsions and death . 
Concomitant use of drug1 and other drug2 is generally not recommended because of possible potentiating effects . 
This is especially true in patients who may subject themselves to an overdosage of drugs . 
If combination therapy is needed , careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of all agents to be used . 
The monoamine oxidase inhibitory effects of drug1 may persist for a substantial period after discontinuation of the drug , and this should be borne in mind when another drug is prescribed following drug2 . 
To avoid potentiation , the physician wishing to terminate treatment with drug1 and begin therapy with another agent should allow for an interval of 10 days . 
drug1 / drug2 , drug3 , Including drug4 
The administration of local drug1 containing drug2 or drug3 to patients receiving drug4 , drug5 or drug6 may produce severe , prolonged hypotension or hypertension . 
Concurrent use of these agents should generally be avoided . 
In situations when concurrent therapy is necessary , careful patient monitoring is essential . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 ( for the treatment of hypotension related to obstetric blocks ) and drug2 may cause severe , persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents . 
The para-aminobenzoic acid metabolite of chloroprocaine inhibits the action of drug1 . 
Therefore , drug1 should not be used in any condition in which a drug2 is being employed . 
drug1 including drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 HC1 : Concomitant use of drug5 and non-selective drug6 may cause hypertension . 
Concurrent use with drug1 or other drugs significantly eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may result in increased plasma concentrations of drug2 . 
The conversion of drug1 to drug2 is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase . 
Interactions with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme could potentially occur . 
drug1 : drug2 enhances the effect of drug3 . 
Therefore , when drug1 is given to a patient receiving drug2 , the dosage of drug3 should be reduced to prevent excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time . 
drug1 : Concurrent administration of drug2 may lower drug3 plasma levels , possibly by competing for protein-binding sites . 
The urinary excretion of drug1 is unaffected by drug2 , indicating no change in drug3 absorption . 
drug1 does not affect serum drug2 levels . 
Greater fecal blood loss results from concomitant administration of both drugs than from either drug alone . 
drug1 : The concurrent administration of drug2 does not affect the bioavailability of drug3 . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 s does not interfere with absorption of drug4 . 
drug1 may affect central nervous function . 
Therefore , interactions could occur following concomitant administration of drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) . 
Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 ) , myelotoxic ( e.g. , drug3 chemotherapy ) , cardiotoxic ( e.g. , drug4 ) or hepatotoxic ( e.g. , drug5 , drug6 ) effects with drug7 may increase toxicity in these organ systems . 
The safety and efficacy of drug1 in combination with any drug2 have not been established . 
In addition , reduced kidney and liver function secondary to drug1 treatment may delay elimination of concomitant medications and increase the risk of adverse events from those drugs . 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose drug1 and drug2 , specifically , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 . 
These reactions consisted of erythema , pruritus , and hypotension and occurred within hours of administration of chemotherapy . 
These events required medical intervention in some patients . 
Myocardial injury , including myocardial infarction , myocarditis , ventricular hypokinesia , and severe rhabdomyolysis appear to be increased in patients receiving drug1 and drug2 concurrently . 
Exacerbation or the initial presentation of a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been observed following concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 , including crescentic IgA glomerulonephritis , oculo-bulbar myasthenia gravis , inflammatory arthritis , thyroiditis , bullous pemphigoid , and Stevens-Johnson syndrome . 
Although drug1 have been shown to reduce drug2 -induced side effects including fever , renal insufficiency , hyperbilirubinemia , confusion , and dyspnea , concomitant administration of these agents with drug3 may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of drug4 and thus should be avoided. 12 drug5 and other drug6 may potentiate the hypotension seen with drug7 . 
Delayed Adverse Reactions to drug1 : A review of the literature revealed that 12.6 % ( range 11-28 % ) of 501 patients treated with various drug2 containing regimens who were subsequently administered drug3 experienced acute , atypical adverse reactions . 
The onset of symptoms usually occurred within hours ( most commonly 1 to 4 hours ) following the administration of contrast media . 
These reactions include fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , pruritus , rash , diarrhea , hypotension , edema , and oliguria . 
Some clinicians have noted that these reactions resemble the immediate side effects caused by drug1 administration , however the cause of contrast reactions after interleukin-2 therapy is unknown . 
Most events were reported to occur when contrast media was given within 4 weeks after the last dose of drug1 . 
These events were also reported to occur when contrast media was given several months after drug1 treatment . 
Drugs that may alter drug1 plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase drug2 plasma concentrations : Caution is recommended when administering drug3 with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family ( e.g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 ) . 
Substances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme ( CYP3A4 ) activity may decrease metabolism and increase drug1 concentrations . 
There is a significant increase in exposure to drug1 when drug2 is coadministered with drug3 ( CYP3A4 inhibitor ) . 
Drugs that may decrease drug1 plasma concentrations : Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may increase metabolism and decrease drug2 plasma concentrations . 
Co-medications that induce CYP3A4 ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 or St. 
Johns Wort ) may significantly reduce exposure to drug1 . 
Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of drug1 followed by a single dose of drug2 , increased drug3 oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold , which significantly ( p 0.05 ) decreased mean cmax and AUC ( 0-8 ) . 
In patients where drug1 or other CYP3A4 inducers are indicated , alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential should be considered . 
Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by drug1 drug2 increases the mean cmax and AUC of drug3 ( CYP3A4 substrate ) 2- and 3.5-fold , respectively , suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by drug4 . 
Particular caution is recommended when administering drug1 with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window ( e.g. , drug2 or drug3 ) . 
drug1 will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs ( e.g. , triazolo- drug2 , drug3 , certain drug4 , etc . ) . 
Because drug1 is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 , patients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular weight or standard drug2 . 
in vitro , drug1 inhibits the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 activity at similar concentrations that affect CYP3A4 activity . 
Systemic exposure to substrates of CYP2D6 is expected to be increased when coadministered with Gleevec . 
No specific studies have been performed and caution is recommended . 
in vitro , drug1 inhibits acetaminophen O-glucuronidation ( Ki value of 58.5 M ) at therapeutic levels .

Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 or potent drug3 such as drug4 . 
Renal function should be carefully monitored , especially if higher dosages of the drug1 are to be administered or if therapy is prolonged , because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of drug2 . 
Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were not noted when drug1 was given alone in clinical trials . 
drug1 has been shown to be antagonistic to drug2 , including drug3 , based on in vitro studies and time kill curves with enteric gram-negative bacilli . 
Due to the possibility of antagonism in vivo , particularly when bactericidal activity is desired , this drug combination should be avoided . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The administration of drug1 may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using CLINITEST tablets , Benedicts solution , or Fehlings solution . 
It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions ( such as CLINISTIX or TES-TAPE ) be used . 
Some drug1 , including drug2 , have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of drug3 . 
This may lead to reduced clearance of drug1 and a prolongation of its serum half-life . 
Some drug1 , including drug2 , have been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving drug3 concomitantly . 
drug1 : The concomitant administration of drug2 with the drug3 drug4 has , on rare occasions , resulted in severe hypoglycemia . 
drug1 : drug2 appear to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of drug3 . 
drug1 Renal tubular transport of drug2 may be inhibited by concomitant administration of drug3 , potentially leading to increased plasma levels of drug4 . 
This might increase the risk of drug1 toxic reactions . 
Therefore , patients under drug1 therapy should be carefully monitored when concomitant drug2 therapy is indicated . 
Multivalent Cation-Containing Products : Concurrent administration of a drug1 , including drug2 , with multivalent cation-containing products such as drug3 or drug4 drug5 , drug6 , drug7 chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder , or products containing drug8 , drug9 , or drug10 may substantially decrease the absorption of drug11 , resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired . 
drug1 should be administered at least 4 hours before or 2 hours after these products . 
This time window is different than for other oral formulations of drug1 , which are usually administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after drug2 . 
drug1 ( but not drug2 ) : These drugs in combination with very high doses of drug3 have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre-clinical studies . 
drug1 : The rate and extent of absorption of drug2 was bioequivalent when drug3 was given alone or when drug4 was given 2 hours after drug5 at the dose that maximally suppresses gastric acid secretion . 
drug1 should be taken as directed and drug2 should be taken with a main meal of the day , preferably the evening meal . . 
drug1 : Altered serum levels of drug2 ( increased and decreased ) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 interferes with renal tubular secretion of drug3 and produces an increase in the level of drug4 in serum . 
drug1 : As with some other drug2 , concurrent administration of drug3 with drug4 may lead to elevated serum concentrations of drug5 and prolongation of its elimination half-life . 
This may result in increased risk of drug1 -related adverse reactions . 
If concomitant use cannot be avoided , serum levels of drug1 should be monitored and dosage adjustments made as appropriate . 
drug1 : drug2 have been reported to enhance the effects of the oral drug3 drug4 or its derivatives . 
When these products are administered concomitantly , prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be monitored . 
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
Several drug interaction studies have been completed with both drug1 and drug2 . 
Observations from drug interaction studies with drug1 may not be predictive for drug2 . 
Because drug1 is coadministered , prescribers should also refer to the prescribing information for drug2 regarding drug interactions associated with this agent . 
The metabolism of drug1 is mediated by cytochrome P450 , with the specific isoenzyme CYP3A4 responsible for 90 % of the hepatic metabolism . 
Additionally , drug1 is a substrate for P-Glycoprotein ( Pgp ) . 
Therefore , drugs that affect CYP3A4 and/or Pgp , may modify the pharmacokinetics of drug1 . 
Similarly , drug1 might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4 or Pgp . 
Drugs that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events are listed CONTRAINDICATIONS . 
Additional drugs that are not recommended for coadministration with drug1 and drug2 are included below . 
These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious events or loss of efficacy .

A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration ( Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers ) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 ( drug4 , drug5 , drug6 : Skeletal Muscle . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : drug3 plasma concentrations were not affected by co-administration of drug4 . 
drug1 : drug2 plasma concentrations were not affected by co-administration of drug3 . 
drug1 : The influence of the bile-acidsequestering agent drug2 on the pharmacokinetits of drug3 was evaluated in 12 healthy males in 2 separate randomized crossover studies . 
In the first study , concomitant administration of 0.2 mg drug1 and 12 g drug2 resulted in decreases of more than 22 % for AUC and 40 % for Cmax when compared to dosing drug3 alone . 
However , in the second study , administration of 12 g drug1 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg drug2 approximately 4 hours after the same evening meal resulted in a decrease in the drug3 AUC of less than 8 % , and a decrease in Cmax of about 30 % when compared to dosing drug4 alone . 
Therefore , it would be expected that a dosing schedule of drug1 given at bedtime and drug2 given before the evening meal would not result in a significant decrease in the clinical effect of drug3 . 
drug1 : Plasma drug2 levels and drug3 clearance at steady-state were not affected by co-administration of 0.2 mg drug4 . 
drug1 plasma concentrations were also not affected by co-administration of drug2 . 
drug1 : Co- administration of drug2 and drug3 to healthy volunteers did not result in any changes in prothrombin time or clotting factor VII when compared to co-administration of drug4 and placebo . 
The AUC and Cmax of both the ( R ) and ( S ) isomers of drug1 were unaffected by concurrent dosing of 0.3 mg drug2 . 
Co-administration of drug1 and drug2 did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
drug1 : In hypercholesterolemic patients , steady-state drug2 AUC and Cmax increased approximately 50 % and 24 % respectively after 10 days with co-administration of drug3 , a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 . 
OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY : Although specific interaction studies were not performed , in clinical studies , drug1 was used concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 ( drug7 ) without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions . 
Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when drug1 is administered concomitantly with other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 or some drug8 . 
drug1 may interfere with the absorption of drug2 . 
Administer drug1 before meals ; 
drug1 after meals . 
drug1 is metabolized to drug2 by the cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) enzyme group , specifically cytochromes P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) and CYP2C8 . 
The CYP3A4 isoenzyme is present in both the liver and intestines . 
drug1 is also known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 . 
Therefore , drug1 has the potential for interactions with drugs or substances that may be substrates , inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 . 
While only a limited number of in vivo drug-drug interactions with drug1 have been reported , chiefly with the oral formulation , the potential for other interactions should be anticipated . 
This is especially important for drugs associated with serious toxicity , such as other drug1 . 
If such drugs are needed , their dose should be reassessed and , where appropriate , plasma concentration measured . 
In view of the long and variable half-life of drug1 , potential for drug interactions exists not only with concomitant medication but also with drugs administered after discontinuation of drug2 . 
Since drug1 is a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 , drugs/substances that inhibit these isoenzymes may decrease the metabolism and increase serum concentration of drug2 . 
Reported examples include the following : drug1 : drug2 are known to inhibit CYP3A4 to varying degrees . 
A case report of one patient taking drug1 200 mg and drug2 800 mg three times a day resulted in increases in drug3 concentrations from 0.9 mg/L to 1.3 mg/L . 
DEA concentrations were not affected . 
There was no evidence of toxicity . 
Monitoring for drug1 toxicity and serial measurement of drug2 serum concentration during concomitant drug3 therapy should be considered . 
drug1 : drug2 inhibits CYP3A4 and can increase serum drug3 levels . 
Other substances : Grapefruit juice given to healthy volunteers increased drug1 AUC by 50 % and Cmax by 84 % , resulting in increased plasma levels of drug2 . 
Grapefruit juice should not be taken during treatment with oral amiodarone . 
This information should be considered when changing from intravenous drug1 to oral drug2 . 
drug1 may suppress certain CYP450 enzymes , including drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
This inhibition can result in unexpectedly high plasma levels of other drug1 which are metabolized by those CYP450 enzymes . 
Reported examples of this interaction include the following : drug1 s : drug2 ( drug3 substrate ) administered in combination with oral drug4 has been reported to produce persistently elevated plasma concentrations of drug5 resulting in elevated creatinine , despite reduction in dose of drug6 . 
drug1 : drug2 ( drug3 substrate ) in combination with drug4 has been associated with reports of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis . 
Cardiovasculars : drug1 : In patients receiving drug2 therapy , administration of oral drug3 regularly results in an increase in serum drug4 concentration that may reach toxic levels with resultant clinical toxicity . 
drug1 taken concomitantly with drug2 increases the serum drug3 concentration by 70 % after one day . 
On administration of oral drug1 , the need for drug2 therapy should be reviewed and the dose reduced by approximately 50 % or discontinued . 
If drug1 treatment is continued , serum levels should be closely monitored and patients observed for clinical evidence of toxicity . 
These precautions probably should apply to drug1 administration as well . 
drug1 : Other drug2 drugs , such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 , have been used concurrently with drug7 . 
There have been case reports of increased steady-state levels of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 during concomitant therapy with drug4 . 
drug1 decreases serum amiodarone levels . 
drug1 taken concomitantly with drug2 increases drug3 serum concentration by 33 % after two days . 
drug1 taken concomitantly with drug2 for less than seven days increases plasma concentrations of drug3 and n-acetyl drug4 by 55 % and 33 % , respectively . 
drug1 and procainamide doses should be reduced by one-third when either is administered with drug2 . 
Plasma levels of drug1 have been reported to increase in the presence of oral drug2 ; 
because of this , the dosage of drug1 should be adjusted when these drug2 are administered concomitantly . 
In general , any added drug1 should be initiated at a lower than usual dose with careful monitoring . 
Combination of drug1 with other drug2 therapy should be reserved for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent or incompletely responsive to drug3 . 
During transfer to oral drug1 , the dose levels of previously administered agents should be reduced by 30 to 50 % several days after the addition of oral drug2 . 
The continued need for the other drug1 agent should be reviewed after the effects of drug2 have been established , and discontinuation ordinarily should be attempted . 
If the treatment is continued , these patients should be particularly carefully monitored for adverse effects , especially conduction disturbances and exacerbation of tachyarrhythmias , as drug1 is continued . 
In drug1 -treated patients who require additional drug2 therapy , the initial dose of such agents should be approximately half of the usual recommended dose . 
drug1 : drug2 should be used with caution in patients receiving - drug3 blocking agents ( e.g. , drug4 , a drug5 inhibitor ) or drug6 antagonists ( e.g. , drug7 , a drug8 substrate , and drug9 , a drug10 inhibitor ) because of the possible potentiation of bradycardia , sinus arrest , and AV block ; 
if necessary , drug1 can continue to be used after insertion of a pacemaker in patients with severe bradycardia or sinus arrest . 
drug1 : Potentiation of drug2 -type ( drug3 and drug4 substrate ) drug5 response is almost always seen in patients receiving drug6 and can result in serious or fatal bleeding . 
Since the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 increases the prothrombin time by 100 % after 3 to 4 days , the dose of the drug3 should be reduced by one-third to one-half , and prothrombin times should be monitored closely . 
Some drug1 /substances are known to accelerate the metabolism of drug2 by stimulating the synthesis of drug3 ( enzyme induction ) . 
This may lead to low drug1 serum levels and potential decrease in efficacy . 
Reported examples of this interaction include the following : drug1 : drug2 is a potent inducer of drug3 . 
Administration of drug1 concomitantly with oral drug2 has been shown to result in decreases in serum concentrations of drug3 and drug4 . 
Other substances , including herbal preparations : St. John s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) induces CYP3A4 . 
Since drug1 is a substrate for drug2 , there is the potential that the use of St. John s Wort in patients receiving drug3 could result in reduced drug4 levels . 
Other reported interactions with drug1 : drug2 ( drug3 substrate ) in combination with drug4 may cause hypotension , bradycardia , and decreased cardiac output . 
Sinus bradycardia has been reported with oral drug1 in combination with drug2 ( drug3 substrate ) given for local drug4 . 
Seizure , associated with increased drug1 concentrations , has been reported with concomitant administration of intravenous drug2 . 
drug1 is a substrate for both drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 inhibits drug2 . 
drug1 increases enterohepatic elimination of drug2 and may reduce its serum levels and drug3 /2 . 
drug1 increases QT prolongation which could cause arrhythmia . 
drug1 , drug2 , and azoles are known to cause QTc prolongation . 
There have been reports of QTc prolongation , with or without TdP , in patients taking drug1 when drug2 , drug3 , or azoles were administered concomitantly . 
Hemodynamic and electrophysiologic interactions have also been observed after concomitant administration with drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 . 
Volatile drug1 Agents : . 
In addition to the interactions noted above , chronic ( 2 weeks ) oral drug1 administration impairs metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
Electrolyte Disturbances Patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should have the condition corrected whenever possible before being treated with drug1 , as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP . 
Special attention should be given to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or in patients receiving concomitant drug1 . 
Concomitant oral administration of drug1 ( a known inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa ) caused an eight-fold increase of the systemic exposure to oral drug2 . 
If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity ( such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , etc. ) is indicated , reduction of the drug7 dose should be considered . 
After extensive intake of grapefruit juice ( which inhibits CYP3A4 activity predominantly in the intestinal mucosa ) , the systemic exposure for oral drug1 increased about two times . 
As with other drugs primarily being metabolized through CYP3A4 , ingestion of grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided in connection with drug1 administration . 
Plasma levels of drug1 may become subtherapeutic during drug2 therapy . 
drug1 is inhibited by drug2 . 
The action of drug1 is potentiated by drug2 . 
drug1 may increase sensitivity to the drug2 . 
Response to drug1 may be enhanced by drug2 . 
No formal assessments of drug-drug interactions between drug1 and other agents have been conducted 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
drug1 : Since drug2 is contraindicated in patients with drug3 -induced thrombocytopenia , the co-administration of drug4 and drug5 is unlikely for this indication . 
However , if drug1 is to be initiated after cessation of drug2 therapy , allow sufficient time for heparins effect on the aPTT to decrease prior to initiation of drug3 therapy . 
drug1 / drug2 : Pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions have not been demonstrated between drug3 and concomitantly administered drug4 ( 162.5 mg orally given 26 and 2 hours prior to initiation of drug5 1 g/kg/min. over 4 hours ) or drug6 ( 1000 mg orally given 12 , 6 and 0 hours prior to , and 6 and 12 hours subsequent to , initiation of drug7 1.5 g/kg/min. over 18 hours ) . 
Oral drug1 : Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between drug2 and drug3 ( 7.5 mg single oral dose ) have not been demonstrated . 
However , the concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 ( 5-7.5 mg initial oral dose followed by 2.5-6 mg/day orally for 6-10 days ) results in prolongation of the prothrombin time ( PT ) and International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) . 
drug1 : The safety and effectiveness of drug2 with drug3 have not been established . 
Co-administration : Concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , and other drug4 may increase the risk of bleeding . 
Drug-drug interactions have not been observed between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 . 
Possible drug interactions of drug1 with drug2 or with other drug3 . 
drug1 may have life-threatening interactions with drug2 . 
drug1 may enhance the effects of drug2 , drug3 , and other drug4 . 
drug1 may block the antihypertensive action of drug2 and similarly acting compounds . 
drug1 may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking drug2 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
drug1 in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of drug2 , drug3 and drug4 , and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients . 
Preliminary animal and human studies have shown that small quantities of systemically administered drug1 enter the CSF primarily as 5-methyltetrahydro-folate and , in humans , remain 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual drug2 concentrations following intrathecal administration . 
However , high doses of drug1 may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered drug2 . 
drug1 may enhance the toxicity of drug2 . 
Certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by drug1 -containing oral drug2 . 
The following similar changes may be expected with larger doses of drug1 : Increased sulfobromophthalein retention ; 
increased prothrombin and factors VII , VIII , IX , and X ; 
decreased antithrombin 3 ; 
increased norepinephrine-induced platel et aggregation ; 
increased thyroid binding globulin ( TBG ) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone , as measured by PBI , T4 by column , or T4 by radioimmunoassay . 
Free T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG ; 
free T4 concentration is unaltered : impaired glucose tolerance ; 
decreased pregnanediol excretion ; 
reduced response to metyrapone test ; 
reduced serum folate concentration ; 
increased serum triglyceride and phospholipid concentration . 
The administration of local drug1 containing drug2 or drug3 to patients receiving drug4 or drug5 may produce severe , prolonged hypertension . 
Concurrent use of these agents should generally be avoided . 
In situations in which concurrent therapy is necessary , careful patient monitoring is essential . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 and of drug2 may cause severe , persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents . 
drug1 and drug2 may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of drug3 . 
The coadministration of drug1 decreases the biologic half-life of drug2 because of an increase in metabolic clearance that results in a greater amount of drug3 in the urine . 
Although the mechanism of interaction between drug1 and drug2 is not totally known , enzyme induction and displacement of drug3 from plasma albumin binding sites are possibilities . 
Because drug1 has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with drug2 alone and because drug3 increases the rate of excretion of drug4 , the concomitant use of drug5 and drug6 is not recommended . 
Chronic administration of drug1 , a known enzyme inducer , may be associated with a decrease in the plasma half-life of drug2 . 
When drug1 is added to or withdrawn from treatment , dosage adjustment of drug2 may be required . 
In vitro studies have shown that drug1 , because of its affinity for albumin , may displace from their binding sites other drugs that are also albumin bound , and this may lead to drug interaction . 
Theoretically , drug1 could likewise be displaced . 
Patients receiving drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 should be observed for increased activity of these drugs and , therefore , signs of toxicity from these drugs . 
In patients receiving drug1 , the addition of drug2 to therapy could prolong the prothrombin time . 
Patients receiving both drugs should be under careful observation . 
Patients treated with drug1 may be resistant to the effects of drug2 . 
In patients receiving drug1 and a drug2 concomitantly , any reduction in drug3 dosage should be gradual in order to avoid the possible complications of sudden drug4 withdrawal . 
No information available . 
None Reported 
Clinical interaction studies with drug1 and drug2 indicated that the coadministration of drug3 with these drugs does not result in clinically- significant drug interactions . 
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) Coadministration of drug1 and drug2 20 mg daily resulted in a reduction of drug3 plasma levels by 38 % on average . 
There is no clinical experience to date on the use of drug1 in combination with other anticancer agents . 
Drug/Laboratory Test-Interactions None observed . 
Urinary acidifying agents These agents ( drug1 , drug2 , etc. ) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the drug3 molecule , thereby increasing urinary excretion . 
Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of drug1 . 
drug1 drug2 are inhibited by drug3 . 
drug1 , drug2 drug3 may enhance the activity of drug4 or drug5 ; 
drug1 with drug2 or drug3 and possibly other drug4 cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of drug5 in the brain ; 
cardiovascular effects can be potentiated . 
drug1 drug2 , as well as a metabolite of drug3 , slow drug4 metabolism . 
This slowing potentiates drug1 , increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings ; 
this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis . 
A variety of toxic neurological effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur , sometimes with fatal results . 
drug1 : drug2 may counteract the sedative effect of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 may antagonize the hypotensive effects of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors , thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of drug3 and can be used to treat drug4 poisoning . 
drug1 : drug2 may delay intestinal absorption of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 blocks dopamine receptors , thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of drug3 . 
drug1 : The anorectic and stimulatory effects of drug2 may be inhibited by drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 potentiate the analgesic effect of drug3 . 
drug1 therapy Urinary excretion of drug2 is increased , and efficacy is reduced by acidifying agents used in drug3 therapy . 
drug1 : drug2 enhance the adrenergic effect of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 may delay intestinal absorption of drug3 ; 
co-administration of drug1 may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action . 
drug1 : drug2 may delay intestinal absorption of drug3 ; 
co-administration of drug1 may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action . 
drug1 : In cases of drug2 overdosage , drug3 CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur . 
drug1 : drug2 inhibit the hypotensive effect of drug3 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : drug1 can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels . 
This increase is greatest in the evening . 
drug1 may interfere with urinary steroid determinations . 
No drug interactions have been observed with the drug1 Implant . 
There is limited experience with use of retinal tamponades in conjunction with the drug1 Implant . 
The results of a study of coadministration of drug1 ( 50 mg/kg ) with an drug2 containing drug3 to 13 patients with tuberculosis showed a reduction of mean serum concentrations and urinary excretion of drug4 of approximately 20 % and 13 % , respectively , suggesting that the oral absorption of drug5 may be reduced by these drug6 . 
It is recommended to avoid concurrent administration of drug1 with drug2 containing drug3 for at least 4 hours following drug4 administration . 
No specific drug interaction studies have been conducted . 
For information on the pharmacokinetics of drug1 and drug2 in combination , see Drug Interactions under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section . 
When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with drug1 . 
drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 : potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur . 
drug1 : ( oral agents and drug2 ) - dosage adjustment of the drug3 may be required . 
Other drug1 : additive effect or potentiation . 
drug1 and drug2 drug3 : Absorption of drug4 is impaired in the presence of drug5 . 
Single doses of either drug1 or drug2 drug3 bind the drug4 and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent , respectively . 
drug1 , drug2 : intensified electrolyte depletion , particularly hypokalemia . 
Pressor amines ( e.g. , drug1 ) : possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use . 
drug1 , nondepolarizing ( e.g. , drug2 ) : possible increased responsiveness to the drug3 . 
drug1 : generally should not be given with drug2 . 
drug1 reduce the renal clearance of drug2 and add a high risk of drug3 toxicity . 
Refer to the package insert for drug1 preparations before use of such preparations with drug2 . 
drug1 : In some patients , the administration of a drug2 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 . 
Therefore , when drug1 and drug2 are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the drug3 is obtained . 
drug1 : Because of the relationship of drug2 to drug3 , patients should be advised against taking drug4 containing drug5 to avoid additive toxic effects 
. 
drug1 : Concomitant treatment with drug2 and drug3 should be avoided because drug4 use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) , some of which involved concomitant use of drug5 
. 
Micro-dosed drug1 Preparations : Micro-dosed drug2 preparations ( minipills that do not contain an drug3 ) may be an inadequate method of contraception during drug4 therapy . 
Although other drug1 are highly effective , there have been reports of pregnancy from women who have used drug2 , as well as topical/injectable/implantable/insertable hormonal birth control products . 
These reports are more frequent for women who use only a single method of contraception . 
It is not known if drug1 differ in their effectiveness when used with drug2 . 
Therefore , it is critically important for women of childbearing potential to select and commit to use 2 forms of effective contraception simultaneously , at least 1 of which must be a primary form , unless absolute abstinence is the chosen method , or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy 
. 
drug1 : drug2 has not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of drug3 in a study in seven healthy volunteers . 
These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither drug1 nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme . 
drug1 is known to cause osteomalacia . 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between drug1 and drug2 . 
Therefore , caution should be exercised when using these drugs together 
. 
drug1 : drug2 are known to cause osteoporosis . 
No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between drug1 and drug2 . 
Therefore , caution should be exercised when using these drugs together . 
Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with drug1 , since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products . 
drug1 use is associated with depression in some patients . 
Pregnancies have been reported by users of drug1 who also used some form of St. Johns Wort . 
Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative results from 2 urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial drug1 prescription . 
The first test is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for drug1 ( a screening test ) . 
The second pregnancy test ( a confirmation test ) should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of drug1 therapy . 
For patients with amenorrhea , the second test should be done at least 11 days after the last act of unprotected sexual intercourse ( without using 2 effective forms of contraception ) . 
Each month of therapy , the patient must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test . 
A pregnancy test must be repeated each month prior to the female patient receiving each prescription 
. 
Lipids : Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions . 
After consumption of drug1 , at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made . 
It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to drug1 is established . 
The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is 1 patient in 4 on drug1 therapy 
. 
Liver Function Tests : Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials , and hepatitis has been reported , pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to drug1 has been established 
. 
Glucose : Some patients receiving drug1 have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar . 
In addition , new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during drug1 therapy , although no causal relationship has been established 
. 
CPK : Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on drug1 therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels ; 
however , the clinical significance is unknown . 
There have been rare postmarketing reports of rhabdomyolysis , some associated with strenuous physical activity . 
In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients ( 12 to 17 years ) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne , transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12 % of patients , including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain , arthralgia , limb injury , or muscle sprain . 
In these patients , approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks . 
No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial . 
No drug interaction studies were performed . 
No in vitro metabolism studies were performed . 
Both drug1 and its major metabolite , drug2 , are inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects . 
Therefore , unless otherwise specified , appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 has led to elevated plasma concentrations of drug3 , resulting in rare instances of life- threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and one death . 
Another oral drug1 , drug2 , inhibits the metabolism of drug3 , resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of drug4 and its active metabolite drug5 which may prolong QT intervals . 
In vitro data suggest that drug1 , when compared to drug2 , has a less pronounced effect on the biotransformation system responsible for the metabolism of drug3 . 
Based on the chemical resemblance of drug1 and drug2 , coadministration of drug3 with drug4 is contraindicated . 
Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral drug1 potently inhibits the metabolism of drug2 resulting in an eight-fold increase in the mean AUC of drug3 . 
Data suggest that coadministration of oral drug1 and drug2 can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG . 
In vitro data suggest that drug1 also markedly inhibits the biotransformation system mainly responsible for the metabolism of drug2 ; 
therefore concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 is contraindicated . 
Coadministration of drug1 with oral drug2 or drug3 has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs . 
This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects . 
These agents should not be used in patients treated with drug1 . 
If drug1 is administered parenterally , special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drug2 , drug3 or drug4 has led to increased plasma concentrations of the latter three drugs . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 concentrations should be monitored at the initiation of drug4 therapy and frequently thereafter , and the dose of these three drug products adjusted appropriately . 
Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients receiving drug1 administered alone ( at recommended dosages ) or concomitantly with drug2 including drug3 . 
When drug1 was coadministered with drug2 , drug3 , or H2antagonists , reduced plasma concentrations of drug4 were reported . 
The physician is advised to monitor the plasma concentrations of drug1 when any of these drugs is taken concurrently , and to increase the dose of drug2 if necessary . 
Although no studies have been conducted , concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 may alter the metabolism of drug3 ; 
therefore , plasma concentrations of drug1 should also be monitored when it is given concurrently with drug2 . 
It has been reported that drug1 enhances the anticoagulant effect of drug2 -like drugs . 
Therefore , prothrombin time should be carefully monitored in patients receiving drug1 and drug2 -like drugs simultaneously . 
Plasma concentrations of drug1 are reduced when given concurrently with drug2 . 
drug1 plasma concentrations should be monitored when drug2 and drug3 are coadministered . 
Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving drug1 and oral drug2 . 
Blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored when drug1 and oral drug2 are coadministered . 
Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients concomitantly receiving drug1 and drug2 . 
Edema has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving drug1 and drug2 . 
Appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary . 
The results from a study in which eight HIV-infected individuals were treated with drug1 , 8 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/day , showed that the pharmacokinetics of drug2 were not affected during concomitant administration of drug3 , 100 mg b.i.d. 
drug1 has been found to temporarily raise serum concentrations of drug2 . 
drug1 may potentiate the adverse effects of other drug2 administered concomitantly . 
In particular , convulsions have been reported when drug1 is administered with drug2 and special care should be taken when the treatment regimen includes both of these drugs . 
Excessive drug1 ingestion should be avoided because a psychotic reaction has been reported . 
Potentially fatal drug interactions may occur when coadministered with drug1 , as this may enhance cardiovascular depression and bradyarrhythmias may occur . 
drug1 ( neostgmine , drug2 ) , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 can enhance toxicity and cause cardio respiratory depression . 
In addition , neuromuscular blocking action is enhanced by general drug1 , local drug2 like drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
This drug may interact with drug1 or other drug2 ( may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or drug3 ) , drug4 or other medications with anticholinergic activity ( anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with drug5 ) , and drug6 ( concurrent use with drug7 may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of drug8 ) . 
Results from human in vitro metabolism studies and nonclinical studies show that drug1 ( drug2 ) is neither metabolized by nor inhibits or induces the cytochrome P450 pathway suggesting that drug3 is not likely to cause or be subject to P450-based metabolic drug interactions in man . 
Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of drug1 had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of drug2 and drug3 . 
Co-administration of single 25-mg dose drug1 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of total drug2 . 
Expected changes in laboratory assessments of PT and INR were observed after drug1 administration , but these changes were not affected by concomitant drug2 administration . 
Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System drug1 is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system ( CYP3A4 ) , therefore potential interactions may occur when drug2 is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity . 
Coadminstration with agents that induce 3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of drug1 . 
The concomitant use of transdermal drug1 with drug2 or other potent 3A4 inhibitors such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and nefazadone may result in an increase in drug8 plasma concentrations . 
The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as drug1 and drug2 with transdermal drug3 may also result in an increase in drug4 plasma concentrations , which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression . 
In this situation , special patient care and observation are appropriate . 
drug1 : The concomitant use of drug2 ( drug3 transdermal system ) with other drug4 , including but not limited to other drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ( e.g. , drug9 ) , general drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , and drug13 , may cause respiratory depression , hypotension , and profound sedation , or potentially result in coma or death . 
When such combined therapy is contemplated , the dose of one or both agents should be significantly reduced . 
drug1 : drug2 is not recommended for use in patients who have received drug3 within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by drug4 has been reported with drug5 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
drug1 , apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems , has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , certain drug8 , drug9 , drug10 and drug11 , thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs . 
Clinically significant effects have been reported with the drug1 ; 
therefore , close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended , and adjustment of the drug1 dose may be necessary when drug2 is administered concomitantly . 
Interaction with drug1 , drug2 and drug3 has also been reported to produce adverse clinical effects . 
However , a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either drug1 300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage of drug2 ( drug3 , Key Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ) demonstrated less alteration in steady-state drug4 peak serum levels with the 800 mg h.s. regimen , particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older . 
Data beyond 10 days are not available . 
( Note : All patients receiving drug1 should be monitored appropriately , regardless of concomitant drug therapy . ) 
Dosage of the drugs mentioned above and other similarly metabolized drugs , particularly those of low therapeutic ratio or in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment , may require adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered drug1 to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels . 
Alteration of pH may affect absorption of certain drugs ( e.g. , drug1 ) . 
If these products are needed , they should be given at least 2 hours before drug1 administration . 
Additional clinical experience may reveal other drugs affected by the concomitant administration of drug1 . 
General : Significant interactions may occur when drug1 is administered together with drugs that inhibit P450 2C9 . 
drug1 metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 2C9 in the liver . 
Co-administration of drug1 with drugs that are known to inhibit 2C9 should be done with caution . 
In vitro studies indicate that drug1 is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9 , 2C19 or 3A4 . 
In vitro studies also indicate that drug1 , although not a substrate , is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6 . 
Therefore , there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by P450 2D6 . 
Clinical studies with drug1 have identified potentially significant interactions with drug2 and drug3 . 
Experience with drug1 ( drug2 ) suggests the potential for interactions with drug3 and drug4 . 
The effects drug1 on the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 have been studied in vivo and clinically important interactions have not been found . 
drug1 : Reports suggest that drug2 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug3 . 
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : Clinical studies , as well as post marketing observations , have shown that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patients . 
This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
drug1 : drug2 can be used with low dose drug3 . 
However , concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications , compared to use of drug3 alone . 
Because of its lack of platelet effects , drug1 is not a substitute for drug2 for cardiovascular prophylaxis . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 at 200 mg QD resulted in a two-fold increase in drug3 plasma concentration . 
This increase is due to the inhibition of drug1 metabolism via P450 2C9 by drug2 ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Pharmacokinetics : Metabolism ) . 
drug1 should be introduced at the lowest recommended dose in patients receiving drug2 . 
drug1 : In a study conducted in healthy subjects , mean steady-state drug2 plasma levels increased approximately 17 % in subjects receiving drug3 450 mg BID with drug4 200 mg BID as compared to subjects receiving drug5 alone . 
Patients on drug1 treatment should be closely monitored when drug2 is introduced or withdrawn . 
drug1 : In an interaction study of rheumatoid arthritis patients taking drug2 , drug3 did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug4 . 
drug1 : The effect of drug2 on the anti-coagulant effect of drug3 was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of 2-5 mg of drug4 . 
In these subjects , drug1 did not alter the anticoagulant effect of drug2 as determined by prothrombin time . 
However , caution should be used when administering drug1 with drug2 since these patients are at increased risk of bleeding complications . 
May interact with other creams , lotions , or skin medicines when placed on the same areas of your skin that you are using drug1 . 
In vitro studies have shown that , because of its affinity for protein , drug1 may displace other protein-bound drugs from their binding site . 
Caution should be exercised when administering drug1 with drug2 since interactions have been seen with other drug3 . 
Concomitant administration of an drug1 -containing drug2 had no significant effect in the bioavailability of drug3 . 
When administered with food or milk , there is more rapid absorption ; 
however , the total amount of drug1 in the plasma is unchanged . 
Hypotension Patients on drug1 Therapy : Patients on drug2 and especially those in whom drug3 therapy was recently instituted , as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis , may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receiving the initial dose of drug4 . 
The possibility of hypotensive effects with drug1 can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug2 or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiation of treatment with drug3 ( drug4 tablets , USP ) or initiating therapy with small doses ( 6.25 or 12.5 mg ) . 
Alternatively , provide medical supervision for at least one hour after the initial dose . 
If hypotension occurs , the patient should be placed in a supine position and , if necessary , receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline . 
This transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses which can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion . 
Agents Having Vasodilator Activity : Data on the effect of concomitant use of other drug1 in patients receiving drug2 for heart failure are not available ; 
therefore , drug1 or other drug2 ( as used for management of angina ) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should , if possible , be discontinued before starting drug3 . 
If resumed during drug1 therapy , such agents should be administered cautiously , and perhaps at lower dosage . 
Agents Causing Renin Release drug1 's effect will be augmented by drug2 that cause renin release . 
For example , drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) may activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . 
Agents Affecting Sympathetic Activity The sympathetic nervous system may be especially important in supporting blood pressure in patients receiving drug1 alone or with drug2 . 
Therefore , agents affecting sympathetic activity ( e.g. , drug1 or drug2 ) should be used with caution . 
drug1 add some further antihypertensive effect to drug2 , but the overall response is less than additive . 
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Since drug1 decreases aldosterone production , elevation of serum potassium may occur . 
drug1 such as drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 , or drug5 supplements should be given only for documented hypokalemia , and then with caution , since they may lead to a significant increase of serum potassium . 
Salt substitutes containing drug1 should also be used with caution . 
Inhibitors Of Endogenous Prostaglandin Synthesis It has been reported that drug1 may reduce the antihypertensive effect of drug2 , especially in cases of low renin hypertension . 
Other drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) may also have this effect . 
drug1 : Increased serum drug2 levels and symptoms of drug3 toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant drug4 and drug5 therapy . 
These drugs should be coad-ministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 levels is recommended . 
If a drug1 is also used , it may increase the risk of drug2 toxicity . 
drug1 : In a study of young healthy male subjects no evidence of a direct pharmacokinetic drug2 - drug3 interaction could be found . 
drug1 : drug2 administered concurrently with drug3 does not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug4 in renally impaired hypertensive patients . 
drug1 : In a study of healthy male volunteers no significant pharmacokinetic interaction occurred when drug2 and drug3 were administered concomitantly for 6 days . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction drug1 may cause a false-positive urine test for acetone . 
drug1 : Patients on drug2 , especially those with intravascular volume depletion , may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug3 . 
The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug1 or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug2 . 
If this is not possible , the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . ) 
drug1 Supplements and drug2 : drug3 can attenuate potassium loss caused by drug4 . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and others ) or drug5 supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . 
Therefore , if concomitant use of such agents is indicated , they should be given with caution , and the patients serum potassium should be monitored frequently . 
drug1 : Increased serum drug2 levels and symptoms of drug3 toxicity have been reported in patients receiving drug4 during therapy with drug5 . 
These drugs should be coadministered with caution , and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 levels is recommended . 
If a drug1 is also used , the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased . 
drug1 : In a clinical pharmacology study , coadministration of an drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) with drug6 reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of drug7 as compared with drug8 administered alone , suggesting that drug9 may impair absorption of drug10 . 
Therefore , if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated , dosing should be separated by 2 hours . 
Other : Neither drug1 nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food . 
In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , and drug9 , the bioavailability of drug10 was not altered by coadministration of drug11 with any one of these drugs . 
In a study with concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 , the bioavailability of unbound drug3 was not altered . 
In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with drug1 , bioavailability parameters , the degree of protein binding , and the anticoagulant effect ( measured by prothrombin time ) of drug2 were not significantly changed . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction drug1 may cause a false low measurement of serum drug2 levels with the Digi- Tab RIA Kit for drug3 . 
Other kits , such as the Coat-A-Count RIA Kit , may be used . 
In vitro , drug1 has been shown to inhibit the activity of liver cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and therefore , may reduce the metabolism of compounds requiring these systems . 
Consequently , drugs with a low therapeutic margin , such as drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 , could have a delayed elimination and increases in their serum half-life leading to a toxic level . 
The dosage of these drugs or others with a similar metabolism may need to be modified if they are administered concomitantly with drug1 . 
For example , when drug1 are administered concomitantly with drug2 , prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and if necessary , the dosage of drug3 should be reduced . 
The hypoglycemic action of drug1 may be potentiated by certain drugs including drug2 and other drugs that are highly protein bound , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , and drug9 . 
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia . 
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for loss of control . 
Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control . 
These drugs include the drug1 and other drug2 , drug3 , phe-nothiazines , drug4 , drug5 , oral drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , sympathomimet-ics , drug9 , and drug10 . 
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be closely observed for loss of control . 
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia . 
A possible interaction between drug1 and drug2 , a drug3 , has been reported , resulting in a potentiation of the hypoglycemic action of drug4 . 
The mechanism for this interaction is not known . 
A potential interaction between oral drug1 and oral drug2 leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported . 
Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous , topical or vaginal preparations of drug1 is not known . 
drug1 : In a single-dose interaction study in NIDDM subjects , decreases in drug2 AUC and Cmax were observed , but were highly variable . 
The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between drug1 blood levels and pharmaco-dynamic effects , makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain . 
Coadministration of gly-buride and drug1 did not result in any changes in either drug2 pharmacokinetics or pharmaco-dynamics . 
Interations 
drug1 may interact with any of the following : - drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 ) ( with long-term , high-dose use ) or 
- drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) or

- drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) Use of drug3 with drug4 may increase the chance of side effects affecting the liver and/or the side effects of drug5 
drug1 toxicity may be aggravated by the initial release of norepinephrine caused by drug2 Injection . 
The pressor effects of drug1 such as drug2 or drug3 are enhanced by drug4 . 
When drug1 are administered , dilute solutions should be used and blood pressure should be monitored closely . 
Although there is little published information on concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 , these drugs are often administered concurrently without any evidence of interactions resulting in adverse effects or diminished efficacy . 
drug1 or other drug2 ( concurrent use with drug3 may result in uterine hypertonus , possibly causing uterine rupture or cervical laceration , especially in the absence of adequate cervical dilatation ; 
although combinations are sometimes used for therapeutic advantage , when used concurrently , patient should be closely monitored . 
No clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted . 
However , in a single in vivo rodent study drug1 had no effect on P450 levels . 
No formal drug-interaction studies have been performed , and a clinically significant interaction with other medications used in the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure cannot be excluded based on the available data . 
drug1 has been administered with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and high-frequency ventilation . 
Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility , drug1 , including drug2 and drug3 , may have an additive effect with drug4 on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia . 
An association between drug1 and an increased risk of methaemoglobinaemia , particularly in infants , has specifically been described in a literature case report . 
This risk is present whether the drugs are administered as oral , parenteral , or topical formulations . 
Interactions may occur with the following : adrenocorticoids ( cortisone-like medicine ) , drug1 ( drug2 s ) , drug3 , drug4 ( drug5 may decrease the effects of these medicines ) , drug6 ( using these medicines with drug7 may result in increased CNS depressant effects ) , drug8 , drug9 ( using these medicines with drug10 may change the amount of either medicine that you need to take ) , and oral drug11 containing drug12 ( drug13 may decrease the effectiveness of these oral drug14 , and you may need to change to a different type of birth control ) . 
A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of drug1 Gel , 5 % , in combination with double strength ( 160 mg/800 mg ) drug2 / drug3 ( drug4 / drug5 ) . 
During co-administration , systemic levels of drug1 and drug2 were essentially unchanged . 
Notably , systemic exposure ( AUC0-12 ) of drug1 ( drug2 ) was more than doubled in the presence of drug3 / drug4 . 
Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1 % of that from the 100 mg oral dose , even when co-administered with drug1 / drug2 . 
Certain concomitant medications ( such as drug1 , drug2 , St. 
John s wort ) may increase the formation of drug1 , a metabolite of drug2 associated with hemolysis . 
With oral drug1 treatment , drug2 such as drug3 have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
An encephalopathic syndrome ( characterized by weakness , lethargy , fever , tremulousness and confusion , extrapyramidal symptoms , leukocytosis , elevated serum enzymes , BUN , and FBS ) followed by irreversible brain damage has occurred in a few patients treated with drug1 plus drug2 . 
A causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 has not been established ; 
however , patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely for early evidence of neurological toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs appear . 
As with other drug1 , it should be noted that drug2 may be capable of potentiating drug3 such as drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
In a study of 12 schizophrenic patients coadministered oral drug1 and drug2 , plasma drug3 levels were decreased by a mean of 70 % and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline . 
In 5 other schizophrenic patients treated with oral drug1 and drug2 , discontinuation of drug3 produced a mean 3.3-fold increase in drug4 concentrations . 
Thus , careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when drug1 is administered or discontinued in drug2 -treated patients . 
Food : drug1 should not be administered with food . 
Studies have shown that the bioavailability of drug1 is reduced significantly when administered with food . 
drug1 : A report of severe drug2 toxicity was reported in a patient receiving drug3 . 
It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between drug1 and drug2 and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed . 
However , current evidence suggests that drug1 does induce P-450IIE1 , a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites , in the liver . 
Furthermore it has been proposed that drug1 resulted In induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which , in turn , resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested drug2 being converted to the toxic metabolites . 
Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with drug1 potentiates a cetaminophen hepatoxicity in rats . 
drug1 : drug2 is known to slow the metabolism of drug3 and increase its serum levels drug4 levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with drug5 , signs and symptoms of drug6 toxicity should be monitored closely , and appropriate dosage adjustment of the drug7 should be made . 
drug1 : Potential interaction of drug2 and drug3 may exist . 
drug1 : drug2 may increase serum levels of drug3 . 
To avoid drug1 intoxication , appropriate adjustment of the drug2 should be made . 
Therophylline : A recent study has shown that concomitan administration of drug1 and drug2 may cause elevated plasma levels of drug3 , and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of drug4 . 
Since the therapeutic range of drug1 is narrow drug2 serum levels should be monitored closely , and appropriate dosage adjustments of drug3 should be made . 
drug1 : A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of drug2 when co administered with drug3 . 
Plasma drug1 concentration should be monitored when drug2 and drug3 are co administered , and appropriate dosage adjustments of drug4 should be made . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 may cause severe orthostatic hypotension. drug3 , an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism , increased drug4 s half-life and toxicity in a rat model . 
Data from a randomized trial of drug1 and drug2 plus or minus drug3 in ovarian cancer indicated that drug4 significantly reduced neurotoxicity ; 
however , it adversely affected response duration suggesting that drug1 should not be administered with drug2 and/or drug3 .1 
No Important Interactions To Date drug1 does not have clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 or drug10 . 
Drug interaction studies with drug1 have not been performed in patients with severe sepsis . 
However , since there is an increased risk of bleeding with drug1 , caution should be employed when drug2 is used with other drugs that affect hemostasis . 
Approximately 2/3 of the patients in the Phase 3 study received either prophylactic low dose drug1 ( drug2 up to 15,000 units/day ) or prophylactic doses of drug3 as indicated in the prescribing information for the specific products . 
Concomitant use of prophylactic low dose drug1 did not appear to affect safety , however , its effects on the efficacy of drug2 have not been evaluated in an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Because drug1 may affect the APTT assay , drug2 present in plasma samples may interfere with one-stage coagulation assays based on the APTT ( such as factor VIII , IX , and XI assays ) . 
This interference may result in an apparent factor concentration that is lower than the true concentration . 
drug1 present in plasma samples does not interfere with one-stage factor assays based on the PT ( such as factor II , V , VII , and X assays ) . 
There is no known drug interference with standard clinical laboratory tests . 
drug1 enhance the renal toxicity of drug2 in animals. 7 drug3 interferes with the action of drug4 preparations by chelating the drug5 . 7 
drug1 can interact with drug2 or other drug3 ( may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or drug4 ) , drug5 or other medications with anticholinergic activity ( anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with drug6 ) , and drug7 ( concurrent use with drug8 may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of drug9 ) . 
A drug interaction study was performed in which drug1 was administered in combination with drug2 . 
There was no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interactions between drug1 and drug2 . 
Caution should be exercised when administering drug1 with drugs that are known to inhibit phosphatase activities ( e.g. , drug2 ) . 
High-dose drug1 resulting in concentrations above 2000 ng/mL administered with oral drug2 has led to an 80 % increase in drug3 exposure with a 38 % decrease in total body clearance of drug4 compared to drug5 alone . 
drug1 inhibited in vitro metabolic reactions catalyzed by cytochromes P450 1A2 , 2C8/9 , and 3A4 but only at relatively high concentrations . 
drug1 did not inhibit P450 2A6 or the polymorphic P450 2D6 in human liver microsomes . 
drug1 did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
Although there have been no formal interaction studies other than with drug1 , based on these in vivo and in vitro studies , it is unlikely that co-administration of a 1 mg dose of drug2 with other drugs will result in clinically significant drug inhibition of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of the other drugs . 
An interaction study with drug1 showed no clinically significant effect of drug2 on drug3 pharmacokinetics or anticoagulant activity . 
At a median follow-up of 33 months , the combination of drug1 and drug2 did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with drug3 in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor-positive subpopulation . 
This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial . 
Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the ATAC trial , drug1 should not be administered with drug2 ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Drug Interactions and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Clinical Studies - Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women subsections ) . 
Co-administration of drug1 and drug2 resulted in a reduction of drug3 plasma levels by 27 % compared with those achieved with drug4 alone . 
drug1 -containing therapies should not be used with drug2 as they may diminish its pharmacologic action . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions No clinically significant changes in the results of clinical laboratory tests have been observed 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
Treatment with drug1 once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy subjects was associated with an inhibition of P450 1A2 and a 25 % increase in drug2 AUC . 
drug1 serum levels should be monitored and appropriate dose adjustments considered for patients given both drug2 and drug3 . 
There was no effect on the pharmacokinetics of representative drugs metabolized by CYP 2C9 , CYP 2C19 , CYP 2D6 or CYP 3A4 . 
In patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with drug1 in combination with drug2 , drug3 treatment did not affect drug4 distribution or clearance . 
Nucleoside Analogues drug1 Co-administration of drug2 and drug3 is not recommended . 
Reports of fatal hepatic failure , as well as peripheral neuropathy , pancreatitis , and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in clinical trials . 
drug1 and drug2 drug3 can antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of drug4 and drug5 against HIV . 
Therefore , concomitant use of drug1 with either of these drugs should be avoided . 
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis drug1 has not been tested for its carcinogenic potential . 
Mutagenesis drug1 did not cause DNA damage when tested in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay and in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes , either in the presence or absence of metabolic activation . 
Use With drug1 drug2 is genotoxic and mutagenic . 
The carcinogenic potential of drug1 has not been fully determined . 
In a p53 ( +/- ) mouse carcinogenicity study at doses up to the maximum tolerated dose of 100 mg/kg/day drug1 was not oncogenic . 
However , on a body surface area basis , this dose was 0.5 times maximum recommended human 24-hour dose of drug1 . 
A study in rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of drug1 is ongoing . 
Mutagenesis Impairment of Fertility drug1 may impair fertility in women . 
Prolonged menstrual cycles and/or amenorrhea were observed in female cynomolgus monkeys given sc injections of 600 m g/kg/dose ( 7200 m g/m2/dose ) of drug1 every other day for one month , at approximately 180 times the recommended weekly human dose for a 60 kg person ( based on body surface area ) . 
Menstrual cycle irregularities were accompanied by both a decrease and delay in the peak 17b -estradiol and progesterone levels following administration of drug1 to female monkeys . 
A return to normal menstrual rhythm followed cessation of treatment . 
Every other day dosing with 100m g/kg ( 1200m g/m2 ) drug1 ( equivalent to approximately 30 times the recommended human dose ) had no effects on cycle duration or reproductive hormone status . 
The effects of drug1 on male fertility have not been studied . 
However , no adverse effects on fertility were observed in male Rhesus monkeys treated with non- drug1 for 5 months at doses up to 25 x 106 IU/kg/day . 
Pregnancy Pregnancy : Category C drug1 has not been studied for its teratogenic effect . 
drug1 treatment of pregnant Rhesus monkeys at approximately 20 to 500 times the human weekly dose resulted in a statistically significant increase in abortions . 
No teratogenic effects were seen in the offspring delivered at term . 
drug1 should be assumed to have abortifacient potential . 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of drug1 in pregnant women . 
drug1 is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus . 
drug1 is recommended for use in women of childbearing potential only when they are using effective contraception during therapy . 
Pregnancy : Category X : Use With drug1 ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to drug2 . 
drug1 therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant . 
If pregnancy occurs in a patient or partner of a patient during treatment or during the 6 months after treatment cessation , such cases should be reported to the drug1 Pregnancy Registry at 1-800-526-6367 . 
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether drug1 or drug2 or its components are excreted in human milk . 
The effect of orally ingested drug1 or drug2 from breast milk on the nursing infant has not been evaluated . 
Because of the potential for adverse reactions from the drugs in nursing infants , a decision must be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue drug1 and drug2 treatment . 
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of drug1 , alone or in combination with drug2 in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established . 
drug1 contains drug2 . 
drug1 has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of neurological and other complications in neonates and infants , which are sometimes fatal . 
Geriatric Use Younger patients have higher virologic response rates than older patients . 
Clinical studies of drug1 alone or in combination with drug2 did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 or over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects . 
Adverse reactions related to drug1 s , such as CNS , cardiac , and systemic ( eg , flu-like ) effects may be more severe in the elderly and caution should be exercised in the use of drug2 in this population . 
drug1 and drug2 are excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this therapy may be greater in patients with impaired renal function . 
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function . 
drug1 should be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min and drug2 should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min

General In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated no evidence of cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions that are likely to be of clinical relevance . 
drug1 / drug2 / drug3 / drug4 : Co-administration of drug5 with drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , and drug9 is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects . 
Specific studies have confirmed these effects with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
No pharmacokinetic interactions between drug1 and drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 have been demonstrated . 
However , due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions , when co-administered with drug1 , a reduction in dosage of drug2 on the concomitant drug3 , drug4 , drug5 or drug6 may be required . 
drug1 : In one study of 10 healthy volunteers , administration of drug2 for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of 1 ( one ) ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude or neuromuscular blockade associated with drug3 administration . 
Effect of other drugs on drug1 
In vitro studies : Studies in human liver microsomes showed that drug1 is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isoforms 3A4/5 , and to a lesser degree by CYP2C9 . 
Therefore , inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to reduce drug1 clearance . 
In vivo studies : Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors 
drug1 ( 400 mg b.i.d. ) had no effect on drug2 bioavailability ( AUC ) and maximum concentration ( Cmax ) of drug3 when co-administered with 20 mg drug4 in healthy volunteers . 
drug1 ( 500 mg t.i.d ) produced a 4-fold increase in drug2 AUC and a 3-fold increase in Cmax when co-administered with drug3 5 mg in healthy volunteers . 
It is recommended not to exceed a single 5 mg dose of drug1 in a 24-hour period when used in combination with drug2 . 
drug1 ( 200 mg once daily ) produced a 10-fold increase in drug2 AUC and a 4-fold increase in Cmax when co-administered with drug3 ( 5 mg ) in healthy volunteers . 
A 5-mg drug1 dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with 200 mg once daily drug2 . 
Since higher doses of drug1 ( 400 mg daily ) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC , a single 2.5 mg dose of drug2 should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with drug3 400 mg daily . 
drug1 : drug2 ( 800 mg t.i.d. ) co-administered with drug3 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in drug4 AUC , a 7-fold increase in drug5 Cmax and a 2-fold increase in drug6 half-life . 
It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg drug1 dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with drug2 . 
drug1 ( 600 mg b.i.d. ) co-administered with drug2 5 mg resulted in a 49-fold increase in drug3 AUC and a 13-fold increase in drug4 Cmax . 
The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of drug1 by drug2 , a highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , which also inhibits CYP2C9 . 
drug1 significantly prolonged the half-life of drug2 to 26 hours . 
Consequently , it is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg drug1 dose in a 72-hour period when used in combination with drug2 . 
Other Drug Interactions : No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between drug1 and the following drugs : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
In the drug1 study , drug2 had no effect on the prothrombin time or other pharmacodynamic parameters . 
Effects of drug1 on other drugs 
In vitro studies : drug1 and its metabolites had no effect on CYP1A2 , 2A6 , and 2E1 ( Ki 100uM ) . 
Weak inhibitory effects toward other isoforms ( CYP2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4 ) were found , but Ki values were in excess of plasma concentrations achieved following dosing . 
The most potent inhibitory activity was observed for vardenafil metabolite M1 , which had a Ki of 1.4 uM toward CYP3A4 , which is about 20 times higher than the M1 Cmax values after an 80 mg drug1 dose . 
In vivo studies : drug1 : The blood pressure lowering effects of sublingual drug2 ( 0.4 mg ) taken 1 and 4 hours after drug3 and increases in heart rate when taken at 1 , 4 and 8 hours were potentiated by a 20 mg dose of drug4 in healthy middle-aged subjects . 
These effects were not observed when drug1 20 mg was taken 24 hours before the drug2 . 
Potentiation of the hypotensive effects of drug1 for patients with ischemic heart disease has not been evaluated , and concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 is contraindicated . 
drug1 : drug2 20 mg , when co-administered with slow-release drug3 30 mg or 60 mg once daily , did not affect the relative bioavailability ( AUC ) or maximum concentration ( Cmax ) of drug4 , a drug that is metabolized via CYP3A4 . 
drug1 did not alter the plasma levels of drug2 when taken in combination . 
In these patients whose hypertension was controlled with drug1 , drug2 20 mg produced mean additional supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 6/5 mm Hg compared to placebo . 
drug1 : When drug2 10 or 20 mg was given to healthy volunteers either simultaneously or 6 hours after a 10 mg dose of drug3 , significant hypotension developed in a substantial number of subjects . 
With simultaneous dosing of drug1 10 mg and drug2 10 mg , 6 of 8 subjects experienced a standing systolic blood pressure of less than 85 mm Hg . 
With simultaneous dosing of drug1 20 mg and drug2 10 mg , 2 of 9 subjects experienced a standing systolic blood pressure of less than 85 mm Hg . 
When drug1 dosing was separated from drug2 10 mg by 6 hours , 7 of 28 subjects who received 20 mg of drug3 experienced a decrease in standing systolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg . 
In a similar study with drug1 in healthy volunteers , 1 of 24 subjects dosed with drug2 20 mg and drug3 0.4 mg separated by 6 hours experienced a standing systolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg . 
Two of 16 subjects dosed simultaneously with drug1 10 mg and drug2 0.4 mg experienced a standing systolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg . 
The administration of lower doses of drug1 with drug2 has not been completely evaluated to determine if they can be safely administered together . 
Based on these data , drug1 should not be used in patients on drug2 therapy . 
drug1 and drug2 : Upon concomitant administration of 5 mg of drug3 with 600 mg BID drug4 , the Cmax and AUC of drug5 were reduced by approximately 20 % . 
Upon administration of 10 mg of drug1 with 800 mg TID drug2 , the Cmax and AUC of drug3 were reduced by 40 % and 30 % , respectively . 
drug1 : drug2 ( 0.5 g/kg body weight : approximately 40 mL of absolute alcohol in a 70 kg person ) and drug3 plasma levels were not altered when dosed simultaneously . 
drug1 ( 20 mg ) did not potentiate the hypotensive effects of drug2 during the 4-hour observation period in healthy volunteers when administered with drug3 ( 0.5 g/kg body weight ) . 
drug1 : drug2 ( 10 mg and 20 mg ) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by drug3 ( two 81 mg tablets ) . 
Other interactions : drug1 had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of drug2 ( glucose and insulin concentrations ) and drug3 ( prothrombin time or other pharmacodynamic parameters ) . 
drug1 : When coadministered with drug2 , drug3 , a drug which increases gastrointestinal motility , lowers the serum concentration and urinary excretion of drug4 . 
Other drugs that increase gastrointestinal motility may produce similar effects . 
drug1 : drug2 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 when coadministered with drug4 . 
Co-administration of drug1 with drug2 has been shown to increase the mean half-life and the area under the concentration-time curve . 
Urinary excretion and renal clearance were correspondingly reduced . 
The clinical effects of this combination have not been studied . 
No reported interactions . 
Steady-state serum concentrations of drug1 are reported to fluctuate significantly when drug2 is either added or deleted from the drug regimen . 
Serious anticholinergic symptoms ( severe dry mouth , urinary retention , blurred vision ) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of drug1 when drug2 is added to the drug regimen . 
In addition , higher-than expected steady-state serum concentrations of drug1 have been observed when therapy is initiated in patients already taking drug2 . 
In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with drug1 , a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of drug2 may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued . 
The therapeutic efficacy of drug1 may be compromised in these patients when drug2 is discontinued . 
Several of the drug1 have been cited in these reports . 
There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other drug1 , including drug2 , when drug3 has been administered in combination with these agents . 
drug1 and its active metabolite , norfluoxe-tine , have long half-lives ( 4 to 16 days for drug2 ) , that may affect strategies during conversion from one drug to the other . 
Administration of drug1 during therapy with a drug2 has been shown to produce a stimulating effect in some depressed patients . 
Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dosage are required when drug1 is used with other drug2 or drug3 . 
The patient should be informed that the response to drug1 may be exaggerated . 
Drugs Metabolized by P450IID6 A subset ( 3 % to 10 % ) of the population has reduced activity of certain drug metabolizing enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme P450IID6 . 
Such individuals are referred to as poor metabolizers of drugs such as drug1 , drug2 , and the drug3 . 
These individuals may have higher than expected plasma concentrations of drug1 when given usual doses . 
In addition , certain drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme , including many drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , and others ) , may inhibit the activity of this isoenzyme , and thus may make normal metab-olizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system , leading to drug interactions . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug2 or the other drug . 
Therefore , co-administration of drug1 with other drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme , including other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ( eg , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 ) , or that inhibit this enzyme ( eg , drug9 ) , should be approached with caution . 
No drug interactions have been identified . 
Studies with drug1 in man , in animal models , and in vitro have shown no significant interference with the disposition of compounds metabolized by the hepatic microsomal enzymes , e.g. , cytochrome P450 system . 
Compounds tested in man include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 . 
drug1 as an index of hepatic drug extraction has been tested and no significant effects have been found . 
When administered concurrently , the following drugs may interact with drug1 : drug2 , general : exaggeration of the hypotension induced by general drug3 . 
drug1 ( oral agents and drug2 ) : hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia ; 
adjust dosage of drug1 accordingly . 
Catecholamine-depleting drugs ( e.g. , drug1 ) : additive effect ; 
monitor closely for evidence of hypotension and/or excessive bradycardia ( e.g. , vertigo , syncope , postural hypotension ) . 
Response to Treatment for Anaphylactic Reaction : While taking drug1 , patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of drug1 used to treat allergic reaction . 
Since drug1 ( drug2 ) may interact with concurrently administered drug3 , periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary ( eg , drug4 may elevate drug5 serum levels and drug6 has been reported to both increase and decrease drug7 levels ) . 
Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable drug1 given concurrently with drug2 may inhibit the desired drug3 -induced drop in colonic pH . 
Therefore , a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with drug1 . 
Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity increase the metabolism of drug1 and decrease its plasma concentrations . 
In patients receiving a potent CYP3A4 inducer such as drug1 or drug2 , a dose increase to 500 mg daily should be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction , and clinical response and adverse events should be carefully monitored ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics-Drug-Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-Dosage Adjustment sections ) . 
International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients taking drug1 while on drug2 therapy . 
Patients taking drug1 should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR . 
Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity ( eg , drug1 and drug2 ) decrease drug3 metabolism and increase drug4 plasma concentrations . 
This increase may be clinically relevant as adverse experiences are related to dose and exposure ; 
therefore , caution should be used when administering CYP3A4 inhibitors with drug1 . 
Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH ( drug1 such as drug2 or drug3 ) may reduce plasma concentrations of drug4 and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy . 
Phase II clinical trial data , where drug1 and drug2 have been used concomitantly , indicate that drug3 may exacerbate the neutropenic effect of drug4 . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 , drug3 s , drug4 ( allergy , cold , and sinus medicines ) , diabetic drugs , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 like drug8 or drug9 , and high blood pressure medications . 
No drug interactions of clinical importance have been identified . 
drug1 does not appear to affect the cytochrome P450-linked drug-metabolizing enzyme system . 
Compounds that have been tested in man include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 and no clinically meaningful interactions were found . 
Other concomitant therapy Although specific interaction studies were not performed , drug1 doses of 1 mg or more were concomitantly used in clinical studies with drug2 , drug3 , a-blockers , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , cardiac drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 ( also referred to as drug15 ) , and drug16 without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 had no effect on circulating levels of cortisol , thyroid-stimulating hormone , or thyroxine , nor did it affect the plasma lipid profile ( e.g. , total cholesterol , low-density lipoproteins , high-density lipoproteins and triglycerides ) or bone mineral density . 
In studies with drug1 , no clinically meaningful changes in luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) or prolactin were detected . 
In healthy volunteers , treatment with drug1 did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected . 
In clinical studies with drug1 ( drug2 , 1 mg ) in men 18-41 years of age , the mean value of serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12 . 
Further , in clinical studies with drug1 ( drug2 , 5 mg ) when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50 % . 
These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with drug1 . 
drug1 : Reports suggest that drug2 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug3 . 
In patients with mild to moderate hypertension , administration of 25 mg daily of drug1 with the drug2 drug3 , 10 to 40 mg for 4 weeks , was associated with an average increase in mean arterial pressure of about 3 mm Hg compared to drug4 alone . 
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of low-dose drug2 with drug3 may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications , compared to use of drug4 alone . 
In a 12-week endoscopy study conducted in OA patients there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of endoscopic gastroduodenal ulcers in patients taking low-dose ( 81 mg ) enteric coated drug1 plus drug2 25 mg daily , as compared to those taking drug3 2400 mg daily alone . 
Patients taking low-dose drug1 plus drug2 were not studied . 
At steady state , drug1 50 mg once daily had no effect on the anti-platelet activity of low-dose ( 81 mg once daily ) drug2 , as assessed by ex vivo platelet aggregation and serum TXB2 generation in clotting blood . 
Because of its lack of platelet effects , drug1 is not a substitute for drug2 for cardiovascular prophylaxis . 
Therefore , in patients taking drug1 , antiplatelet therapies should not be discontinued and should be considered in patients with an indication for cardiovascular prophylaxis . 
Prospective , long-term studies on concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 have not been conducted . 
drug1 : Co-administration with high doses of drug2 [800 mg twice daily ] increased the Cmax of drug3 by 21 % , the AUC0-120hr by 23 % and the t1/2 by 15 % . 
These small changes are not clinically significant and no dose adjustment is necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 75 mg once daily for 11 days does not alter the plasma concentration profile or renal elimination of drug3 after a single 0.5 mg oral dose . 
drug1 : Clinical studies , as well as post-marketing observations , have shown that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patients . 
This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
drug1 : drug2 400 mg daily did not have any clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 have produced an elevation of plasma drug3 levels and a reduction in renal drug4 clearance . 
In post-marketing experience there have been reports of increases in plasma drug1 levels . 
Thus , when drug1 and drug2 are administered concurrently , subjects should be observed carefully for signs of drug3 toxicity . 
drug1 drug2 12.5 , 25 , and 50 mg , each dose administered once daily for 7 days , had no effect on the plasma concentration of drug3 as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving single weekly drug4 doses of 7.5 to 20 mg for rheumatoid arthritis . 
At higher than recommended doses , drug1 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations by 23 % as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving drug2 7.5 to 15 mg/week for rheumatoid arthritis . 
At 24 hours postdose , a similar proportion of patients treated with drug1 alone ( 94 % ) and subsequently treated with drug2 co-administered with 75 mg of drug3 ( 88 % ) had drug4 plasma concentrations below the measurable limit ( 5 ng/mL ) . 
Standard monitoring of drug1 -related toxicity should be continued if drug2 and drug3 are administered concomitantly . 
Oral drug1 drug2 did not have any clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 and drug4 . 
drug1 / drug2 : drug3 did not have any clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug4 or drug5 . 
drug1 : Co-administration of drug2 with drug3 600 mg daily , a potent inducer of hepatic metabolism , produced an approximate 50 % decrease in drug4 plasma concentrations . 
Therefore , a starting daily dose of 25 mg of drug1 should be considered for the treatment of osteoarthritis when drug2 is co-administered with potent inducers of hepatic metabolism . 
drug1 drug2 12.5 , 25 , and 50 mg administered once daily for 7 days increased plasma drug3 concentrations ( AUC ( 0- ) ) by 38 to 60 % in healthy subjects administered a single 300-mg dose of drug4 . 
Adequate monitoring of drug1 plasma concentrations should be considered when therapy with drug2 is initiated or changed in patients receiving drug3 . 
These data suggest that drug1 may produce a modest inhibition of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A2 . 
Therefore , there is a potential for an interaction with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 1A2 ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 ) . 
drug1 : Anticoagulant activity should be monitored , particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing drug2 therapy in patients receiving drug3 or similar agents , since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
In single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects receiving both drug1 and drug2 , prothrombin time ( measured as INR ) was increased by approximately 8 % to 11 % . 
In post-marketing experience , bleeding events have been reported , predominantly in the elderly , in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving drug1 concurrently with drug2 . 
When administered concurrently , the following drugs may interact with drug1 . 
drug1 : Increased possibility of skin rash , particularly in hyperuricemic patients may occur . 
drug1 : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 may interfere with the bactericidal effect of drug6 . 
This has been demonstrated in view , however , the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented . 
Oral drug1 : May be less effective and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur . 
drug1 : May decrease renal tubular secretion of drug2 resulting in increased blood levels and/or drug3 toxicity . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction After treatment with drug1 , a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with drug2 tests ( Benedicts solution , Fehlings solution , or Clinitest tablets ) but not with enzyme based tests such as Clinistix and Glucose Enzymatic Test Strip USP . 
in vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that drug1 is unlikely to produce , or be subject to , pharmacokinetic interactions . 
drug1 and its major metabolite , at concentrations well above cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range , are neither inhibitors of nor high affinity substrates for human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms , epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes . 
In addition , drug1 does not affect the in vitro glucuronidation of drug2 . 
drug1 circulates largely unbound ( 10 % bound ) to plasma proteins ; 
clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely . 
Potential pharmacokinetic interactions were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies ( drug1 , drug2 , oral drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients . 
Drug-Drug Interactions Between drug1 And Other drug2 ( drug3 ) drug4 drug5 ( 3000 mg daily ) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of drug6 in patients with refractory epilepsy . 
Pharmacokinetics of drug1 were also not affected by drug2 . 
drug1 drug2 ( 1500 mg twice daily ) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug3 in healthy volunteers . 
drug1 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of drug2 absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion . 
There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite , ucb L057 . 
Potential drug interactions between drug1 and other drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and drug9 ) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of drug10 and these drug11 during placebo-controlled clinical studies . 
These data indicate that drug1 does not influence the plasma concentration of other drug2 and that these drug3 do not influence the pharmacokinetics of drug4 . 
Effect of drug1 in Pediatric Patients There was about a 22 % increase of apparent total body clearance of drug2 when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing drug3 . 
Dose adjustment is not recommended. drug1 had no effect on plasma concentrations of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
Other Drug Interactions Oral drug1 drug2 ( 500 mg twice daily ) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral drug3 containing 0.03 mg drug4 and 0.15 mg drug5 , or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels , indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely . 
Coadministration of this oral drug1 did not influence the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 drug2 ( 1000 mg twice daily ) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ( ECG ) of drug3 given as a 0.25 mg dose every day . 
Coadministration of drug1 did not influence the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 drug2 ( 1000 mg twice daily ) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of drug3 and drug4 . 
Prothrombin time was not affected by drug1 . 
Coadministration of drug1 did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 : drug2 , a renal tubular secretion blocking agent , administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day , did not change the pharmacokinetics of drug3 1000 mg twice daily . 
Cssmax of the metabolite , ucb L057 , was approximately doubled in the presence of drug1 while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same . 
Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of drug1 decreased 60 % , probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057 . 
The effect of drug1 on drug2 was not studied . 
drug1 or drug2 excess may decrease the effect of drug3 , and an drug4 deficiency can increase the effect of drug5 . 
Serum concentration of drug1 and drug2 may increase when patients take drug3 . 
A decrease of the dosage may be necessary when patient becomes euthyroid . 
drug1 may decrease thyroidal uptake of drug2 , a rebound in uptake may occur up to 5 days after sudden withdrawal of drug3 . 
Patients response to oral drug1 may be affected by his/her thyroid and metabolic status . 
An evaluation of prothrombin time and an adjustment of drug1 dosage are recommended 
No information available . 
Caution should be observed when drug1 is coadministered with other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 , as these agents may increase respiratory and circulatory depression . 
CNS-Active Drugs drug1 An additive effect on psychomotor performance was seen with coadministration of drug2 and drug3 0.70 g/kg for up to 4 hours after drug4 administration . 
drug1 : Coadministration of single doses of drug2 3 mg and drug3 20 mg daily for 7 days produced no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction . 
drug1 : Coadministration of single doses of drug2 3 mg and drug3 2 mg did not have clinically relevant effects on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of either drug . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 3 mg and drug3 10 mg produced a decrease in DSST scores . 
The interaction was pharmacodynamic ; 
there was no alteration in the pharmacokinetics of either drug . 
Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 ( drug1 ) CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of drug2 . 
The AUC of drug1 was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of drug2 , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , 400 mg daily for 5 days . 
Cmax and t1/2 were increased 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold , respectively . 
Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) would be expected to behave similarly . 
Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 ( drug1 ) Racemic drug2 exposure was decreased 80 % by concomitant useof drug3 , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 . 
A similar effect would be expected with drug1 . 
Drugs Highly Bound To Plasma Protein drug1 is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( 52-59 % bound ) ; 
therefore , the disposition of drug1 is not expected to be sensitive to alterations in protein binding . 
Administration of drug1 3 mg to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein-bound would not be expected to cause an alteration in the free concentration of either drug . 
Drugs With A Narrow Therapeutic Index drug1 A single dose of drug2 3 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 measured at steady state following dosing of 0.5 mg twice daily for one day and 0.25 mg daily for the next 6 days . 
drug1 : drug2 3 mg administered daily for 5 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 - or drug4 , nor were there any changes in the pharmacodynamic profile ( prothrombin time ) following a single 25 mg oral dose of drug5 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
Elevated plasma levels of drug1 have been reported with concomitant drug2 use . 
There have been reports of drug1 -related side effects in patients on concomitant therapy with drug2 and drug3 . 
Therefore , monitoring of drug1 plasma levels should be considered and dosage of drug2 adjusted as required . 
Elevated serum levels of drug1 have been reported with concomitant use of drug2 with drug3 . 
Therefore , drug1 serum levels should be monitored and appropriate drug2 dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly . 
drug1 , including drug2 , may enhance the effects of oral drug3 , including drug4 or its derivatives or similar agents . 
When these products are administered concomitantly , prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 including drug2 with drug3 ( a drug4 ) has , on rare occasions , resulted in severe hypoglycemia . 
Therefore , monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered . 
Diminished urinary excretion of drug1 has been reported during the concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 . 
The concomitant use of drug1 is not recommended since drug2 may antagonize the antibacterial effect of drug3 in the urinary tract . 
drug1 , or other products containing drug2 or drug3 , drug4 or drug5 should not be administered concomitantly with , or within 2 hours of , the administration of drug6 , because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of drug7 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be administered concomitantly with , or within 2 hours of , the administration of drug3 , because these products may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of drug4 . 
Some drug1 have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of drug2 . 
This may lead to reduced clearance of drug1 and a prolongation of its plasma half-life . 
No pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with drug1 . 
However , because drug1 is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes , and the drug is only about 80 % bound to plasma proteins at 4 C , drug interactions would not be expected to occur . 
drug1 Reports suggest that drug2 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug3 . 
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : The concomitant administration of drug2 has no apparent effect on the extent of absorption of drug3 . 
However , drug1 can decrease the peak concentration reached by 15 % to 20 % but have no detectable effect on the time-to-peak . 
drug1 : When drug2 is administered with drug3 , its protein binding is reduced , although the clearance of free drug4 is not altered . 
The clinical significance of this interaction is not known ; 
however , as with other drug1 , concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects . 
Cyclosporine , Digoxin , Methotrexate drug1 , like other drug2 , through effects on renal prostaglandins , may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and increased toxicity . 
Nephrotoxicity associated with drug1 may also be enhanced . 
Patients receiving these drugs who are given drug1 , or any other drug2 , and particularly those patients with altered renal function , should be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs . 
drug1 : Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with drug2 or drug3 . 
Nevertheless , clinical studies , as well as postmarketing observations have shown that drug1 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug2 and drug3 in some patients . 
This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
During concomitant therapy with drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure , as well as to assure diuretic efficacy . 
drug1 : drug2 has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 have produced an elevation of plasma drug3 levels and a reduction in renal drug4 clearance . 
The mean minimum drug1 concentration increased 15 % and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20 % . 
These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the drug1 . 
Thus , when drug1 and drug2 are administered concurrently , subjects should be observed carefully for signs of drug3 toxicity . 
drug1 : drug2 causes increase ( by about 80 % ) in the free fraction of drug3 . 
Although in vivo studies have not been done to see if drug1 clearance is changed by coadministration of drug2 , it is not recommended that they be coadministered . 
drug1 : drug2 has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with drug3 . 
drug1 : The effects of drug2 and drug3 on GI bleeding are synergistic , such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone . 
Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 capsules and tablets ) results in reduced protein binding of drug4 , but there was no change in the clearance of free drug5 . 
There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of drug1 administered alone and drug2 administered with drug3 as measured by prothrombin time . 
Thus , concomitant therapy with drug1 and drug2 should not require dosage adjustment of either drug . 
However , caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times , with or without bleeding , in drug1 -treated patients receiving concomitant drug2 therapy . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The urine of patients who take drug1 can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin ( urobilin ) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of drug2 . 
Diagnostic dip-stick methodology , used to detect ketone bodies in urine , has resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with drug1 . 
Generally , this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically significant events . 
No dose relationship has been observed . 
drug1 treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels . 
In clinical trials , mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic patients receiving drug1 ( 600 mg to 1000 mg/day ) after 4 weeks of therapy . 
These levels then remained stable for up to 1 year of therapy .

Drug-drug interactions with drug1 have not been explored in detail . 
There is one report of cardiopulmonary arrest , with full recovery , in a patient who was taking a drug1 ( drug2 ) . 
The effects of Mefloquineuine on the compromised cardiovascular system have not been evaluated . 
The benefits of drug1 therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease . 
Because of the danger of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval , drug1 must not be given simultaneously with or subsequent to drug2 . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 and other related compounds ( eg , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions . 
If these drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe malaria , drug1 administration should be delayed at least 12 hours after the last dose . 
There is evidence that the use of drug1 after Mefloquineuine causes a significant lengthening of the QTc interval . 
Clinically significant QTc prolongation has not been found with Mefloquineuine alone . 
This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with drug1 , although theoretically , coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction ( eg , drug2 or drug3 , drug4 , drug5 or drug6 , drug7 and drug8 ) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval . 
There are no data that conclusively establish whether the concomitant administration of Mefloquineuine and the above listed agents has an effect on cardiac function . 
In patients taking an drug1 ( eg , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 ) , the concomitant use of drug6 may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of the drug7 . 
Therefore , patients concurrently taking antiseizure medication and drug1 should have the blood level of their antiseizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted appropriately . 
When drug1 is taken concurrently with oral drug2 , attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded . 
Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of drug1 .

drug1 should not be mixed with infusion solutions until clinical data are available to direct this use . 
When drug1 and drug2 are used together , the signs of atropinization ( flushing , mydriasis , tachycardia , dryness of the mouth and nose ) may occur earlier than might be expected than when drug3 is used alone because drug4 may potentiate the effect of drug5 . 
The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning although they do not bear directly on the use of drug1 and drug2 . 
Since drug1 are potentiated by the drug2 , they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions . 
Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 : The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 ( debrisoquin hydroxylase ) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population ( about 7-10 % of Caucasians are so-called poor metabolizers ) ; 
reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian , African and other populations are not yet available . 
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of drug1 ( drug2 ) when given usual doses . 
Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large ( 8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA ) . 
In addition , certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers . 
An individual who is stable on a given dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy . 
The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme ( drug1 ; 
drug1 ) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 ( many other drug2 , drug3 , and the drug4 drug5 and drug6 ) . 
While all the drug1 ( drug2 ) , e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 , inhibit P450 2D6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
The extent to which drug1 - drug2 interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug3 involved . 
Nevertheless , caution is indicated in the co-administration of drug1 with any of the drug2 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
Of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from drug1 , given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite ( at least 5 weeks may be necessary ) . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug2 or the other drug . 
Furthermore , whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy , an increased dose of drug1 may be required . 
It is desirable to monitor drug1 plasma levels whenever a drug2 is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 . 
drug1 is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 ( with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as minor pathways ) . 
Inhibitors or substrates of CYP2D6 ( i.e. , drug1 , drug2 [ drug3 ] ) may increase the plasma concentration of drug4 when administered concomitantly . 
The extent of interaction depends on the variability of effect on CYP2D6 . 
The clinical significance of this interaction with drug1 has not been systematically evaluated . 
drug1 : Serious side effects and even death have been reported following the concomitant use of certain drugs with drug2 .

Serious anticholinergic symptoms ( i.e. , severe dry mouth , urinary retention and blurred vision ) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of drug1 when drug2 therapy is initiated . 
Additionally , higher than expected drug1 levels have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking drug2 . 
In patients who have been reported to be well controlled on drug1 receiving concurrent drug2 therapy , discontinuation of drug3 has been reported to decrease established steady-state serum drug4 levels and compromise their therapeutic effects . 
drug1 : It should be borne in mind that drug2 ingestion may increase the danger inherent in any intentional or unintentional drug3 overdosage . 
This is especially important in patients who may use drug1 excessively . 
drug1 : A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on drug2 ( 1 gm/day ) 11 days after the addition of drug3 ( 75 mg/day ) .

Caution , however , is advised in patients taking drug1 which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines . 
An additive hypotensive effect has been reported with the combination of systemic drug1 and drug2 therapy . 
Systemic drug1 may inhibit the production of catecholamines in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia . 
Since drug1 may reduce pulse and blood pressure , caution in using drugs such as drug2 ( ophthalmic and systemic ) , drug3 , and drug4 is advised . 
Patients using cardiovascular drugs concurrently with drug1 0.5 % Ophthalmic Solution should have pulse and blood pressures frequently monitored . 
Caution should be exercised with simultaneous use of drug1 and other similar pharmacologic agents

Drug Interaction During Pregnancy : drug1 and drug2 were studied following subcutaneous injections in pregnant mice . 
drug1 alone in doses up to 540 mg/kg/day ( approximately 340 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis ) did not cause significant increases in resorptions or major malformations . 
drug1 alone at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg/day ( approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis ) increased both resorptions and malformations . 
The addition of 540 mg/kg/day of drug1 ( approximately 340 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis ) to 2.7 mg/kg/day of drug2 ( approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis ) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations . 
LABORATORY TEST FINDINGS Asymptomatic , transitory changes in serum iron have been observed . 
The clinical significance is unknown . 
drug1 interferes with serum calcium measurements with some colorimetric ( complexometric ) methods commonly used in hospitals , resulting in serum calcium concentrations lower than the true values .

If such measurements are necessary , the use of other methods is recommended . 
All patients in whom this effect was observed remained asymptomatic . 
drug1 may increase the ototoxic potential of drug2 , especially in the presence of impaired renal function . 
Except in life-threatening situations , avoid this combination . 
drug1 should not be used concomitantly with drug2 because of the possibility of ototoxicity . 
Patients receiving high doses of drug1 concomitantly with drug2 , as in rheumatic disease , may experience drug3 toxicity at lower doses because of competitive renal excretory sites .

Use with drug1 : The use of drug2 to control hypertension in patients on drug3 has been reported to induce severe leukopenia . 
Interaction with drug1 other than drug2 has not been specifically studied ; 
however , no deleterious interactions were seen when drug1 was administered after drug2 , inhalational drug3 , drug4 and muscle relaxant antagonists administered in conjunction with sedation or anesthesia . 
Particular caution is necessary when using drug1 in cases of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effects ( such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias ) of other drugs taken in overdose ( especially drug2 ) may emerge with the reversal of the drug3 effect by drug4 . 
The use of drug1 is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period . 
Although drug1 exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect , its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a drug2 agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic patients .

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : drug1 can cause a significant elevation in plasma drug2 levels . 
This increase is greatest in the evening . 
drug1 may interfere with urinary steroid determinations . 
drug1 is metabolized mainly via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme .

drug1 : In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that drug2 , drug3 , and oral drug4 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug5 , which can result in an increase in plasma drug6 levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG . 
Human pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral drug1 markedly inhibits the metabolism of drug2 , resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of drug3 . 
A study in 14 normal male and female volunteers suggests that coadministration of drug1 and drug2 can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG . 
drug1 : drug2 coadministration leads to an increased peak plasma concentration and AUC of drug3 , there is no effect on drug4 absorption when it is coadministered with drug5 . 
The gastrointestinal absorption of drug1 and drug2 is accelerated when they are coadministered with drug3 . 
drug1 : In vitro data indicate that drug2 and drug3 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug4 which can result in an increase in plasma drug5 levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG . 
Other : Coadministration of grapefruit juice with drug1 increases the bioavailability of drug2 and concomitant use should be avoided . 
drug1 should not be used concomitantly with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval : certain drug2 , including those of Class IA ( such as drug3 and drug4 ) and Class III ( such as drug5 ) ; 
drug1 ( such as drug2 ) ; 
certain drug1 ( such as drug2 ) ; 
certain drug1 ( such as drug2 ) ; 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
The preceding lists of drugs are not comprehensive . 
The acceleration of gastric emptying by drug1 could affect the rate of absorption of other drugs . 
Patients receiving narrow therapeutic ratio drugs or other drugs that require careful titration should be followed closely ; 
if plasma levels are being monitored , they should be reassessed . 
The risks of using drug1 in combination with other drugs have not been systematically evaluated . 
Given the primary CNS effects of drug1 , caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs . 
drug1 should not be used with drug2 . 
Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when drug1 is administered with drug2 or drug3 . 
Several drug1 have been reported to block the pharmacologic effects of drug2 , drug3 , or similar agents , and such an effect may be anticipated with drug4 because of its structural similarity to other drug5 . 
The plasma concentration of drug1 has been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of drug2 ; 
plasma levels of several closely related drug1 have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of drug2 or hepatic enzyme inhibitors ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 ) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers ( e.g. , drug5 , drug6 ) , and such an effect may be anticipated with drug7 as well . 
Administration of drug1 has been reported to increase the plasma levels of drug2 , if given concomitantly . 
Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 : The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 ( debrisoquin hydroxylase ) is reduced in a subset of the aucasian population ( about 7 % -10 % of Caucasians are so-called poor metabolizers ) ; 
reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian , African and other populations are not yet available . 
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected lasma concentrations of drug1 ( drug2 ) when given usual doses . 
Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large ( 8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the drug1 ) . 
In addition , certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers . 
An individual who is stable on a given dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy . 
The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme ( drug1 ; 
drug1 ) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 ( many other drug2 , drug3 , and the drug4 drug5 and drug6 ) . 
While all the drug1 ( drug2 ) , e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 , inhibit P450 2D6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
drug1 has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2 , an isoform also involved in drug2 metabolism . 
The extent to which drug1 - drug2 interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug3 involved . 
Nevertheless , caution is indicated in the co-administration of drug1 with any of the drug2 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
Of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiating drug1 treatment in a patient being withdrawn from drug2 , given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite ( at least 5 weeks may be necessary ) . 
Concomitant use of agents in the drug1 ( which includes drug2 ) with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug3 or the other drug . 
Furthermore , whenever one of these drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy , an increased dose of drug1 may be required . 
It is desirable to monitor drug1 plasma levels whenever an agent of the drug2 including drug3 is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 ( and/or P450 1A2 ) . 
Because drug1 is highly bound to serum protein , the administration of drug2 to patients taking other drugs that are highly bound to protein ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 ) may cause an increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs , potentially resulting in adverse effects . 
Conversely , adverse effects may result from displacement of protein-bound drug1 by other highly bound drugs . 
No trials specifically examining potential drug interactions with drug1 were conducted , although many concomitant drugs were used in clinical trials . 
No drug interactions were detected except for an increase in symptomatic hypotension in patients receiving oral drug1 . 
The co-administration of drug1 with IV drug2 such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or IV drug6 has not been evaluated ( these drugs were not co-administered with drug7 in clinical trials ) . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 or other drug3 , causing increased sedative effects . 
It may also interact with drug1 or other drug2 or drug3 , which may intensify the anticholinergic action . 
drug1 can interact with drug2 , increasing the metabolism of drug3 . 
Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when drug1 is administered with drug2 , drug3 , or other drug4 . 
When other drug1 or drug2 are used concomitantly , there is the potential for drug3 to increase the risk of bleeding . 
However , patients receiving infusions of drug1 in clinical trials were maintained on drug2 without evidence of increased bleeding . 
In clinical trials , drug1 was used with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , oral drug5 , and supplemental drug6 .In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving drug7 or drug8 in whom therapy with drug9 was initiated , apparent oral clearance values for drug10 ( n = 23 ) and drug11 ( n = 30 ) were decreased by 13 % and 15 % , respectively , on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87 . 
The change in drug1 clearance value is not likely to be clinically significant . 
However , patients on drug1 may show elevations of drug2 concentrations after initiation of therapy with drug3 , which may be clinically significant in patients prone to drug4 toxicity . 
Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drug1 . 
However , the systemic administration of some drug1 has been shown to elevate plasma concentrations of drug2 , interfere with the metabolism of drug3 , and enhance the effects of the oral drug4 drug5 and its derivatives , and has been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving systemic drug6 concomitantly . 
No drug , nutritional supplement , food or herb interactions are known . 
Before using this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist of all prescription and nonprescription products you may use , especially of : drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 ) , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 drugs ( e.g. , drug7 ) , drug8 , drug9 . 
Do not start or stop any medicine without doctor or pharmacist approval . 
The hypoglycemic action of drug1 may be potentiated by certain drugs including drug2 and other drugs that are highly protein bound , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , and drug9 . 
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia . 
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for loss of control . 
Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control . 
These drugs include the drug1 and other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , thyroid products , drug5 , oral drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 . 
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be closely observed for loss of control . 
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia . 
Since animal studies suggest that the action of drug1 may be prolonged by therapy with drug2 , drug3 should be employed with caution . 
In some patients , a drug1 -like reaction may be produced by the ingestion of drug2 . 
A potential interaction between oral drug1 and oral drug2 leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported . 
Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous , topical , or vaginal preparations of drug1 is not known . 
Concurrent use of drug1 with drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 ) may result in increased drug7 effects . 
When used concurrently with such drugs , the dose of drug1 should be the smallest effective dose and the frequency of dosing reduced as much as possible when administered concomitantly with drugs that potentiate the action of drug2 . 
In healthy volunteers , the pharmacokinetics of a 1-mg dose of drug1 administered as drug2 were not affected by the coadministration of a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose of drug3 . 
However , in another study in healthy volunteers , the pharmacokinetics of drug1 were significantly altered ( 29 % decrease in AUC and 38 % decrease in Cmax ) when a 1-mg dose of drug2 was administered 1 minute after a 20-mg dose of drug3 nasal spray . 
( The two drugs were administered in opposite nostrils . ) 
When the drug1 was administered 30 minutes after the drug2 nasal spray , the AUC of drug3 increased 11 % and Cmax decreased 18 % . 
In neither case were the pharmacokinetics of drug1 affected by coadministration with drug2 . 
These results suggest that the analgesic effect of drug1 may be diminished when it is administered shortly after drug2 nasal spray , but by 30 minutes any such reduction in effect should be minimal . 
The safety of using drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) Nasal Spray during the same episode of migraine has not been established . 
However , it should be noted that both products are capable of producing transient increases in blood pressure . 
The pharmacokinetics of a 1-mg dose of drug1 administered as drug2 were not affected by the coadministration of drug3 ( 300 mg QID ) . 
Conversely , the administration of drug1 ( 1 mg drug2 QID ) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a 300-mg dose of drug3 . 
It is not known if the effects of drug1 are altered by concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs ( drug2 , etc. ) , but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed . 
The fraction of drug1 absorbed is unaffected by the concomitant administration of a drug2 ( drug3 ) , but the rate of absorption is decreased . 
Therefore , a slower onset can be anticipated if drug1 is administered concomitantly with , or immediately following , a drug2 . 
No information is available about the use of drug1 concurrently with drug2 . 
drug1 should be used cautiously in patients with hyperthyroidism , hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias . 
All drug1 should be used cautiously in patients taking drug2 . 
drug1 should not be administered concomitantly with other drug2 ( such as drug3 ) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity . 
Combined effects may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias . 
They may be administered alternately when the preceding effect of other such drug has subsided . 
Administration of drug1 to patients receiving drug2 or drug3 such as drug4 which sensitize the myocardium , may induce cardiac arrhythmia . . 
When encountered , such arrhythmias may respond to administration of a drug1 . 
drug1 also should be used cautiously with other drugs ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 ) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of drug4 . 
drug1 may decrease vascular response to pressor drugs such as drug2 . 
drug1 may antagonize the neuron blockade produced by drug2 resulting in decreased antihypertensive effect and requiring increased dosage of the latter . 
May interact drug1 ( altered hypo-prothrombinemic effect ) , drug2 , drug3 and other inducers of hepatic microsomal enzyme oxidation system ( decreased effect of drug4 ) , drug5 ( increased effect of drug6 ) . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 is not recommended because drug4 is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of drug5 , resulting in lower plasma concentrations , peak plasma levels , and AUC values . 
drug1 : While studies have not shown drug2 to interact with drug3 , caution should be exercised , nonetheless , since interactions have been seen with other drug4 . 
Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis , and drug1 affect platelet function as well , concurrent therapy with all drug2 , including drug3 , and drug4 requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their drug5 dosage is required . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 : drug4 , like other drug5 , may affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of certain drugs . 
Ingestion of drug1 may increase serum concentrations of drug2 and drug3 and increase drug4 s nephrotoxicity . 
Patients who begin taking drug1 or who increase their drug2 dose or any other drug3 while taking drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs . 
They should be observed closely , particularly if renal function is impaired . 
In the case of drug1 , serum levels should be monitored . 
drug1 : drug2 decreases drug3 renal clearance and increases drug4 plasma levels . 
In patients taking drug1 and drug2 concomitantly , drug3 toxicity may develop . 
Oral drug1 : drug2 does not alter glucose metabolism in normal subjects nor does it alter the effects of oral drug3 . 
There are rare reports , however , from marketing experiences , of changes in effects of drug1 or oral drug2 in the presence of drug3 that necessitated changes in the doses of such agents . 
Both hypo- and hyperglycemic effects have been reported . 
A direct causal relationship has not been established , but physicians should consider the possibility that drug1 may alter a diabetic patient s response to drug2 or oral drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 and other drug3 can inhibit the activity of drug4 . 
Concomitant treatment with drug1 may be associated with increased serum potassium levels . 
Other Drugs : In small groups of patients ( 7-10/interaction study ) , the concomitant administration of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or drug7 did not significantly affect the peak levels and AUC values of drug8 . 
drug1 toxicity has been reported to have occurred in a patient on chronic drug2 treatment following the initiation of drug3 therapy . 
Protein Binding In vitro , drug1 interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of drug2 ( 20 % decrease in binding ) , drug3 , drug4 ( 10 % decrease in binding ) , or drug5 . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 have no influence in vitro on the protein binding of drug9 in human serum . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Effect on Blood Coagulation : drug1 increases platelet aggregation time but does not affect bleeding time , plasma thrombin clotting time , plasma fibrinogen , or factors V and VII to XII . 
Statistically significant changes in prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times have been reported in normal volunteers . 
The mean changes were observed to be less than 1 second in both instances , however , and are unlikely to be clinically important . 
drug1 is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor , however , and all drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis interfere with platelet function to some degree ; 
therefore , patients who may be adversely affected by such an action should be carefully observed . 
Certain other drug1 ( drug2 and drug3 ) have also been reported to interfere with the nerve transmission at the neuromuscular junction . 
Based on this reported activity , they should not be given concomitantly with drug1 Parenteral except with the greatest caution . 
drug1 ( eg , drug2 ) and other drugs , including ether , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 , potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with drug7 Parenteral . 
drug1 may enhance the nephrotoxicity of drug2 Parenteral . 
The concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 Parenteral should be avoided . 
Antiacid , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , Indanavir , drug5 , drug6 , Phenobarbitol , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , Ritanovir , drug10 . 
Although drug1 used alone has little or no effect on pupil size , mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with drug2 and drug3 may occur . 
Close observation of the patient is recommended when a drug1 is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as drug2 , because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope or postural hypotension . 
Patients receiving drug1 along with either oral or intravenous drug2 should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances , left ventricular failure and hypotension . 
In patients with impaired cardiac function , simultaneous use should be avoided altogether . 
The concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 and drug3 s may have additive effects on prolonging atrioventricular conduction time . 
drug1 and drug2 may have additive hypotensite effects due to the inhibition of each other s metabolism . 
drug1 : concurrent use may blunt the response to drug2 . 
drug1 should be withdrawn at least 48 hours before conducting an drug2 -mediated stress test . 
drug1 ( such as drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 ) : concurrent use with drug5 may have a proarrhythmic effect . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) , drug3 or other drug4 , or drug5 : concurrent use with drug6 may produce additive inotropic and/or chronotropic effects . 
Other drug1 ( e.g. drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and general drug5 ) have additive or potentiating effects with drug6 . 
When patients have received such drugs , the dose of drug1 required will be less than usual . 
Following the administration of drug1 , the dose of other drug2 should be reduced . 
There are no known drug/drug interactions with drug1 . 
drug1 has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other drug2 . 
Therefore , it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents . 
Antagonism has been demonstrated between drug1 and drug2 in vitro . 
Because of possible clinical significance , these two drugs should not be administered concurrently . 
Interactions with Other CNS Agents : Concurrent use of drug1 with all drug2 ( eg , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , other drug6 , general drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 and drug13 ) may result in additive central nervous system depressant effects . 
Respiratory depression , hypotension , and profound sedation or coma may occur . 
When such combined therapy is contemplated , the dose of one or both agents should be reduced . 
Although no interaction between drug1 and drug2 has been observed , it is not recommended for use with drug3 . 
Most cases of serious or fatal adverse events involving drug1 reported to the manufacturer or the FDA have involved either the administration of large initial doses or too frequent doses of the drug to nonopioid tolerant patients , or the simultaneous administration of drug2 with other drugs affecting respiration . 
The initial dose of drug1 should be reduced by approximately 50 % or more when it is given to patients along with another drug affecting respiration . 
Interactions with drug1 : drug2 ( eg , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 and drug7 ) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a drug8 such as drug9 . 
In drug1 -dependent patients , drug2 may precipitate withdrawal symptoms . 
drug1 ( 10 mg once daily ) has been coadministered with therapeutic doses of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 in controlled clinical pharmacology studies in adult volunteers . 
Although increased plasma concentrations ( AUC 0-24 hrs ) of drug1 and/or drug2 were observed following coadministration of drug3 with each of these drugs in normal volunteers ( n = 24 in each study ) , there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of drug4 , as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters , clinical laboratory tests , vital signs , and adverse events . 
There were no significant effects on QTc intervals , and no reports of sedation or syncope . 
No effects on plasma concentrations of drug1 or drug2 were observed . 
Plasma concentrations ( AUC 0-24 hrs ) of drug1 decreased 15 % with coadministration of drug2 relative to that observed with drug3 alone . 
The clinical relevance of this difference is unknown . 
These above findings are summarized in TABLE 1 . 
TABLE 1 Effects on Plasma Concentrations ( AUC 0-24 hrs ) of drug1 and drug2 After 10 Days of Coadministration ( drug3 10 mg ) in Normal Volunteers 
drug1 drug2 
drug1 ( 500 mg q8h ) + 40 % +46 % 
drug1 ( 300 mg qid ) +103 % + 6 % 
drug1 ( 200 mg q12h ) +307 % +73 % 
There does not appear to be an increase in adverse events in subjects who received oral drug1 and drug2 . 
No drug interactions have been reported . 
drug1 : drug2 is known to interact with the metabolism or renal tubular excretion of many drugs ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 agents , drug15 , and drug16 ) . 
Concomitant medications should be carefully assessed . 
drug1 should either be temporarily discontinued or decreased by 50 % when coadministered with drug2 on the day of drug3 infusion . 
Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of drug1 and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g. , intravenous drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) , drug6 , drug7 , intravenous drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 ] is contraindicated . 
Such agents must be discontinued at least seven days prior to starting therapy with drug1 . 
drug1 , a drug2 , may antagonize the bactericidal effect of drug3 and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided . 
The concomitant use of drug1 or other drug2 may have an additive effect . 
drug1 : There is no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between drug2 and drug3 which has been confirmed clinically . 
drug1 also has no significant effect on the intracellular phosphorylation of drug2 , as shown in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in two other cell lines ( U937 and Molt-4 ) . 
In the same study it was shown that drug1 and drug2 had no significant effect on the intracellular phosphorylation of drug3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells . 
drug1 : In vitro studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , U937 and Molt-4 cells revealed that drug2 significantly inhibited drug3 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner . 
Effects were already seen with doses corresponding to relevant plasma levels in humans , and the intracellular phosphorylation of drug1 to its three metabolites ( including the active zalcitabine triphosphate metabolite ) was significantly inhibited . 
drug1 inhibited drug2 phosphorylation at high concentration ratios ( 10 and 100 ) ; 
however , it is considered to be unlikely that this decrease of phosphorylated drug1 concentration is of clinical significance , as drug2 is a more efficient substrate for deoxycytidine kinase than drug3 . 
These in vitro studies suggest that concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 in humans may result in sub-therapeutic concentrations of active phosphorylated drug3 , which may lead to a decreased drug4 effect of drug5 . 
It is unknown how the effect seen in these in vitro studies translates into clinical consequences . 
Concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 is not recommended . 
drug1 : The combination of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 has been studied ( as triple combination ) in adults . 
Pharmacokinetic data suggest that absorption , metabolism , and elimination of each of these drugs are unchanged when they are used together . 
Drugs Associated With Peripheral Neuropathy : The concomitant use of drug1 with drugs that have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy should be avoided where possible . 
Drugs that have been associated with peripheral neuropathy include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , and drug16 . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 is not recommended . 
Intravenous drug1 : Treatment with drug2 should be interrupted when the use of a drug that has the potential to cause pancreatitis is required . 
Death due to fulminant pancreatitis possibly related to intravenous drug1 and drug2 has been reported . 
If intravenous drug1 is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , treatment with drug2 should be interrupted . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 : Drugs such as drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 may increase the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy or other drug7 -associated adverse events by interfering with the renal clearance of drug8 ( thereby raising systemic exposure ) . 
Patients who require the use of one of these drugs with drug1 should have frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring with dosage adjustment for any significant change in renal function . 
drug1 or drug2 : Concomitant administration of drug3 or drug4 decreases the elimination of drug5 , most likely by inhibition of renal tubular secretion of drug6 . 
Patients receiving these drugs in combination with drug1 should be monitored for signs of toxicity and the dose of drug2 reduced if warranted . 
drug1 / drug2 -containing drug3 : Absorption of drug4 is moderately reduced ( approximately 25 % ) when coadministered with drug5 / drug6 -containing drug7 . 
The clinical significance of this reduction is not known , hence drug1 is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with drug2 / drug3 -containing drug4 . 
drug1 : Bioavailability is mildly reduced ( approximately 10 % ) when drug2 and drug3 are coadministered . 
drug1 : drug2 caused a decrease in drug3 phosphorylation ( 50 % inhibition of total phosphate formation ) in U937/Molt 4 cells . 
Although there may be decreased drug1 activity because of lessened active metabolite formation , the clinical relevance of these in vitro results are not known . 
No Information Provided 
drug1 may add to or potentiate the action of other drug2 . 
Potentiation occurs with drug1 . 
Medication such as drug1 may also influence serum electrolytes . 
Warning signs , irrespective of cause , are : dryness of mouth , thirst , weakness , lethargy , drowsiness , restlessness , muscle pains or cramps , muscular fatigue , hypotension , oliguria , tachycardia , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting . 
drug1 requirements in diabetic patients may be increased , decreased , or unchanged . 
Higher dosage of oral drug1 may be required . 
Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during drug1 administration . 
drug1 and related drugs may increase the responsiveness to drug2 . 
drug1 and related drugs may decrease arterial responsiveness to drug2 . 
This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use . 
In vitro studies have shown drug1 can displace drug2 s , such as drug3 , from their protein-binding sites . 
It is recommended that if drug1 is started in patients already receiving drug2 , prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the drug3 dose may be necessary . 
Prior administration of drug1 has no clinically important effect on the neuromuscular blocking action of drug2 . 
The use of drug1 before drug2 to attenuate some of the side effects of drug3 has not been studied . 
There are no clinical data on concomitant use of drug1 and other nondepolarizing drug2 . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 decrease the ED50 of drug4 by 30 % to 45 % . 
These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action by up to 25 % . 
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as drug1 include certain drug2 ( e. g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 ) , drug11 salts , drug12 , local drug13 , drug14 , and drug15 . 
As with some other drug1 , the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by drug2 is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving drug3 or drug4 . 
Oils may enhance absorption . 
Therefore , simultaneous use of creams , ointments or oils should be avoided . 
Inhibitors of CYP2D6 ; 
poor metabolizers of drug1 : Interactions of drug2 with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 ( such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 ) have not been studied , but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R ( + ) enantiomer of drug7 . 
Retrospective analysis of side effects in clinical trials showed that poor 2D6 metabolizers had a higher rate of dizziness during up-titration , presumably resulting from vasodilating effects of the higher concentrations of the a-blocking R ( + ) enantiomer . 
Catecholamine-depleting Agents : Patients taking both drug1 and a drug that can deplete catecholamines ( e.g. , drug2 and drug3 ) should be observed closely for signs of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 may potentiate blood-pressure- and heart-rate-lowering effects . 
When concomitant treatment with drug1 and drug2 is to be terminated , the drug3 should be discontinued first . 
drug1 therapy can then be discontinued several days later by gradually decreasing the dosage . 
drug1 : Modest increases in mean trough drug2 concentrations were observed following initiation of drug3 treatment in 21 renal transplant patients suffering from chronic vascular rejection . 
In about 30 % of patients , the dose of drug1 had to be reduced in order to maintain drug2 concentrations within the therapeutic range , while in the remainder no adjustment was needed . 
On the average for the group , the dose of drug1 was reduced about 20 % in these patients . 
Due to wide interindividual variability in the dose adjustment required , it is recommended that drug1 concentrations be monitored closely after initiation of drug2 therapy and that the dose of drug3 be adjusted as appropriate . 
drug1 : drug2 concentrations are increased by about 15 % when drug3 and drug4 are administered concomitantly . 
Both drug1 and drug2 slow AV conduction . 
Therefore , increased monitoring of drug1 is recommended when initiating , adjusting , or discontinuing drug2 . 
Inducers and Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism : drug1 reduced plasma concentrations of drug2 by about 70 % . 
drug1 increased AUC by about 30 % but caused no change in Cmax . 
drug1 : Isolated cases of conduction disturbance ( rarely with hemodynamic compromise ) have been observed when drug2 is co-administered with drug3 . 
As with other drug1 , if drug2 is to be administered orally with drug3 of the drug4 or drug5 type , it is recommended that ECG and blood pressure be monitored . 
drug1 or Oral drug2 : drug3 may enhance the blood-sugar-reducing effect of drug4 and oral drug5 . 
Therefore , in patients taking drug1 or oral drug2 , regular monitoring of blood glucose is recommended . 
drug1 is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes , 3A4 and 2B6 . 
drug1 is known to be an inducer of these enzymes . 
As a result , drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when coadministered with drug1 . 
The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of drug1 and other drugs are listed in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Table 1 . 
Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on these pharmacokinetic changes are listed in Table 3 . 
The data inTables 1 and 3 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated . 
In addition to established drug interactions , there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between drug1 and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system . 
These potential drug interactions are listed in Table 4 . 
Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for the classes of drugs listed in Table 4 , additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs . 
The in vitro interaction between drug1 and the drug2 drug3 is complex . 
As a result , when giving these drugs concomitantly , plasma drug1 levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time . 
When drug1 is co-administered with drug2 , anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently .

Potential effect on anticoagulation . 
Monitoring of anticoagulation levels is recommended . 
Fat redistribution : Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and cushingoid appearance have been observed in patients receiving drug1 therapy . 
The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown . 
A causal relationship has not been established

fucking empty sentence 
Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation , with or without drug1 replacement , may alter the pharmacokinetics of certain concomitant medications , such as drug2 and drug3 . 
Doses of these and perhaps other medications may need to be adjusted in patients who successfully quit smoking . 
The risk of using drug1 in combination with other drugs has not been systematically evaluated , but drug2 may potentiate the side effects of drug3 . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 , drug3 , and certain other agents . 
Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of drug1 : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 is not recommended . 
Drug-Drug Interactions : The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug1 and other drug2 have not been determined . 
However , interactions may be expected , and drug1 should NOT be used in combination with other drug2 . 
Animal studies indicate that drug1 may be ineffective if the patient has recently received a drug2 . 
In such a case , the peripheral vascular resistance may increase . 
Preliminary studies indicate that the concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 results in a higher cardiac output and , usually , a lower pulmonary wedge pressure than when either drug is used alone . 
There was no evidence of drug interactions in clinical studies in which drug1 was administered concurrently with other drugs , including drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , and drug14 . 
No drug-drug interaction studies in human subjects have been conducted . 
Toxicologic and toxicokinetic studies in rats did not demonstrate any alterations in the clearance or toxicologic profile of either drug1 or drug2 when the two agents were administered together . 
In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent drug1 and drug2 therapy , a 7 % rate of serious infections was observed , which was higher than that observed with drug3 alone ( 0 % ) . 
Two percent of patients treated concurrently with drug1 and drug2 developed neutropenia ( ANC 1 x 109/L ) . 
drug1 containing drug2 , when administered concomitantly with drug3 , reduce both the rate and extent of absorption . 
The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of drug1 onto the surface of drug2 . 
drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , can inhibit renal tubular secretion of drug4 . 
The resulting increase in drug1 serum levels may increase toxicity , and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract drug2 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions As a result of the presence of drug1 , a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur . 
This has been observed with Benedict s and Fehling s solutions but not with the glucose enzymatic test . 
In evaluating the potential for interactions among co-administered antiepilepsy drugs ( drug1 ) , whether or not an drug2 induces or does not induce metabolic enzymes is an important consideration . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 are ge nerally classified as enzyme inducers ; 
drug1 and drug2 are not . 
drug1 is considered to be a non-enzyme inducing drug2 . 
The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from studies involving either healthy subjects or patients with epilepsy . 
Effects of drug1 on other Antiepilepsy Drugs ( drug2 ) : drug3 : drug4 had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of drug5 in patients with epilepsy . 
drug1 : drug2 had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of drug3 or its epoxide metabolite in patients with epilepsy . 
drug1 : drug2 causes a slight decrease ( about 10 % ) in steady-state drug3 concentrations . 
drug1 or drug2 : No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been performed examining the addition of drug3 to regimens containing drug4 or drug5 . 
The addition of drug1 in a limited number of patients in three well-controlled studies caused no systematic changes in drug2 or drug3 concentrations when compared to placebo . 
Effects of other Antiepilepsy Drugs ( drug1 ) on drug2 : drug3 : Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that drug4 clearance is 60 % greater in patients taking drug5 with or without other enzyme- inducing drug6 . 
drug1 : Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that drug2 clearance is 60 % greater in patients taking drug3 with or without other enzyme- inducing drug4 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that drug3 clearance is 60 % greater in patients taking drug4 ( drug5 ) with or without other enzyme-inducing drug6 . 
drug1 : The addition of drug2 to patients taking drug3 chronically had no effect on drug4 pharmacokinetics , but drug5 significantly decreased drug6 binding in vitro from 96.3 to 94.8 % , which resulted in an increase of approximately 40 % in the free tiagabine concentration . 
The clinical relevance of this in vitro finding is unknown . 
Interaction of drug1 with Other Drugs : drug2 : Co-administration of drug3 ( 800 mg/day ) to patients taking drug4 chronically had no effect on drug5 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 : A single 10 mg dose of drug2 did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 at steady state . 
drug1 : No significant differences were observed in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug2 or drug3 with the addition of drug4 given as a single dose . 
Prothrombin times were not affected by drug1 . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug3 or the mean daily trough serum level of drug4 . 
drug1 or drug2 : No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of drug3 ( 0.125 mg ) and drug4 ( 10 mg ) when given together as a single dose . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 were not affected by multiple-dose administration of drug2 . 
drug1 has shown no clinically important potentiation of the pharmacodynamic effects of triazo lam or drug2 . 
Because of the possible additive effects of drugs that may depress the nervous system , drug1 or drug2 should be used cautiously in combination with drug3 . 
Oral drug1 : Multiple dose administration of drug2 ( 8 mg/day monotherapy ) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of oral drug3 in healthy women of childbearing age . 
drug1 : drug2 pharmacokinetics were not significantly different before and after drug3 multiple-dose regimens . 
This indicates that drug1 does not cause induction or inhibition of the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems responsible for the metabolism of drug2 . 
Interaction of drug1 with Highly Protein Bound Drugs : In vitro data showed that drug2 is 96 % bound to human plasma protein and therefore has the potential to interact with other highly protein bound compounds . 
Such an interaction can potentially lead to higher free fractions of either drug1 or the competing drug . 
drug1 dosed as a 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneous injection q12h for four doses did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug2 or the level of platelet aggregation in healthy adults . 
The adverse effects of drug1 , such as myelosuppression and diarrhea , would be expected to be exacerbated by other drug2 having similar adverse effects . 
Patients who have previously received pelvic/ abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of drug1 . 
The concurrent administration of drug1 with irradiation has not been adequately studied and is not recommended . 
Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving drug1 , and it is possible that the administration of drug2 as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect . 
However , serious opportunistic infections have not been observed , and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia . 
Hyperglycemia has also been reported in patients receiving drug1 . 
Usually , this has been observed in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or evidence of glucose intolerance prior to administration of drug1 . 
It is probable that drug1 , given as antiemetic prophylaxis , contributed to hyperglycemia in some patients . 
The incidence of akathisia in clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule was greater ( 8.5 % , 4/47 patients ) when drug1 was administered on the same day as drug2 than when these drugs were given on separate days ( 1.3 % , 1/80 patients ) . 
The 8.5 % incidence of akathisia , however , is within the range reported for use of drug1 when given as a premedication for other chemotherapies . 
It would be expected that drug1 use during therapy with drug2 would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea , but this has not been studied . 
In view of the potential risk of dehydration secondary to vomiting and/or diarrhea induced by drug1 , the physician may wish to withhold drug2 during dosing with drug3 and , certainly , during periods of active vomiting or diarrhea . 
Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions There are no known interactions between drug1 and laboratory tests . 
No specific information available

drug1 : The combined use of drug2 and drug3 should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination . 
drug1 : Since drug2 may bind other drugs given concurrently , patients should take drug3 at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a drug4 to avoid impeding its absorption . 
drug1 : Because drug2 can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine , and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of drug3 including drug4 , there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration . 
The benefits and risks of using drug1 with drug2 and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered , and the lowest effective dose employed 
. 
Drug-drug interactions In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that drug1 and drug2 are not inhibitors of cytochrome ( CYP ) P450 isoforms CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP1A2 . 
They are weak inhibitors of CYP2C19 and CYP2A6 , and mild-to-moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9 at therapeutic concentrations . 
Potentiation of drug1 has been observed with prolongation of the prothrombin time/INR . 
drug1 have been shown to bind other drugs given concurrently . 
Therefore , drug1 should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a drug2 to avoid impeding its absorption . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 ( equivalent to 145mg drug2 ) with drug3 ( 40 mg ) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean Cmax and AUC values for drug4 by 36 % ( range from 69 % decrease to 321 % increase ) and 28 % ( range from 54 % decrease to 128 % increase ) , respectively , and for 3 -hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55 % ( range from 32 % decrease to 314 % increase ) and 39 % ( range from 24 % decrease to 261 % increase ) , respectively in 23 healthy adults . 
A single dose of drug1 had no clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 ( equivalent to 145 mg drug2 ) with drug3 ( 20 mg ) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17 % decrease ( range from 67 % decrease to 44 % increase ) in drug4 AUC values in 22 healthy males . 
The drug1 Cmax values were not significantly affected by drug2 . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 were not significantly affected by drug2

If additional drug1 are to be administered by any route , they should be used with caution because the pharmacologically predictable sympathetic effects of drug2 may be potentiated . 
When drug1 , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , was co-administered with drug2 at steady-state , exposure to either drug was not altered . 
Dosage adjustments of drug1 are not necessary when the drug is given concomitantly with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors . 
Concomitant treatment with drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 ) , drug4 , or drug5 may potentiate any hypokalemic effect of drug6 . 
The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of drug1 ( such as drug2 or drug3 ) can be acutely worsened by drug4 , especially when the recommended dose of the drug5 is exceeded . 
Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known , caution is advised in the co-administration of drug1 with drug2 . 
drug1 , as with other drug2 , should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with drug3 , drug4 , or drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the action of drug5 on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents . 
Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias . 
The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 ) by patients receiving drug4 has not been completely evaluated . 
In two combined 12-week placebo controlled trials that included drug1 doses of 15 mcg twice daily , 25 mcg twice daily , and 50 mcg once daily , 54 of 873 drug2 -treated subjects received concomitant drug3 at study entry . 
In a 12-month controlled trial that included a 50 mcg once daily drug1 dose , 30 of the 528 drug2 -treated subjects received concomitant drug3 at study entry . 
In these trials , heart rate and systolic blood pressure were approximately 2-3 bpm and 6-8 mm Hg higher , respectively , in subjects on concomitant drug1 compared with the overall population . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently . 
drug1 not only block the therapeutic effects of drug2 , but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients . 
Therefore , patients with COPD should not normally be treated with drug1 . 
However , under certain circumstances , e.g. , as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction , there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of drug1 in patients with COPD . 
In this setting , drug1 could be considered , although they should be administered with caution . 
Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of drug1 .

drug1 might interfere with desirable antimuscarinic effects of drugs used concomitantly . 
Drugs which inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A3/4 also inhibit the metabolism of drug1 . 
drug1 should be used with caution in individuals known or suspected to be deficient in CYP2D6 activity , based on previous experience , as they may be at a higher risk of adverse events . 
In an in vitro study , cytochrome P450 isozymes 1A2 , 2A6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , and 3A4 were not inhibited by exposure to drug1 . 
In a Phase I trial using escalating doses of drug1 ( 110-200 mg/m2 ) and drug2 ( 50 or 75 mg/m2 ) given as sequential infusions , myelosuppression was more profound when drug3 was given after drug4 than with the alternate sequence ( ie , drug5 before drug6 ) . 
Pharmacokinetic data from these patients demonstrated a decrease in drug1 clearance of approximately 33 % when drug2 was administered following drug3 . 
The metabolism of drug1 is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoen-zymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 . 
In the absence of formal clinical drug interaction studies , caution should be exercised when administering drug1 concomitantly with known substrates or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 . 
Potential interactions between drug1 , a substrate of CYP3A4 , and drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 ) , which are substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 , have not been evaluated in clinical trials . 
Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of drug1 ( and its active metabolite drug2 ) may be increased when drug3 and drug4 are used in combination . 
Hematology : drug1 therapy should not be administered to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm3 . 
In order to monitor the occurrence of myelotoxicity , it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving drug1 . 
Patients should not be re-treated with subsequent cycles of drug1 until neutrophils recover to a level 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level 100,000 cells/mm3 . 
In the case of severe neutropenia ( 500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more ) during a course of drug1 therapy , a 20 % reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy is recommended . 
For patients with advanced HIV disease and poor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi s sarcoma , drug1 , at the recommended dose for this disease , can be initiated and repeated if the neutrophil count is at least 1000 cells/mm3 . 
Hypersensitivity Reactions : Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing Cremophor EL ( eg , drug1 for injection concentrate and drug2 for injection concentrate ) should not be treated with drug3 . 
In order to avoid the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions , all patients treated with drug1 should be premedicated with drug2 ( such as drug3 ) , diphen-hydramine and drug4 ( such as drug5 or drug6 ) . 
Minor symptoms such as flushing , skin reactions , dyspnea , hypotension , or tachycardia do not require interruption of therapy . 
However , severe reactions , such as hypotension requiring treatment , dyspnea requiring drug1 , angioedema , or generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of drug2 and aggressive symptomatic therapy . 
Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with drug1 . 
Cardiovascular : Hypotension , bradycardia , and hypertension have been observed during administration of drug1 , but generally do not require treatment . 
Occasionally drug1 infusions must be interrupted or discontinued because of initial or recurrent hypertension . 
Frequent vital sign monitoring , particularly during the first hour of drug1 infusion , is recommended . 
Continuous cardiac monitoring is not required except for patients with serious conduction abnormalities . 
Nervous System : Although the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy is frequent , the development of severe symptomatology is unusual and requires a dose reduction of 20 % for all subsequentcourses of drug1 . 
drug1 contains dehydrated alcohol USP , 396 mg/mL ; 
consideration should be given to possible CNS and other effects of drug1 . 
Hepatic : There is limited evidence that the myelotoxicity of drug1 may be exacerbated in patients with serum total bilirubin 2 times ULN . 
Extreme caution should be exercised when administering drug1 to such patients , with dose reduction as recommended in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Table 17 . 
InjectionSite Reaction : Injection site reactions , including reactions secondary to extravasation , were usually mild and consisted of erythema , tenderness , skin discoloration , or swelling at the injection site . 
These reactions have been observed more frequently with the 24-hour infusion than with the 3-hour infusion . 
Recurrence of skin reactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of drug1 at a different site , ie , recall , has been reported rarely . 
Rare reports of more severe events such as phlebitis , cellulitis , induration , skin exfoliation , necrosis , and fibrosis have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of drug1 safety . 
In some cases the onset of the injection site reaction either occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed by a week to ten days . 
A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time . 
Given the possibility of extravasation , it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration . 
drug1 is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 . 
Inhibition of these isoenzymes may increase the plasma concentration of drug1 . 
drug1 is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 . 
Consequently , plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by these two isoenzymes will be decreased when drug1 is co-administered . 
drug1 had no relevant inhibitory effect on any CYP isoenzymes tested ( CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 ) . 
Consequently , drug1 is not expected to increase the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by these enzymes . 
drug1 , Including Oral , Injectable , Transdermal , and Implantable drug2 : An interaction study demonstrated that co-administration of drug3 and the oral drug4 drug5 produced average decreases of drug6 and drug7 levels of 14 % and 31 % , respectively . 
However , decreases in exposure were as much as 56 % and 66 % , respectively , in individual subjects . 
Therefore , drug1 , including oral , injectable , transdermal , and implantable forms , may not be reliable when drug2 is co-administered . 
Women should practice additional methods of contraception and not rely on hormonal contraception alone when taking drug1 . 
Specific interaction studies have demonstrated the following : drug1 : During the first day of concomitant administration , trough concentrations of drug2 were increased by about 30-fold . 
Steady-state drug1 plasma concentrations were 3- to 4-fold higher than in the absence of drug2 . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated .

Caution should be exercised if drug1 and drug2 are used together . 
drug1 : An increased risk of elevated liver aminotransferases was observed in patients receiving concomitant therapy with drug2 . 
Therefore , the concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated , and alternative drug3 should be considered . 
Co-administration of drug1 decreased the plasma concentrations of drug2 by approximately 40 % . 
The plasma concentrations of drug1 were also decreased by approximately 30 % . 
drug1 is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other oral drug2 that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 . 
The possibility of worsened glucose control in patients using these agents should be considered . 
drug1 : Co-administration of drug2 125 mg b.i.d. and drug3 , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , increased the plasma concentrations of drug4 by approximately 2-fold . 
No dose adjustment of drug1 is necessary , but increased effects of drug2 should be considered . 
drug1 and Other drug2 : Co-administration of drug3 decreased the plasma concentrations of drug4 ( a CYP3A4 substrate ) , and its active -hydroxy acid metabolite , by approximately 50 % . 
The plasma concentrations of drug1 were not affected . 
drug1 is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other drug2 that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4 , such as drug3 and drug4 . 
The possibility of reduced drug1 efficacy should be considered . 
Patients using CYP3A4 metabolized drug1 should have cholesterol levels monitored after drug2 is initiated to see whether the drug3 dose needs adjustment . 
drug1 : Co-administration of drug2 500 mg b.i.d. for 6 days decreased the plasma concentrations of both drug3 ( a CYP2C9 substrate ) and drug4 ( a CYP3A4 substrate ) by 29 and 38 % , respectively . 
Clinical experience with concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension did not show clinically relevant changes in INR or drug3 dose ( baseline vs. end of the clinical studies ) , and the need to change the drug4 dose during the trials due to changes in INR or due to adverse events was similar among drug5 - and placebo-treated patients . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 : drug4 has no significant pharmacokinetic interactions with drug5 and drug6 , and drug7 has no significant effect on plasma levels of drug8 . 
No drug interactions have been reported between drug1 and the therapy standard in neonates with restricted pulmonary or systemic blood flow . 
Standard therapy includes drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 ; 
drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 ; 
drug1 ; 
and drug1 , such as drug2 . 
drug1 : The potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between drug2 and other agents has not been formally studied . 
When drug1 or drug2 is used at the same time as other medicines or substances the following interactions must be taken into account : - drug3 and drug4 may enhance the action of drug5 . 
For this reason , the dose of the drug1 should be reduced by 30 - 50 % at the start of treatment with drug2 or drug3 retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters 
. 
- The action of drug1 and drug2 may be enhanced by drug3 or drug4 . 
This may be due to an improved glucose utilization with simultaneous reduction in drug1 requirement 
. 
- In isolated cases , a pronounced though reversible , impairment of renal function ( accompanied by a corresponding increase in the serum creatinine level ) has been reported in organ transplant patients receiving drug1 therapy and concomitant drug2 . 
Accordingly , renal function should be closely monitored in these patients and , in the event of relevant significant changes in laboratory parameters , drug1 should , if necessary , be discontinued 
. 
- When drug1 or drug2 is used concurrently with drug3 ( e.g. drug4 ) , an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines , since the absorption of drug5 or drug6 is impaired 
. 
- drug1 or drug2 ( with hepatotoxic potential ) must not be administered together with drug3 or drug4 . 
Care should be given when administering this drug to patients with symptoms of myasthenic weakness who are also on drug1 . 
Since symptoms of anticholinesterase overdose ( cholinergic crisis ) may mimic underdosage ( myasthenic weakness ) , their condition may be worsened by the use of this drug . 
May interact with thyroid medication ( e.g. , drug1 ) , drug2 -containing products , drug3 , drug4 ( e.g. , drug5 , drug6 ) , and drug7 ( e.g. , drug8 , drug9 ) . 
This product can affect the results of certain lab tests . 
Drug/LaboratoryTest Interactions drug1 may interfere with bioassay procedures for the determination of drug2 levels . 
Since drug1 is primarily eliminated by the kidneys , coadministration of drug2 with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either drug3 or the coadministered drug . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 did not result in significant drug interactions . 
The effects of coadministration of drug1 with other drugs that are renally eliminated or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated , and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when drug2 is coadministered with such drugs . 
drug1 has additive effects with drug2 and other drug3 ( drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , etc ) . 
drug1 prolong and intensify the anticholinergic ( drying ) effects of drug2 . 
Formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drug1 . 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 did not influence drug5 clearance . 
The majority of patients in RA clinical studies received one or more of the following concomitant medications with drug1 : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , and drug12 . 
Concurrent administration of a drug1 with drug2 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and no significant additional efficacy over use of the drug3 alone . 
Concurrent therapy with drug1 and drug2 is not recommended . 
There is insufficient experience to assess the safety and efficacy of drug1 administered concurrently with drug2 , and therefore such use is not recommended . 
drug1 may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of drug2 or drug3 ; 
also , concurrent use of this medication may antagonise the anti-glaucoma and miotic actions of ophthalmic drug1 . 
drug1 : These drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions . 
Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive , use of drug1 -containing or drug2 ( like drug3 or drug4 ) and drug5 within 24 hours of each other should be avoided . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 resulted in a 27 % decrease in drug3 clearance and an increase in Cmax of approximately 6 % . 
No dose adjustment is necessary . 
Other drug1 Concomitant use of other drug2 within 24 hours of treatment with drug3 is contraindicated . 
drug1 : The pharmacokinetics of drug2 were not affected by coadministration of drug3 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : drug3 ( e.g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 ) have been rarely reported to cause weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination when coadministered with drug8 . 
If concomitant treatment with drug1 and an drug2 is clinically warranted , appropriate observation of the patient is advised . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 and drug3 resulted in a 24 % increase in plasma concentrations of drug4 . 
No dose adjustment is necessary . 
Coadministration of drug1 and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor drug2 ( 400 mg q.d. for 3 days ) resulted in an approximately 60 % increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximal plasma concentrations of drug3 . 
Although the interaction between drug1 and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ) has not been studied , increased exposures to drug5 may be expected when drug6 is used concomitantly with these medications . 
drug1 is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests . 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted .

Increased thyroid-binding globulin ( TBG ) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels , as measured by protein-bound iodine ( PBI ) , T4 levels ( by column or by radioimmunoassay ) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay . 
T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG . 
Free T4 and T3 concentrations are unaltered . 
Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of drug1 . 
3 . 
Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum , i.e. , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) , leading to increased total circulating drug1 and drug2 , respectively . 
Free hormone concentrations may be decreased .

drug1 : In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of drug2 and drug3 , plasma drug4 mean cmax and AUC increased by an average of 34 % and 24 % , respectively , and drug5 mean renal clearance decreased by 14 % . 
No information is available about the interaction of drug1 and drug2 following multiple doses of either drug . 
Although not observed in this study , adverse effects could potentially arise from co-administration of drug1 and drug2 by inhibition of tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter systems . 
Accordingly , careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of drug1 is recommended in patients concomitantly taking drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : As with other drug2 , the renal excretion of drug3 is inhibited by drug4 . 
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions As a result of administration of drug1 , a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur . 
This has been observed with Benedict s and Fehling s solutions and also with Clinitest tablets . 
May interact with the following : drug1 , drug2 ( use with drug3 may prevent the drug4 from working properly ; 
drug1 is metabolized by the liver , and it is theoretically possible that its metabolism may be enhanced by drugs known to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes . 
However , neither drug1 nor drug2 appears to affect drug3 metabolism . 
Binding to plasma protein is not significantly altered by drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 . 
Binding to plasma proteins is reduced by drug1 and clotibrate and increased by drug2 . 
Cardiovascular collapse in patients treated simultaneously with varapamil and drug1 is rare . 
The combination of therapeutic doses of intravenous drug1 and drug2 in drug3 a-chloralose anesthetized swine has resulted in ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia . 
It is recommended that the combination of intravenous drug1 and drug2 , such as drug3 , not be used together during the management of malignant hyperthermia crisis until the relevance of these findings to humans is established . 
Administration of drug1 may potentiate drug2 -induced neuromuscular block . 
The effectiveness of drug1 -only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the drug2 drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , and the drug6 drug7 . 
No significant interaction has been found with broad-spectrum drug1 . 
drug1 can inhibit CYP2C19 and induce CYP3A4/5 with potentially important effects on plasma concentrations of other drugs . 
In addition , several drug1 s that are cytochrome P450 inducers can decrease plasma concentrations of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 was evaluated in human liver microsomes to determine its capacity to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of other drugs . 
Results demonstrate that drug1 and its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite ( drug2 ) have little or no capacity to function as inhibitors for most of the human cytochrome P450 enzymes evaluated ( CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , CYP4A9 and CYP4A11 ) with the exception of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 . 
Although inhibition of CYP 3A4/5 by drug1 and drug2 did occur at high concentrations , it is not likely to be of clinical significance . 
The inhibition of CYP-2C19 by drug1 and drug2 , however , is clinically relevant . 
In vitro , the UDP-glucuronyl transferase level was increased , indicating induction of this enzyme . 
Increases of 22 % with drug1 and 47 % with drug2 were observed . 
As drug1 , the predominant plasma substrate , is only a weak inducer of UDP-glucuronyl transferase , it is unlikely to have an effect on drugs that are mainly eliminated by conjugation through UDP-glucuronyl transferase ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 ) . 
In addition , drug1 and drug2 induce a subgroup of the cytochrome P450 3A family ( CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 ) responsible for the metabolism of drug3 and oral drug4 , resulting in a lower plasma concentration of these drugs . 
As binding of drug1 to plasma proteins is low ( 40 % ) , clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely . 
drug1 : Potential interactions between drug2 and other drug3 were assessed in clinical studies . 
The effect of these interactions on mean AUCs and Cmin are summarized in Table 2 : Table 2 : Summary of AED interactions with drug1

1- nc denotes a mean change of less than 10 % 2- Pediatrics 3- Mean increase in adults at high drug1 doses In vivo , the plasma levels of drug2 increased by up to 40 % , when drug3 was given at doses above 1200 mg/day . 
Therefore , when using doses of drug1 greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy , a decrease in the dose of drug2 may be required . 
The increase of drug1 level , however , is small ( 15 % ) when given with drug2 . 
Strong inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes ( i.e. drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ) have been shown to decrease the plasma levels of drug4 ( 29-40 % ) . 
No autoinduction has been observed with drug1 . 
Hormonal drug1 Co-administration of drug2 with an oral drug3 has been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal components , drug4 ( EE ) and drug5 ( LNG ) . 
The mean AUC values of EE were decreased by 48 % [90 % CI : 22-65 ] in one study and 52 % [90 % CI : 38-52 ] in another study [1,2 ] . 
The mean AUC values of LNG were decreased by 32 % [90 % CI : 20-45 ] in one study and 52 % [90 % CI : 42-52 ] in another study . 
Therefore , concurrent use of drug1 with drug2 may render these drug3 less effective . 
Studies with other oral or implant drug1 have not been conducted . 
drug1 s : After repeated co-administration of drug2 , the AUC of drug3 was lowered by 28 % [90 % CI : 20-33 ] . 
drug1 produced a decrease of 20 % [90 % CI : 18-27 ] of the plasma levels of drug2 . 
Other drug interactions drug1 , drug2 and drug3 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug4 . 
Results with drug1 wshow no evidence of interaction with either single or repeated doses of drug2 . 
THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF drug1 MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH drug2 SUCH AS drug3 , drug4 AND drug5 . 
Therefore when drug1 are administered concomitantly with drug2 their dosage should be reduced . 
Since drowsiness may occur with use of this drug , patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking drug1 . 
Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other drug1 , and cautioned that the effect of drug2 may be increased . 
Additive CNS depression may occur when drug1 are administered concomitantly with other drug2 including drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Patients receiving drug1 should be advised against the concurrent use of other drug2 . 
drug1 prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of drug2 . 
It is possible that the cardiovascular action of other drug1 could be enhanced by the addition of drug2 . 
In Europe , drug1 was observed to occasionally intensify the effect of drug2 taken concomitantly by patients suffering from hypertension ; 
this phenomenon was not observed in North American clinical trials . 
A study in eight healthy volunteers has shown a 50 % increase in mean peak drug1 plasma concentrations and a 90 % increase in mean area under the curve , after a one week course of drug2 at 1,000 mg/day and drug3 at 90 mg/day . 
This effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 by drug1 , which could decrease first pass metabolism of drug2 . 
Taking a drug1 while you are taking or within 2 weeks of taking drug2 may increase the risk of central nervous system depression or may cause a severe high blood pressure reaction . 
No formal drug interaction studies with drug1 have been conducted . 
In Study 1 , patients with colorectal cancer were given drug1 / drug2 / drug3 ( bolus-IFL ) with or without drug4 . 
drug1 concentrations were similar in patients receiving bolus-IFL alone and in combination with drug2 . 
The concentrations of drug1 , the active metabolite of drug2 , were on average 33 % higher in patients receiving bolus-IFL in combination with drug3 when compared with bolus-IFL alone . 
In Study 1 , patients receiving bolus-IFL plus drug1 had a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 diarrhea and neutropenia . 
Due to high inter-patient variability and limited sampling , the extent of the increase in drug1 levels in patients receiving concurrent drug2 and drug3 is uncertain . 
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require drug1 dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring . 
The following are examples of substances that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect and susceptibility to hypoglycemia : oral drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 ( e.g. , drug10 ) , drug11 . 
The following are examples of substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect : drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ( e.g. , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 ( e.g. , in oral drug15 ) . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 salts , and drug4 may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of drug5 . 
drug1 may cause hypoglycemia , which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia . 
In addition , under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , the signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent . 
Mixing of drug1 
A clinical study in healthy male volunteers ( n=24 ) demonstrated that mixing drug1 with drug2 immediately before injection produced some attenuation in the peak concentration of drug3 , but that the time to peak and the total bioavailability of drug4 were not significantly affected . 
If drug1 is mixed with drug2 , drug3 should be drawn into the syringe first . 
The injection should be made immediately after mixing . 
Because there are no data on the compatibility of drug1 and crystalline drug2 preparations , drug3 should not be mixed with these preparations . 
The effects of mixing drug1 with drug2 of animal source or drug3 preparations produced by other manufacturers have not been studied . 
Mixtures should not be administered intravenously . 
When used in external subcutaneous infusion pumps for drug1 , drug2 should not be mixed with any other drug3 or diluent . 
drug1 : drug2 may diminish adrenal suppression by drug3 . 
drug1 injection and potassium-depleting agents : When drug2 are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 ) , patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia . 
In addition , there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure . 
drug1 : drug2 have been reported to cause a significant decrease in drug3 clearance . 
drug1 : Concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis . 
If possible , drug1 should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating drug2 therapy . 
drug1 , oral : Co-administration of drug2 and drug3 usually results in inhibition of response to drug4 , although there have been some conflicting reports . 
Therefore , coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect . 
drug1 : Because drug2 may increase blood glucose concentrations , dosage adjustments of drug3 may be required . 
Antitubercular drugs : Serum concentrations of drug1 may be decreased . 
drug1 : drug2 may increase the clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 : Increased activity of both drug2 and drug3 may occur when the two are used concurrently . 
Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use . 
Dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) : False-negative results in the dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) in patients being treated with drug1 have been reported . 
Thus , results of the DST should be interpreted with caution in these patients . 
drug1 : Patients on drug2 may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia . 
drug1 : drug2 may enhance the metabolic clearance of drug3 , resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity , thus requiring an increase in drug4 dosage . 
drug1 , including oral drug2 : drug3 may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain drug4 , thereby increasing their effect . 
Hepatic Enzyme Inducers , Inhibitors and Substrates : Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP 3A4 ) enzyme activity ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) may enhance the metabolism of drug5 and require that the dosage of the drug6 be increased . 
Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 such as drug3 ) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of drug4 . 
drug1 is a moderate inducer of CYP 3A4 . 
Co-administration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 ) may increase their clearance , resulting in decreased plasma concentration . 
drug1 : drug2 has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain drug3 by up to 60 % , leading to increased risk of drug4 side effects . 
In addition , drug1 alone can inhibit adrenal drug2 synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : Concomitant use of drug3 ( or other drug4 ) and drug5 increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects . 
drug1 should be used cautiously in conjunction with drug2 in hypoprothrombinemia . 
The clearance of drug1 may be increased with concurrent use of drug2 . 
drug1 : In post-marketing experience , there have been reports of both increases and decreases in drug2 levels with drug3 co-administration , leading to alterations in seizure control . 
Skin tests : drug1 may suppress reactions to skin tests . 
drug1 : Co-administration with drug2 should be employed cautiously , as toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with concomitant use . 
drug1 : Patients on drug2 therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and drug3 or drug4 due to inhibition of antibody response . 
drug1 may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in drug2 . 
Routine administration of drug1 or toxoids should be deferred until drug2 therapy is discontinued if possible . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 , a P-glycoprotein substrate , with oral drug3 resulted in a reduction in clearance and an increase in drug4 Cmax and AUC values . 
Therefore , if drug1 is administered with drug2 , the clinician should be alert to the possibility of increases in drug3 levels . 
drug1 Inhibitors Felodipine is metabolized by drug2 . 
Co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors ( eg , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , grapefruit juice , drug4 ) with drug5 may lead to several- fold increases in the plasma levels of drug6 , either due to an increase in bioavailability or due to a decrease in metabolism . 
These increases in concentration may lead to increased effects , ( lower blood pressure and increased heart rate ) . 
These effects have been observed with co-administration of drug1 ( a potent drug2 inhibitor ) . 
Caution should be used when drug1 inhibitors are co-administered with drug2 . 
A conservative approach to dosing drug1 should be taken . 
The following specific interactions have been reported : Itraconazole Co-administration of another extended release formulation of drug1 with drug2 resulted in approximately 8-fold increase in the AUC , more than 6- fold increase in the Cmax , and 2-fold prolongation in the half- life of drug3 . 
Erythromycin Co-administration of drug1 ( drug2 ) with drug3 resulted in approximately 2.5- fold increase in the AUC and Cmax , and about 2- fold prolongation in the half- life of drug4 . 
Grapefruit juice Co-administration of drug1 with grapefruit juice resulted in more than 2-fold increase in the AUC and Cmax , but no prolongation in the half- life of drug2 . 
Cimetidine Co-administration of drug1 with drug2 ( a non-specific CYP-450 inhibitor ) resulted in an increase of approximately 50 % in the AUC and the Cmax , of drug3 . 
Beta-Blocking Agents A pharmacokinetic study of drug1 in conjunction with drug2 demonstrated no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
The AUC and Cmax of drug1 , however , were increased approximately 31 and 38 % , respectively . 
In controlled clinical trials , however , drug1 including drug2 were concurrently administered with drug3 and were well tolerated . 
Digoxin When given concomitantly with drug1 the pharmacokinetics of drug2 in patients with heart failure were not significantly altered . 
drug1 : In a pharmacokinetic study , maximum plasma concentrations of drug2 were considerably lower in epileptic patients on long-term drug3 therapy ( eg , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 ) than in healthy volunteers . 
In such patients , the mean area under the drug1 plasma concentration-time curve was also reduced to approximately 6 % of that observed in healthy volunteers . 
Since a clinically significant interaction may be anticipated , alternative drug1 therapy should be considered in these patients . 
Tacrolimus drug1 may increase the blood concentration of drug2 . 
When given concomitantly with drug1 , the drug2 blood concentration should be followed and the tacrolimus dose may need to be adjusted . 
Other Concomitant Therapy In healthy subjects there were no clinically significant interactions when drug1 was given concomitantly with drug2 or drug3 . 
Interaction with Food See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism . 
DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS 1 . 
Accelerated prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , and platelet aggregation time ; 
increased platelet count ; 
increased factors II , VII antigen , VIII antigen , VIII coagulant activity , IX , X , XII , VII-X complex , II-VII-X complex , and beta-thromboglobulin ; 
decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and drug1 , decreased drug2 activity ; 
increased levels of drug1 and drug2 activity ; 
increased plasminogen antigen and activity . 
2 . 
Increased thyroid-binding globulin ( TBG ) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound drug1 ( PBI ) , T4 levels ( by column or by radioimmunoassay ) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay . 
T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG . 
Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered . 
Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of drug1 . 
3 . 
Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum , ( i.e. , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) ) leading to increased total circulating drug1 and drug2 , respectively . 
Free hormone concentrations may be decreased . 
Other plasma proteins may be increased ( angiotensinogen/renin substrate , alpha-1-antitrypsin , ceruloplasmin ) . 
4 . 
Increased plasma HDL and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations , reduced LDL cholesterol concentration , increased triglyceride levels . 
5 . 
Impaired glucose tolerance . 
6 . 
Reduced response to metyrapone test . 
When administered concurrently , the following drugs may interact with drug1 : drug2 : may enhance the potential for renal toxicity , bronchospasm and hypotension . 
drug1 ( e. g. , drug2 , etc. ) should be given concomitantly only with great caution . 
drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) : may potentiate drug4 - induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction . 
Avoid concomitant use unless necessary to control side effects of drug1 . 
If used concomitantly , closely monitor serum electrolytes and cardiac function . 
drug1 : drug2 -induced hypokalemia may potentiate drug3 toxicity . 
Serum potassium levels and cardiac function should be closely monitored and any deficit promptly corrected . 
drug1 : while a synergistic relationship with drug2 has been reported , concomitant use may increase the toxicity of drug3 by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion . 
drug1 ( e. g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , etc. ) : in vitro and animal studies with the combination of drug6 and drug7 suggest that drug8 may induce fungal resistance to drug9 . 
Combination therapy should be administered with caution , especially in immunocompromised patients . 
Other nephrotoxic medications : agents such as drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may enhance the potential for drug-induced renal toxicity , and should be used concomitantly only with great caution . 
Intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients requiring any combination of nephrotoxic medications . 
drug1 : drug2 -induced hypokalemia may enhance the curariform effect of drug3 ( e.g. , drug4 ) . 
Serum potassium levels should be monitored and deficiencies corrected . 
drug1 : acute pulmonary toxicity has been reported in patients receiving intravenous drug2 and drug3 . 
Drugs that inhibit or Induce CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 may affect the concentration on drug1 . 
drug1 should be used with caution in patients receiving other local drug2 or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive . 
In vitro studies indicate CYP3A4 isoform and CYP1A2 isoform mediate the metabolism of drug1 to drug2 and drug3 , respectively . 
Thus agents likely to be concomitantly administered with drug1 that are metabolized by this isoenzyme family may potentially interact with drug2 . 
Although no clinical studies have been conducted , it is likely that the metabolism of drug1 may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers ( such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) , CYP3A4 inhibitors ( azole antimycotics e.g. , drug5 ; 
certain drug1 e.g. , ritanovir ; 
drug1 e.g. , drug2 ; 
and drug1 e.g. , drug2 ) , CYP1A2 inducers ( drug3 ) and CYP1A2 inhibitors ( drug4 and drug5 ) . 
Dosage adjustment may be warranted when drug1 is concurrently administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP1A2 inhibitors as systemic drug2 levels may rise resulting in toxicity . 
drug1 : Steady-state trough concentrations of drug2 were about 56 % higher when 8 mg drug3 was coadministered with each dose of drug4 ( 15 mg/kg/day ) in eight neurocysticercosis patients . 
drug1 : In the fed state , drug2 ( 40 mg/kg ) increased mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of drug3 by about 50 % in healthy subjects ( n=10 ) compared with a separate group of subjects ( n=6 ) given drug4 alone . 
Mean T max and mean plasma elimination half-life of drug1 were unchanged . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 were unchanged following coadministration with drug2 ( 400 mg ) . 
drug1 : drug2 concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased ( about 2-fold ) in hydatid cyst patients treated with drug3 ( 10 mg/kg/day ) ( n=7 ) compared with drug4 ( 20 mg/kg/day ) alone ( n=12 ) . 
drug1 plasma concentrations were unchanged 4 hours after dosing . 
drug1 : The pharmacokinetics of drug2 ( drug3 5.8 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes ) were unchanged following a single oral dose of drug4 ( 400 mg ) in 6 healthy subjects . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may increase anticholinergic effect of drug4 . 
drug1 may decrease the effect of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
Co-administration of drug1 and drug2 or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission ( e.g. , drug3 ) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the drug4 may be potentiated . 
The effect of administering different drug1 serotypes at the same time or within less than 4 months of each other is unknown . 
However , neuromuscular paralysis may be potentiated by co-administration or overlapping administration of different drug1 serotypes . 
As with all drugs , the potential exists for interaction with other drugs by a variety of mechanisms . 
CNS-Active Drugs drug1 : drug2 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of drug3 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after drug4 administration and on the digit symbol substitution test ( DSST ) , symbol copying test , and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours after drug5 administration . 
The potentiation resulted from a CNS pharmacodynamic interaction ; 
drug1 did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 : Coadministration of single doses of drug2 20 mg and drug3 75 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration . 
The interaction was pharmacodynamic with no alteration of the pharmacokinetics of either drug . 
drug1 : Coadministration of a single dose of drug2 20 mg and drug3 20 mg daily for 7 days did not produce any interaction on psychomotor performance . 
Additionally , drug1 did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug2 , reflecting the absence of a role of CYP2D6 in drug3 s metabolism . 
drug1 : Coadministration of single doses of drug2 20 mg and drug3 50 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration . 
The interaction was pharmacodynamic with no alteration of the pharmacokinetics of either drug . 
drug1 : Coadministration of a single dose of drug2 10 mg and multiple doses of drug3 ER ( extended release ) 150 mg did not result in any significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either drug4 or drug5 . 
In addition , there was no pharmacodynamic interaction as a result of coadministration of drug1 and drug2 ER . 
drug1 : Coadministration of a single dose of drug2 and drug3 ( 10 and 25 mg , respectively ) resulted in a 15 % decrease in maximal plasma concentrations of drug4 , but no change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve . 
However , the pharmacodynamics of coadministration of drug1 and drug2 have not been evaluated . 
Caution should be exercised when these 2 agents are coadministered . 
Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 drug1 : CYP3A4 is ordinarily a minor metabolizing enzyme of drug2 . 
Multiple-dose administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer drug1 ( 600 mg every 24 hours , q24h , for 14 days ) , however , reduced drug2 Cmax and AUC by approximately 80 % . 
The coadministration of a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer , although not posing a safety concern , thus could lead to ineffectiveness of drug1 . 
An alternative non-CYP3A4 substrate drug1 may be considered in patients taking CYP3A4 inducers such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 CYP3A4 is a minor metabolic pathway for the elimination of drug1 because the sum of desethylzaleplon ( formed via CYP3A4 in vitro ) and its metabolites , drug2 and drug3 , account for only 9 % of the urinary recovery of a drug4 dose . 
Coadministration of single , oral doses of drug1 with drug2 ( 10 mg and 800 mg , respectively ) , a strong , selective CYP3A4 inhibitor produced a 34 % increase in drug3 s maximal plasma concentrations and a 20 % increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve . 
The magnitude of interaction with multiple doses of drug1 is unknown . 
Other strong selective CYP3A4 inhibitors such as drug1 can also be expected to increase the exposure of drug2 . 
A routine dosage adjustment of drug1 is not considered necessary . 
Drugs That Inhibit Aldehyde Oxidase The aldehyde oxidase enzyme system is less well studied than the cytochrome P450 enzyme system . 
drug1 : drug2 is reported to be a weak inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase in rat liver , but its inhibitory effects in human liver are not known . 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 following the administration of a single dose ( 10 mg and 50 mg , respectively ) of each drug . 
However , because both of these compounds have CNS effects , an additive pharmacodynamic effect is possible . 
Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde Oxidase and CYP3A4 drug1 : drug2 inhibits both aldehyde oxidase ( in vitro ) and CYP3A4 ( in vitro and in vivo ) , the primary and secondary enzymes , respectively , responsible for drug3 metabolism . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 ( 10 mg ) and drug2 ( 800 mg ) produced an 85 % increase in the mean Cmax and AUC of drug3 . 
An initial dose of 5 mg should be given to patients who are concomitantly being treated with drug1 . 
Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein drug1 is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( fraction bound 60 % 15 % ) ; 
therefore , the disposition of drug1 is not expected to be sensitive to alterations in protein binding . 
In addition , administration of drug1 to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound should not cause transient increase in free concentrations of the other drug . 
Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic Index drug1 : drug2 ( 10 mg ) did not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of drug3 ( 0.375 mg q24h for 8 days ) . 
drug1 : Multiple oral doses of drug2 ( 20 mg q24h for 13 days ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 ( R+ ) - or ( S- ) -enantiomers or the pharmacodynamics ( prothrombin time ) following a single 25-mg oral dose of drug4 . 
Drugs That Alter Renal Excretion drug1 : drug2 is known to affect renal function and , consequently , alter the renal excretion of other drugs . 
There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 following single dose administration ( 10 mg and 600 mg , respectively ) of each drug . 
This was expected because drug1 is primarily metabolized and renal excretion of unchanged drug2 accounts for less than 1 % of the administered dose . 
Because drug1 is metabolized by monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) , inhibition of this enzyme prolongs and potentiates the effect of drug2 . 
Patients who have been treated with drug1 within two to three weeks prior to the administration of drug2 should receive initial doses of drug3 no greater than one-tenth ( 1/10 ) of the usual dose . 
Concurrent administration of low-dose drug1 and drug2 may produce an additive or potentiating effect on urine flow . 
drug1 may potentiate the cardiovascular effects of adreneric agents . 
Cardiac effects of drug1 are antagonized by drug2 , such as drug3 and drug4 . 
The peripheral vasoconstriction caused by high doses of drug1 is antagonized by drug2 . 
drug1 -induced renal and mesenteric vasodilation is not antagonized by either drug2 or drug3 . 
drug1 ( such as drug2 ) and drug3 can suppress the drug4 rgic renal and mesenteric vasodilation induced with low dose dopamine infusion . 
drug1 or drug2 increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered drug3 , such as drug4 . 
This interaction appears to be related both to pressor activity and to beta-adrenergic stimulating properties of these drug1 and may produce ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension . 
Therefore , EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering drug1 to patients receiving drug2 or drug3 . 
It has been reported that results of studies in animals indicate that drug1 -induced ventricular arrhythmias during anesthesia can be reversed by drug2 . 
The concomitant use of drug1 s , vasoconstricting agents ( such as drug2 ) and some drug3 may result in severe hypertension . 
Administration of drug1 to patients receiving drug2 has been reported to lead to hypotension and bradycardia . 
It is suggested that in patients receiving drug1 , alternatives to drug2 should be used if drug3 therapy is needed . 
drug1 - Taking drug2 and a drug3 together may increase the risk of convulsions ( seizures ) . 
drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) - Taking drug3 and drug4 together may decrease the effects of drug5 . 
There have been isolated reports of patients experiencing increases in their prothrombin times when drug1 was added to drug2 therapy . 
The majority of these reports concerned variable elevations in prothrombin times without clinically significant sequelae . 
Although the relevance of these reports and any mechanism of coagulation alterations is unclear , patients on drug1 should have their prothrombin time monitored . 
The drug interaction studies with drug1 were performed both with drug2 and a rapidly hydrolyzed intravenous prodrug form . 
The results from trials using the intravenous prodrug are reported in this section as they relate to the role of drug1 in drug interactions . 
General : In humans , drug1 metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP 3A4 and 2C9 with glucuronidation being a further ( 20 % ) route of metabolism . 
In vitro studies indicate that drug1 is a moderate inhibitor of CYP 2C19 ( IC50 = 6 g/mL or 19 M ) and 2C9 ( IC50 = 13 g/mL or 41 M ) , and a weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6 ( IC50 = 31 g/mL or 100 M ) and 3A4 ( IC50 = 44 g/mL or 141 M ) . . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 may result in an increased risk of GI ulceration and complications compared to drug4 alone . 
Because of its lack of anti-platelet effect drug1 is not a substitute for drug2 for cardiovascular prophylaxis . 
In a parallel group drug interaction study comparing the intravenous prodrug form of drug1 at 40 mg BID ( n=10 ) vs placebo ( n=9 ) , drug2 had no effect on in vitro drug3 -mediated inhibition of arachidonate- or collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation . 
drug1 : drug2 BID did not show a significant effect on the plasma exposure or renal clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 : Reports suggest that drug2 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug3 . 
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : Clinical studies , as well as post-marketing observations , have shown that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patients . 
This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : Steady state plasma exposure ( AUC ) of drug3 ( 40 mg BID for 12 days ) was decreased by 27 % when co-administered with multiple doses ( 300 mg QD for 12 days ) of drug4 ( a CYP 3A4 inducer ) . 
Patients already stabilized on drug1 should be closely monitored for loss of symptom control with drug2 coadministration . 
drug1 did not have a statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 ( a CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19 substrate ) . 
Drug interaction studies with other drug1 have not been conducted . 
Routine monitoring should be performed when therapy with drug1 is either initiated or discontinued in patients on anticonvulsant therapy . 
drug1 : drug2 is primarily metabolized by CYP 2D6 and to a lesser extent by 3A4 . 
Coadministration with drug1 ( 40 mg BID for 7 days ) resulted in a significant increase in drug2 plasma levels suggesting that , at these doses , drug3 is a weak inhibitor of 2D6 . 
Even so drug1 plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of drug2 were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 40 mg BID for 7 days produced significant decreases in drug3 serum clearance ( 25 % ) and renal clearance ( 30 % ) with a 34 % higher serum exposure compared to drug4 alone . 
drug1 serum concentrations should be monitored closely when initiating or changing therapy with drug2 in patients receiving drug3 . 
drug1 ( 450 mg BID for 7 days ) had no effect on drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 : The effect of drug2 on the anticoagulant effect of drug3 ( 1 - 8 mg/day ) was studied in healthy subjects by coadministration of drug4 40 mg BID for 7 days . 
drug1 caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of drug2 and drug3 ( 12 % and 15 % , respectively ) , and in the pharmacodynamic effects ( prothrombin time , measured as INR ) of drug4 . 
While mean INR values were only slightly increased with coadministration of drug1 , the day-to-day variability in individual INR values was increased . 
drug1 therapy should be monitored , particularly during the first few weeks , after initiating therapy with drug2 in patients receiving drug3 or similar agents . 
drug1 and drug2 : drug3 and drug4 are predominantly CYP 3A4 and 2C9 inhibitors , respectively . 
Concomitant single dose administration of drug1 20 mg with multiple doses of drug2 and drug3 produced a significant increase in exposure of drug4 . 
Plasma exposure ( AUC ) to drug1 was increased 62 % when coadministered with drug2 and 38 % when coadministered with drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 is a CYP 2C9 substrate . 
Coadministration of drug1 ( 10 mg BID for 7 days ) with drug2 ( 5 mg QD or 10 mg BID ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics ( exposure ) of drug3 . 
Coadministration of drug1 ( 40 mg BID ( day 1 ) and 40 mg QD ( days 2-7 ) ) with drug2 ( 5 mg QD ) did not affect either the pharmacokinetics ( exposure ) or the pharmacodynamics ( blood glucose and insulin levels ) of drug3 . 
Coadministration of drug1 ( 40 mg BID ( day 1 ) and 40 mg QD ( days 2-7 ) ) with drug2 ( 10 mg drug3 BID ) resulted in 21 % increase in drug4 AUC0-12 and a 16 % increase in drug5 Cmax leading to a 16 % decrease in glucose AUC0-24 . 
Insulin parameters were not affected . 
Because changes in glucose concentrations with drug1 coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL , dose adjustment for drug2 ( 5 mg QD and 10 mg BID ) with drug3 coadministration ( up to 40 mg QD ) is not indicated . 
Coadministration of drug1 with doses higher than 40 mg drug2 ( e.g. , 40 mg BID ) have not been studied . 
drug1 : drug2 is a CYP 3A4 substrate and CYP 2C19 substrate and inhibitor . 
drug1 steady state plasma concentrations ( 40 mg BID ) were not affected significantly with multiple doses of drug2 ( 40 mg QD ) . 
Coadministration with drug1 increased exposure of drug2 ( AUC ) by 46 % . 
Drugs whose absorption is sensitive to pH may be negatively impacted by concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 . 
However , because higher doses ( up to 360 mg QD ) of drug1 are tolerated in Zollinger-Ellison ( ZE ) patients , no dose adjustment for drug2 is recommended at current doses . 
Coadministration of drug1 with doses higher than 40 mg QD drug2 has not been studied . 
Oral drug1 : drug2 ( 40 mg BID ) did not induce the metabolism of the combination oral drug3 drug4 / drug5 ( 1 mg /35 mcg combination , drug6 1/35 ) . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drug2 1/35 increased the exposure of drug3 and drug4 by 20 % and 34 % , respectively . 
Although there is little risk for loss of contraceptive efficacy , the clinical significance of these increased exposures in terms of safety is not known . 
These increased exposures of drug1 and drug2 should be taken into consideration when selecting an oral drug3 for women taking drug4 . 
drug1 : drug2 ( drug3 ) is a CYP 3A4 and CYP 2C19 substrate . 
Plasma exposure of drug1 ( 10 mg BID ) was increased by 28 % following administration of drug2 ( 40 mg BID ) for 12 days , while plasma exposure of drug3 ( 40 mg BID ) was not substantially increased following administration of drug4 ( 10 mg BID ) for 12 days . 
Although the magnitude of changes in drug1 plasma exposure when coadministered with drug2 were not sufficient to warrant dosage adjustments , patients may experience enhanced sedative side effects caused by increased exposure of drug3 under this circumstance . 
Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle . 
When drug1 is co-administered with drug2 ( 500 mg p.o. every 6 hours ) , drug3 competes for active tubular secretion and reduces the renal clearance of drug4 . 
Based on total drug1 concentrations , drug2 increased the AUC by 25 % and reduced the plasma and renal clearances by 20 % and 35 % , respectively . 
The half-life increased from 4.0 to 4.8 hours . 
Because of the small effect on half-life , the coadministration with drug1 to extend the half-life of drug2 is not recommended . 
In vitro studies indicate that drug1 does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of drug2 or drug3 and that drug4 is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport . 
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that drug1 does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following six cytochrome p450 ( CYP ) isoforms : 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 and 3A4 . 
Drug interactions caused by inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated drug clearance or CYP-mediated drug clearance with the listed isoforms are unlikely . 
Other than with drug1 , no specific clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted 
.

Caution should be taken in concurrent or serial use of other neurotoxic and/ or nephrotoxic drugs because of possible enhancement of the nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity of drug1 . 
Caution should also be taken in concurrent or serial use of other drug1 and drug2 because they may enhance neomycin s nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity and potentiate drug3 neuromuscular blocking effects . 
Oral drug1 inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of drug2 , oral drug3 , drug4 and drug5 . 
The gastrointestinal absorption of drug1 also appears to be inhibited . 
Therefore , drug1 serum levels should be monitored . 
Oral drug1 may enhance the effect of drug2 in drug3 by decreasing vitamin K availability . 
- Drugs with ototoxic potential : Especially in the presence of impaired renal function , the use of parenterally administered drug1 in patients to whom drug2 are also being given should be avoided , except in life-threatening conditions . 
- Drugs with nephrotoxic potential : There has been no experience on the concurrent use of drug1 with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential . 
Therefore , the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided . 
- drug1 : drug2 should generally not be given with drug3 ( such as drug4 ) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of drug5 toxicity . 
- drug1 : Pretreatment with drug2 reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by drug3 . 
This antagonistic effect of drug1 on drug2 natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of drug3 . 
Thus , drug1 should not be administered concurrently with drug2 . 
- drug1 : drug2 blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during drug3 treatment and inhibits the drug4 -induced increase in plasma renin activity . 
Concurrent therapy with drug1 is thus not recommended . 
- drug1 : drug2 may potentiate the effect of various drug3 , necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs . 
- drug1 : Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect on drug2 blood levels . 
- drug1 : Interaction studies in humans have shown drug2 to have no effect on drug3 metabolism or on plasma prothrombin activity . 
Administration of drug1 to patients who are receiving drug2 or drug3 may result in an additive pressor effect . 
In patients who have received drug1 , drug2 may temporarily mask the residual effects of drug3 . 
In patients who have received general anesthesia utilizing a volatile agent known to sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines , administration of drug1 should be delayed until the volatile agent has been excreted in order to lessen the potential for arrhythmias , including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation . 
Effect of drug1 on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs : drug2 does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
The effect of drug1 on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated . 
Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of drug1 : Literature reports suggest that drug2 , an agent that decreases stomach acidity , does not greatly alter drug3 pharmacokinetics . 
In a study in which the 2 mg drug1 orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without drug2 ( an drug3 with multiple effects on the GI tract ) to healthy volunteers , the AUC of drug4 was 10 % lower and the Cmax of drug5 was 20 % lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with drug6 compared to when it was given alone . 
drug1 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
Cytochrome P-450 inducers , such as drug1 , drug2 and drug3 , induce drug4 metabolism , causing an approximately 30 % decrease in plasma drug5 levels . 
Although clinical studies have not been performed , based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in drug1 metabolism , inhibitors of this enzyme system , notably oral drug2 , should be used cautiously in patients receiving drug3 . 
Pharmacodynamic Interactions : The CNS-depressant action of the drug1 of drugs may be potentiated by drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , the drug7 , drug8 and drug9 , drug10 and the drug11 , and by other drug12 . 
Hypotension - Patients on Diuretic Therapy : Patients on drug1 , and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted , may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug2 . 
The possibility of hypotensive effects with drug1 can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug2 or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug3 . 
If it is necessary to continue the drug1 , initiate therapy with drug2 at a dose of 5 mg daily , and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized . 
When a drug1 is added to the therapy of a patient receiving drug2 , an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed . 
Studies with drug1 in combination with drug2 indicate that the dose of the drug3 can be reduced when it is given with a drug4 . 
drug1 : In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with drug2 , the co-administration of drug3 may result in a further deterioration of renal function . 
These effects are usually reversible . 
Reports suggest that drug1 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug2 , including drug3 . 
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
In a study in 36 patients with mild to moderate hypertension where the antihypertensive effects of drug1 alone were compared to drug2 given concomitantly with drug3 , the use of drug4 was associated with a reduced antihypertensive effect , although the difference between the two regimens was not significant . 
Other Agents : drug1 has been used concomitantly with drug2 and/or drug3 without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions . 
This included post myocardial infarction patients who were receiving intravenous or transdermal drug1 . 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when drug1 was used concomitantly with drug2 or drug3 . 
The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of drug1 . 
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium : drug1 attenuates potassium loss caused by drug2 . 
Use of drug1 with drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 ) , drug6 supplements , or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium . 
Therefore , if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia , they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium . 
Potassium sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure who are receiving drug1 . 
drug1 : drug2 toxicity has been reported in patients receiving drug3 concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium , including drug4 . 
drug1 toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of drug2 and the drug3 . 
It is recommended that serum drug1 levels be monitored frequently if drug2 is administered concomitantly with drug3 . 
If drug1 is to be combined with other drugs acting on the central nervous system , careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed . 
Animal experience indicates that drug1 prolongs the sleeping time after drug2 or after drug3 , increases the inhibitory effects of drug4 , but does not exhibit monoamine oxidase inhibition . 
Clinical studies have shown increased sedation with concurrent drug1 . 
The actions of the drug1 may be potentiated by drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 or other drug6 . 
If drug1 tablets are used to treat anxiety associated with somatic disease states , careful attention must be paid to possible drug interaction with concomitant medication . 
In bioavailability studies with normal subjects , the concurrent administration of drug1 at therapeutic levels did not significantly influence the bioavailability of drug2 tablets . 
Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship , physicians should be aware that variable effects an blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral drug1 and drug2 . 
The concomitant use of drug1 or other drug2 may have an additive effect . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 ( 6 mg/kg once every 24 hours for 5 days ) and drug3 ( 25 mg single oral dose ) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug , and the INR was not significantly altered . 
drug1 : drug2 may cause myopathy , which is manifested as muscle pain or weakness associated with elevated levels of CPK . 
There were no reports of skeletal myopathy in a placebo-controlled Phase I trial in which 10 healthy subjects on stable drug1 therapy were treated concurrently with drug2 ( 4 mg/kg once every 24 hours ) for 14 days . 
Experience with co-administration of drug1 and drug2 in patients is limited , therefore , consideration should be given to temporarily suspending use of drug3 in patients receiving drug4 . 
Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions : There are no reported drug-laboratory test interactions . 
If drug1 is given concomitantly with other drugs acting on the central nervous system , careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of all agents . 
The action of the drug1 may be potentiated by drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , or other drugs that produce CNS depression . 
Smokers have an increased clearance of drug1 as compared to nonsmokers ; 
this was seen in studies with drug1 . 
While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between drug1 and inducers of CYP3A , compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers ( such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) would be expected to decrease drug6 concentrations . 
drug1 : Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A ( CYP3A ) : The metabolism of drug2 to the major circulating metabolite drug3 and the metabolism of other drug4 is catalyzed by CYP3A . 
Consequently , drug1 should be avoided in patients receiving drug2 and drug3 , which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A . 
With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser , but still significant degree , drug1 should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction . 
The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related drug1 , presumably through inhibition of CYP3A : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and some drug7 . 
Drug Interaction with drug1 : A multiple-dose study was conducted to assess the effect of drug2 20 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 2 mg QHS after seven days . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 ( Cmax and AUC ) were not affected during multiple-dose drug2 , suggesting no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction . 
drug1 : Interaction with Other Drugs that are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) : At clinically relevant concentrations , in vitro studies indicate that drug2 ( 0.6 M ) was not inhibitory towards the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , and CYP3A . 
Therefore , based on these in vitro data , drug1 is very unlikely to inhibit the biotransformation of other drugs metabolized by these CYP isoforms 
.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using drug1 but not with those using drug2 . 
The administration of drug1 may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest ** , Benedict s solution , or Fehling s solution . 
It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions ( such as Clinistix * * or Tes-Tape ** ) be used . 
A false-positive direct Coombs test has been reported during treatment with other drug1 ; 
therefore , it should be recognized that a positive Coombs test may be due to the drug . 
drug1 is an inhibitor of CYP3A ( cytochrome P450 3A ) . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A ( e.g. , drug2 ) may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong both its therapeutic and adverse effects . 
drug1 is metabolized in proof by C.P.A. 
Coadministration of drug1 and drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease drug2 plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may increase drug2 plasma concentrations .

* This table is not all inclusive * * drug1 may not be effective due to decreased drug2 plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly 
drug1 
drug1 : Administration of drug2 with drug3 resulted in the appearance of unchanged drug4 in plasma ; 
therefore , drug1 should not be administered concurrently with drug2 because of the potential for serious and/or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias . 
Because a similar interaction is likely , drug1 should also not be administered concurrently with drug2 . 
drug1 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 with drug3 resulted in an 83 % increase in drug4 plasma AUC and a 51 % increase in drug5 plasma A.C. 
Currently , there are no safety and efficacy data available from the use of this combination .

If used in combination with drug1 hard gelatin capsules at the recommended dose of 600 mg tid , no dose adjustments are needed . 
Currently , there are no safety and efficacy data available from the use of this combination . 
drug1 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 with drug3 resulted in a 35 % increase in drug4 plasma A.C. 
This change was not considered clinically significant and no dose adjustment is needed when drug1 and drug2 are coadministered . 
drug1 
drug1 : It is recommended that drug2 be administered on an empty stomach ; 
therefore , drug1 should be administered ( with food ) one hour after or more than two hours before drug2 . 
A dose adjustment is not needed when drug1 is administered with drug2 . 
Little or no change in the pharmacokinetics of either drug was observed when drug1 was coadministered with drug2 or drug3 . 
drug1 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 and drug3 resulted in a 32 % decrease in drug4 plasma AUC and a 207 % increase in drug5 plasma A.C.

However , it was observed that the pharmacokinetics of drug1 was unaltered by concomitant drug2 in rheumatoid arthritis patients . 
In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent drug1 and drug2 therapy , a 7 % rate of serious infections was observed , which was higher than that observed with drug3 alone ( 0 % ) . 
Two percent of patients treated concurrently with drug1 and drug2 developed neutropenia ( ANC 1 x 109/L ) . 
Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with drug1 , to which drug2 was added , were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either drug3 CI or drug4 alone . 
The clinical significance of this observation is unknown . 
This drug may interact with drug1 or other drug2 ( may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or drug3 ) , drug4 or other medications with anticholinergic activity ( anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with drug5 ) , and drug6 ( concurrent use with drug7 may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of drug8 ) . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 
Concomitant use of drug1 supplements and drug2 may increase drug3 absorption 
Since drug1 is an drug2 , it may have a strong affinity for anions other than the bile acids . 
In vitro studies have indicated that drug1 binds a number of drugs . 
Therefore , drug1 Tablets may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication . 
The interval between the administration of drug1 Tablets and any other medication should be as long as possible . 
Patients should take other drugs at least one hour before or four hours after drug1 Tablets to avoid impeding their absorption . 
Repeated doses of drug1 given prior to a single dose of drug2 in human trials have been reported to decrease drug3 absorption . 
However , in a follow-up study in normal subjects , single-dose administration of drug1 and drug2 and twice-a-day administration for 5 days of both agents did not affect the extent of drug3 absorption , but had a small yet statistically significant effect on its rate of absorption ; 
the time to reach maximum concentration was delayed approximately 30 minutes . 
Effects on the absorption of other drug1 have not been determined . 
Therefore , patients on drug1 should be observed when drug2 Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen . 
Studies in humans show that the absorption of drug1 as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before drug2 . 
The absorption of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with drug6 ; 
these drugs were not tested to determine the effect of administration one hour before drug1 . 
No depressant effect on blood levels in humans was noted when drug1 was administered with any of the following drugs : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ( drug7 ) , drug8 , drug9 or drug10 . 
Particular caution should be observed with drug1 since there are conflicting results for the effect of drug2 on the availability of drug3 and drug4 . 
The potential for binding of these drugs if given concomitantly is present . 
Discontinuing drug1 could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug that is significantly bound to the drug2 has been titrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking drug3 . 
drug1 may also interfere with the absorption of oral drug2 supplements and drug3 . 
Studies to evaluate possible interactions between drug1 and drugs other than drug2 have not been performed .

Lethargy and somnolence have been reported following doses of drug1 and drug2 . 
Patients taking drug1 may not benefit from drug2 containing medicines , such as cough and cold preparations , antidiarrheal preparations , and drug3 . 
In an emergency situation when opioid analgesia must be administered to a patient receiving drug1 , the amount of drug2 required may be greater than usual , and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged . 
Administration of repeat doses of drug1 had no effect on the repeat dose pharmacokinetics of drug2 , drug3 or an drug4 /levonorgestrol oral drug5 in healthy subjects .

Concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 resulted in a 45 % increase in systemic exposure to drug3 . 
drug1 had no significant effect on the anticoagulant effect of drug2 in healthy subjects on stable drug3 therapy . 
However , because some drug1 have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of drug2 or its derivatives in patients , the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a drug3 is administered concomitantly with drug4 or its derivatives . 
drug1 form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metals . 
The absorption of oral drug1 is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of an drug2 containing drug3 and drug4 . 
drug1 - and/or drug2 -containing drug3 , products containing drug4 ( drug5 ) , drug6 containing drug7 or other metal cations , or drug8 ( drug9 ) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after drug10 . 
drug1 should not be taken within 2 hours of drug2 . 
Although the pressor activity of drug1 is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity , large doses of drug2 Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring .

drug1 has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 , drug3 , or the active metabolite of mycophenolate . 
drug1 reduced the blood AUC0-12 of drug2 by approximately 20 % , peak blood concentration ( Cmax ) by 16 % , and 12-hour blood concentration ( C12hr ) by 26 % in healthy subjects when drug3 ( 2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg 12 hours apart ) was administered on the 10th day of drug4 70 mg daily , as compared to results from a control period in which drug5 was administered alone . 
For patients receiving both therapies , standard monitoring of drug1 blood concentrations and appropriate drug2 dosage adjustments are recommended . 
In two clinical studies , drug1 ( one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses ) increased the AUC of drug2 by approximately 35 % . 
drug1 did not increase the plasma levels of drug2 . 
There were transient increases in liver ALT and AST when drug1 and drug2 were co-administered . 
A drug-drug interaction study with drug1 in healthy volunteers has shown a 30 % decrease in drug2 trough concentrations . 
Patients on drug1 should receive 70 mg of drug2 daily . 
In addition , results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance ( drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 ) with drug6 may result in clinically meaningful reductions in drug7 concentrations . 
It is not known which drug clearance mechanism involved in drug1 disposition may be inducible . 
When drug1 is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 , use of a daily dose of 70 mg of drug7 should be considered 
.

drug1 : Since both drug2 and drug3 can cause increased intracranial pressure , their combined use is contraindicated . 
drug1 and oral drug2 : Concomitant administration of drug3 and/or other oral drug4 with drug5 must be avoided because of the risk of hypervitaminosis A . 
Other : There appears to be no pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
Investigations into the effect of drug1 on the protein binding of drug2 ( drug3 ) revealed no interaction . 
Laboratory Tests If significant abnormal laboratory results are obtained , either dosage reduction with careful monitoring or treatment discontinuation is recommended , depending on clinical judgement . 
Blood Sugar : Some patients receiving drug1 have experienced problems with blood sugar control . 
In addition , new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during drug1 therapy , including diabetic ketoacidosis .

It is recommended that these tests be performed weekly or every other week until the lipid response to drug1 has stabilized . 
Liver Function Tests : Elevations of AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) or LDH were experienced by approximately 1 in 3 patients treated with drug1 . 
It is recommended that these tests be performed prior to initiation of drug1 therapy , at 1- to 2-week intervals until stable and thereafter at intervals as clinically indicated . 
drug1 is highly bound to plasma protein ( 99.9 % ) . 
Therefore , caution should be used when administering drug1 concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices , as competition for binding sites may occur ( e.g. , drug2 ) . 
In vitro metabolism studies have demonstrated that drug1 has no significant inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes . 
Although no drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted in vivo , it is expected that no significant interaction would occur when drug1 is co-administered with drugs that either are metabolized by or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes .

Read circulars for drug1 preparations before use of such concomitant therapy . 
In some patients , the administration of a drug1 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of drug2 , drug3 and drug4 . 
Therefore , when drug1 and drug2 are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the drug3 is obtained . 
Since drug1 and drug2 , including drug3 , may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels , the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently . 
drug1 : Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when drug2 was administered with drug3 , the concomitant use of drug4 with drugs of the drug5 ( including , for example , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 ) is contraindicated . 
drug1 s and drug2 : The following adverse events were experienced more commonly in patients receiving concomitant drug3 or drug4 ( n = 94 ) compared to patients not receiving these concomitant drugs ( n = 456 ) : hypotension 10 % vs 4 % , myocardial infarction 3 % vs 1 % , serious pneumonia 5 % vs 3 % , serious falls 9 % vs 3 % , and bone and joint injuries 6 % vs 2 % . 
The mechanism underlying many of these events is unknown , but may represent increased hypotension . 
drug1 : Since drug2 is a drug3 , it is possible that drug4 , such as the drug5 ( drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) or drug9 , may diminish the effectiveness of drug10 . 
Patients with major psychotic disorders , treated with drug1 , should be treated with drug2 only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks . 
Drugs Prolonging the QT/QTc Interval Caution should be exercised when prescribing drug1 concomitantly with drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions There are no known interactions between drug1 and laboratory tests . 
Since drug1 is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes , caution should be exercised when drug2 is coadministered with inhibitors of C.P.A. such as drug3 and drug4 or inhibitors of CYP2C19 such as drug5 . 
Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that drug1 and drug2 significantly increased the systemic exposure of drug3 and/or its major metabolites . 
Population pharmacokinetic studies showed higher concentrations of drug1 among patients concurrently treated with drug2 , an inhibitor of C.P.A. . 
drug1 does not , however , appear to cause increased blood levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 , as it had no effect on drug2 , a drug with metabolism very sensitive to C.P.A. inhibition . 
drug1 used in combination with other drugs known to adversely affect the hematopoietic system should be avoided if possible . 
Considerable caution should be exercised if drug1 is administered concurrently with drug2 ( drug3 ) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination . 
A two-way interaction between the drug1 , drug2 , and the drug3 s has been suggested . 
Presumably , drug1 acts as a stimulator of drug2 metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the drug3 and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations . 
Conversely , the drug1 have been reported to increase the serum levels and prolong the serum half-life of drug2 by inhibiting its metabolism . 
Although there is no documentation of such , a similar interaction between drug1 and the drug2 may occur . 
Caution is therefore advised when administering drug1 to patients receiving drug2 . 
Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of drug1 . 
A similar association , though less marked , has been suggested with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and possibly with drug7 and drug8 72 . 
A possible interaction has been suggested with drug1 and the herbal supplement St. Johns Wort based on some reports of oral drug2 users experiencing breakthrough bleeding shortly after starting St. Johns Wort . 
Pregnancies have been reported by users of drug1 who also used some form of St. Johns Wort . 
Healthcare prescribers are advised to consult the package inserts of medication administered concomitantly with oral drug1 . 
Combination Therapy : Any form of therapy which adds to the stress of the patient , interferes with nutrition or depresses bone marrow function will increase the toxicity of drug1 . 
Based on in vitro studies in human liver microsomes , drug1 appears to have no inhibitory or induction potential on the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by CYP 450 enzymes . 
The inhibitory potential of drug1 on CYP450 isoenzymes has not been studied . 
In vitro studies demonstrated that the plasma protein binding of drug1 was not affected by drug2 or drug3 , indicating no potential for protein binding-based drug interactions . 
In a drug interaction study , co-administration of orally inhaled drug1 and oral drug2 , an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 , had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug3 or drug4 . 
In another drug interaction study , co-administration of orally inhaled drug1 and oral drug2 , a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 , increased the exposure ( AUC ) of drug3 by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state , while levels of drug4 remained unchanged . 
Therefore , drug1 should be administered with caution with intranasal drug2 . 
No clinically significant adverse interactions with commonly used preanesthetic drugs , or drugs used during anesthesia ( drug1 , intravenous agents , and local drug2 ) were reported in clinical trials . 
The effect of drug1 on the disposition of other drugs has not been determined . 
Like drug1 , drug2 does not predispose to premature ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of exogenously infused drug3 in swine . 
Because drug1 is metabolized by a variety of hepatic CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes , inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance of drug2 . 
drug1 is a known strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and also inhibits CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 . 
In a pharmacokinetic study , 40 healthy female subjects received drug1 in escalating doses from 50 to 200 mg per day for 16 days , with coadministration of drug2 1 mg on the last day . 
drug1 increased mean drug2 plasma concentrations ( AUC ) approximately 6-fold and prolonged the half-life by approximately 3-fold . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors , including drug2 and drug3 , has not been evaluated , but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions . 
drug1 is a known strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 . 
In a pharmacokinetic study , 38 healthy female subjects received drug1 200 mg twice daily for 7 days , with coadministration of drug2 1 mg on the last day . 
drug1 increased mean drug2 plasma concentrations ( AUC ) by 29 % . 
Caution should be used when drug1 and drug2 are administered concomitantly . 
Coadministration of drug1 and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 has not been evaluated but should be undertaken with caution because of similar potential drug interactions . 
The effect of induction or inhibition of other pathways on exposure to drug1 and its metabolites is not known . 
In vitro human liver microsome studies and an in vivo metabolic probe study demonstrated that drug1 did not inhibit CYP enzymes 2D6 , 3A4 , 2C9 , or 2C19 . 
In vitro , at total drug concentrations 27-fold higher than peak plasma concentrations observed with the 1-mg dosage , drug1 inhibited CYP enzymes 1A2 ( 60 % ) and 2E1 ( 50 % ) . 
In an in vivo metabolic probe study , drug1 did not inhibit CYP2E1 but did produce 30 % inhibition of both CYP1A2 and N-acetyltransferase . 
Although not studied with drug1 , inhibition of N-acetyltransferase may have clinically relevant consequences for drugs such as drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
The effect on CYP1A2 was explored further in a clinical interaction study with drug1 and no effect on metabolism was observed . 
Another study showed that drug1 had no clinically significant effect on plasma concentrations of the oral drug2 drug3 and drug4 ( CYP3A4 substrates ) . 
A clinical interaction study was also conducted with drug1 and the CYP3A4 substrate drug2 . 
No significant effects on drug1 metabolism or QT interval were noted . 
The effect of drug1 on monoamine oxidases and on intestinal first pass secondary to high intraluminal concentrations have not been examined . 
Based on the above data from in vitro and in vivo studies , it is unlikely that drug1 will inhibit the hepatic metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by the major CYP enzyme 3A4 , as well as the CYP enzymes 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2E1 , or 1A2 . 
drug1 does not appear to induce the major cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) drug metabolizing enzyme 3A . 
drug1 also does not appear to induce CYP enzymes 2E1 or 2C19 . 
It is not known whether drug1 might induce other enzymes . 
drug1 - drug2 was observed to enhance ( in tissue culture ) the effect of drug3 in reducing the number of human breast cancer cells that were in the S phase . 
drug1 and drug2 - Although not reported , drug3 , via its metabolism to histamine , might decrease the efficacy of drug4 and drug5 . 
May interact with skin products or shampoos for dandruff or psoriasis . 
Most ( 98 % ) of plasma drug1 is protein bound . 
In vitro data in human plasma indicate that drug1 has no effect on protein binding of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 . 
There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on drug1 binding . 
drug1 has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving drug2 , drug3 s , and drug4 . 
In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers , the administration of a single 1 mg dose of drug1 on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral drug2 ( 400 mg twice daily ) resulted in a 10 % increase in mean AUC of drug3 ( p=0.006 ) , and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of drug4 . 
The clinical significance of this increase in drug1 AUC is unknown . 
In clinical trials , drug1 tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications ; 
while no formal interaction studies have been conducted , no interactions were observed . 
drug1 tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes : 1 . 
drug1 / drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 combinations , drug7 , drug8 ) . 
2 . 
drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 , drug5 ) . 
3 . 
drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) . 
4 . 
Cardiovascular agents ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 ) . 
5 . 
drug1 . 
6 . 
Gastrointestinal agents ( e.g. , drug1 ) . 
7 . 
drug1 and endocrine drugs . 
8 . 
drug1 and drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 ) . 
9 . 
Cold and flu remedies . 
drug1 modifies drug2 metabolism with increased serum levels of drug3 . 
This may increase or enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in some patients receiving chronic drug1 therapy . 
Caution is advised in patients receiving chronic concomitant therapy . 
By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of drug1 , drug2 may decrease serum concentrations of drug3 and its metabolites , with a consequent possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect . 
Caution is advised when beginning , discontinuing , or changing the dose of drug1 in patients receiving drug2 . 
Because of possible additive effects with other drug1 , concomitant use is not advisable . 
drug1 may increase the effects of other drug2 . 
drug1 may increase or decrease blood glucose levels . 
Consideration should be taken in patients being treated with drug1 agents . 
drug1 decreases urinary excretion of drug2 and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect . 
drug1 reduces urinary excretion of drug2 and may enhance its effect . 
drug1 may prevent the urinary antiseptic effect of drug2 . 
drug1 increases drug2 excretion and the drug3 may be decreased . 
drug1 and drug2 used concurrently increases the risk of renal calculus formation . 
drug1 may elevate drug2 levels . 
The drug1 test should be conducted in the absence of other drugs which directly affect the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins . 
These would include a variety of preparations which contain drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
The gonadotropin levels may be transiently elevated by drug1 , minimally elevated by drug2 , and suppressed by oral drug3 and drug4 . 
The response to drug1 may be blunted by drug2 and drug3 which cause a rise in prolactin . 
As drug1 Gel has the potential to produce local irritation in some patients , concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products ( medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers , soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect , and products with high concentrations of alcohol , astringents , spices or lime ) should be approached with caution . 
Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 in combination with drug4 Gel . 
If these preparations have been used it is advisable not to start therapy with drug1 Gel until the effects of such preparations in the skin have subsided . 
There have been no formal clinical studies to evaluate the drug interactions of drug1 with other medications . 
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of drug1 may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce , inhibit , or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
Caution should be exercised with these drugs when treating patients receiving drug1 as there is a potential for a significant interaction . 
drug1 accelerates the metabolism of drug2 ; 
therefore , if drug1 replacement is needed , drug2 should be prescribed . 
drug1 diminishes the effect of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 is usually well tolerated , but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure , severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina . 
Long Acting drug1 : drug2 may be safely co-administered with drug3 , but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination . 
drug1 : Immediate Release Capsules : Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated drug2 levels , and there is a possible interaction between drug3 and drug4 , it is recommended that drug5 levels be monitored when initiating , adjusting , and discontinuing drug6 to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization . 
Extended Release Tablets : Administration of drug1 with drug2 increased drug3 levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers . 
The average increase was 45 % . 
Another investigator found no increase in drug1 levels in 13 patients with coronary artery disease . 
In an uncontrolled study of over 200 patients with congestive heart failure during which drug1 blood levels were not measured , digitalis toxicity was not observed . 
Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated drug1 levels , it is recommended that drug2 levels be monitored when initiating , adjusting , and discontinuing drug3 to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization . 
drug1 : Immediate Release Capsules : There have been rare reports of an interaction between drug2 and drug3 ( with a decreased plasma level of drug4 ) . 
drug1 : There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking drug2 to whom drug3 was administered . 
However , the relationship to drug1 therapy is uncertain . 
drug1 : A study in 6 healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak drug2 plasma levels ( 80 % ) and area-under-the-curve ( 74 % ) after a 1 week course of drug3 at 1000 mg per day and drug4 at 40 mg per day . 
drug1 produced smaller , non-significant increases . 
The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of drug1 on hepatic cytochrome P-450 , the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of drug2 . 
If drug1 therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving drug2 , cautious titration is advised . 
drug1 should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any drug2 , including drug3 and drug4 . 
drug1 should not be used together with drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 ) , another arthritis medication . 
It should also be avoided in patients with blood , liver or kidney diseases , recent radiation treatment , or uncontrolled diabetes . 
Patients should report to their practitioners any new rashes , itching , mouth sores , or unusual taste while taking drug1 . 
drug1 is excreted slowly from the body . 
Safety and effectiveness in children has not been established . 
The potential for drug interactions with drug1 has been studied in combination with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
There were no clinically significant drug interactions for any of these drugs 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
May interact with addictive medications , especially drug1 with habituating potential ( prolonged concurrent use may increase the risk of habituation ) , drug2 or CNS depression producing medications ( concurrent use may increase the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or drug3 ) . 
drug1 potentiates other drug2 such as drug3 or drug4 and drug5 s . 
Patients undergoing systemic anticholinesterase treatment should be warned of the possible additive effects of drug1 . 
Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of drug1 are to be administered with drug2 because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of drug3 . 
Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other drug1 with potent drug2 such as drug3 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The administration of drug1 may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using Clinitest tablets . 
It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions ( such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape ) be used . 
There have been no formal studies of the interaction of drug1 for Topical Solution with any other drugs , and no drug-specific interactions were noted during any of the controlled clinical trials . 
It is , however , possible that concomitant use of other known drug1 such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 and drug7 might increase the photosensitivity reaction of actinic keratoses treated with the drug8 for Topical Solution . 
drug1 is metabolized to drug2 by cytochrome CYP 3A4 . 
Because CYP 3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of drug1 , patients already on CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as drug2 ( e.g. 
drug1 ) , drug2 ( e.g. drug3 ) , and drug4 ( e.g. drug5 , drug6 and drug7 ) should have their dose of drug8 or drug9 adjusted . 
Based on anecdotal reports , there may be an interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
There have been a number of reports in the post-marketing experience of coma and death associated with the concomitant intravenous misuse of drug1 and drug2 by addicts . 
In many of these cases , drug1 was misused by self-injection of crushed drug2 tablets . 
drug1 and drug2 should be prescribed with caution to patients on drug3 or other drugs that act on the central nervous system , regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse . 
Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of drug1 while under treatment with drug2 or drug3 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) has been reported to produce ANTABUSE-like side effects when given concomitantly with drug3 . 
The physician is advised to monitor plasma levels of drug1 and to decrease the dose if necessary . 
Because of reports of prolongation of the prothrombin time beyond the therapeutic range in patients taking concurrent drug1 and drug2 , it is suggested that the prothrombin time be monitored carefully , and the dose of drug3 or other drug4 -like drugs should be adjusted accordingly , in patients taking both drugs . 
drug1 is a substrate , a moderate inhibitor , and an inducer of CYP3A4 . 
drug1 is also an inducer of CYP2C9 . 
Effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of other agents 
As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 , drug1 can increase plasma concentrations of coadministered medicinal products that are metabolized through CYP3A4 . 
drug1 has been shown to induce the metabolism of drug2 and drug3 , which are metabolized through CYP2C9 . 
Coadministration of drug1 with these drugs or other drugs that are known to be metabolized by CYP2C9 , such as drug2 , may result in lower plasma concentrations of these drugs . 
drug1 is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein transporter , as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of drug2 with drug3 in a clinical drug interaction study . 
drug1 : In clinical drug interaction studies , drug2 did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 or drug4 . 
No clinical or drug interaction study was conducted with drug1 . 
drug1 : drug2 : drug3 , when given as a regimen of 125mg with drug4 coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1 , and drug5 when given as 80 mg/day with drug6 coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5 , increased the AUC of drug7 , a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold , on Days 1 and 5 . 
The oral drug1 doses should be reduced by approximately 50 % when coadministered with drug2 , to achieve exposures of drug3 similar to those obtained when it is given without drug4 . 
The daily dose of drug1 administered in clinical studies with drug2 reflects an approximate 50 % reduction of the dose of drug3 . 
drug1 
drug1 , when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 , increased the AUC of drug2 , a CYP3A4 substrate , by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3 , when drug3 was coadministered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on Days 2 and 3 . 
The IV drug1 dose should be reduced by approximately 25 % , and the oral drug2 dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % when coadministered with drug3 to achieve exposures of drug4 similar to those obtained when it is given without drug5 . 
drug1 : A single 125-mg dose of drug2 was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilized on chronic drug3 therapy . 
Although there was no effect of drug1 on the plasma AUC of drug2 or drug3 determined on Day 3 , there was a 34 % decrease in drug4 ( a CYP2C9 substrate ) trough concentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in the prothrombin time ( reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR ) 5 days after completion of dosing with drug5 . 
In patients on chronic drug1 therapy , the prothrombin time ( INR ) should be closely monitored in the 2-week period , particularly at 7 to 10 days , following initiation of the 3-day regimen of drug2 with each chemotherapy cycle . 
drug1 : drug2 , when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 , decreased the AUC of drug3 ( a CYP2C9 substrate ) by 23 % on Day 4 , 28 % on Day 8 , and 15 % on Day 15 , when a single dose of drug4 500 mg was admini , stered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of drug5 and on Days 4,8 , and 15 . 
Oral drug1 : drug2 , when given once daily for 14 days as a 100-mg capsule with an oral drug3 containing 35 mcg of drug4 and 1 mg of drug5 , decreased the AUC of drug6 by 43 % , and decreased the AUC of drug7 by 8 % ; 
therefore , the efficacy of oral drug1 during administration of drug2 may be reduced . 
Although a 3-day regimen of drug1 given concomitantly with oral drug2 has not been studied , alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be used . 
drug1 : drug2 increased the AUC of drug3 , a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate , by 2.3-fold on Day 1 and 3.3-fold on Day 5 , when a single oral dose of drug4 2 mg was coadministered on Day 1 and Day 5 of a regimen of drug5 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 through 5 . 
The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of drug1 or other drug2 metabolized via CYP3A4 ( drug3 , drug4 ) should be considered when coadministering these agents with drug5 . 
In another study with intravenous administration of drug1 , drug2 was given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 , and drug3 2 mg IV was given prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of drug4 and on Days 4 , 8 , and 15 . 
drug1 increased the AUC of drug2 by 25 % on Day 4 and decreased the AUC of drug3 by 19 % on Day 8 relative to the dosing of drug4 on Days 1 through 3 . 
These effects were not considered clinically important . 
The AUC of drug1 on Day 15 was similar to that observed at baseline . 
Effect of other agents on the pharmacokinefics of drug1 
drug1 is a substrate for CYP3A4 ; 
therefore , coadministration of drug1 with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may result in increased plasma concentrations of drug2 . 
Consequently , concomitant administration of drug1 with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) should be approached with caution . 
Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g. , drug1 ) result in 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of drug2 , concomitant administration should also be approached with caution . 
drug1 is a substrate for CYP3A4 ; 
therefore , coadministration of drug1 with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) may result in reduced plasma concentrations of drug5 that may result in decreased efficacy of drug6 . 
drug1 : When a single 125-mg dose of drug2 was administered on Day5 of a 
drug1 : When a single 125-mg dose of drug2 was administered on Day5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of drug3 , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , the AUC of drug4 increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of drug5 increased approximately 3-fold . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be approached cautiously . 
drug1 : When a single 375-mg dose of drug2 was administered on Day9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of drug3 , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , the AUC of drug4 decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may result in reduced plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of drug2 . 
Additional interactions 
drug1 : In patients with mild to moderate hypertension , administration of drug2 once daily , as a tablet formulation comparable to 230 mg of the capsule formulation , with drug3 120 mg 3 times daily for 5 days , resulted in a 2-fold increase of drug4 AUC and a simultaneous 1.7-fold increase of drug5 AUC . 
These pharmacokinetic effects did not result in clinically meaningful changes in ECG , heart rate or blood pressure beyond those changes induced by drug1 alone . 
drug1 : Coadministration of once daily doses of drug2 , as a tablet formulation comparable to 85 mg or 170 mg of the capsule formulation , with drug3 20 mg once daily , resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25 % and Cmax , by approximately 20 % of both drug4 and drug5 . 
No information provided 
Interactions for drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) : drug6 : drug7 has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of drug8 ; 
as such it may impair intestinal absorption of any of drug1 . 
drug1 / drug2 : The coadministration of drug3 or drug4 will not affect plasma concentrations of drug5 , but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of drug6 /ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism . 
Since blood level of drug1 /ergocalcitriol will be reduced , higher doses of drug2 may be necessary if these drugs are administered simultaneously . 
drug1 : drug2 are known to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of drug3 excretion in urine . 
Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 causes hypercalcemia . 
Therefore , precaution should be taken when coadministration is necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with drug3 , as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias . 
drug1 : drug2 may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of drug3 . 
Reductions in serum endogenous vitamin D concentrations have been observed following the administration of 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day drug1 for a week to healthy men . 
However , in vivo drug interaction studies of drug1 with drug2 have not been investigated . 
drug1 : A relationship of functional antagonism exists between drug2 , which promote calcium absorption , and drug3 , which inhibit calcium absorption . 
Phosphate-Binding Agents : Since drug1 also has an effect on phosphate transport in the intestine , kidneys and bones , the dosage of phosphate-binding agents must be adjusted in accordance with the serum phosphate concentration . 
drug1 : The coadministration of any of the drug2 should be avoided as this could create possible additive effects and hypercalcemia . 
drug1 Supplements : Uncontrolled intake of additional drug2 -containing preparations should be avoided . 
drug1 : drug2 -containing preparations ( eg , drug3 ) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with drug4 by patients on chronic renal dialysis . 
It is not known if drug1 Gel interacts with other topical medications applied to the ulcer site . 
The use of drug1 Gel with other topical drugs has not been studied . 
1 . 
Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 : The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 ( debrisoquin hydroxylase ) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population ( about 7 to 10 % of caucasians are so called poor metabolizers ) ; 
reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian , African and other populations are not yet available . 
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of drug1 ( drug2 ) when given usual doses . 
Depending on the traction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6 , the increase in plasma concentration may be small , or quite large ( 8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the drug1 ) . 
In addition , certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble p.o. 
metabolizers . 
An individual who is stable on a given dose of drug1 may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy . 
The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme ( drug1 ; 
drug1 ) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 ( many other drug2 , drug3 , and the Type 1C antiarrhythrnics propatenone and drug4 ) . 
While all the drug1 ( drug2 ) , e.g. , drug3 , seriraline , and drug4 , inhibit P450 2D6 , they may vary in the extent of inhibition . 
The extent to which drug1 - drug2 interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the drug3 involved . 
Nevertheless , caution is indicated in the co-administration of drug1 with any of the drug2 and also in switching from one class to the other . 
Of particular importance , sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from drug1 , given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite ( at least 5 weeks may be necessary ) . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the drug2 or the other drug . 
Furthermore , whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy , an increased dose of drug1 may be required . 
It is desirable to monitor drug1 plasma levels whenever a drug2 is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 . 
2 . 
Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when this drug is given concomitantly with drug1 or drug2 . 
3 . 
Clinical experience in the concurrent administration of ECT and drug1 is limited . 
Thus , if such treatment is essential , the possibility of increased risk relative to benefits should be considered . 
4 . 
If drug1 is to be combined with other drug2 such as drug3 or drug4 / drug5 , careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of drug6 and drug7 ( e.g. , drug8 or drug9 ) are additive . 
Both the sedative and anticholinergic effects of the drug1 are also additive to those of drug2 . 
5 . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 can produce clinically significant increases in the plasma levels of the drug3 . 
Conversely , decreases in plasma levels of the drug1 have been reported upon discontinuation of drug2 which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the drug3 6 .

Animal toxicology studies showed increased drug1 toxicity when drug2 was included as proof of the formulation . 
Although there was no clinical evidence in the vehicle-controlled studies of drug interactions with systemic drug1 , including drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , the effect of drug5 gel on the steady-state concentrations of these drugs is not known . 
No drug interaction data are available on concomitant administration of drug1 gel and systemic anti-KS agents . 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies with drug1 in adults were conducted with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 . 
No interactions were observed . 
In a multiple dose study of drug1 ( 400 mg once daily for 3 days ) and drug2 ( 20 mg once daily for 3 days ) , a 16 % decrease in the clearance of drug3 was observed . 
The disposition of drug1 was not altered by concomitant drug2 administration . 
Drug-Drug Interactions : No clinically significant drug interactions have been found with drug1 at a low dose , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
There was a small decrease in the clearance of drug1 caused by a 400-mg dose of drug2 ; 
it is possible that larger drug1 doses could have a greater effect . 
The hypotensive effect of drug1 is augmented by that of most other drug2 , including drug3 , negative inotropic agents , and inhaled drug4 . 
drug1 : drug2 , given concomitantly with drug3 or 60 minutes following drug4 administration , decreased drug5 bioavailability by approximately 25 % . 
Thus , concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 should be avoided . 
drug1 : drug2 is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for the metabolism of drug3 . 
In a multiple-dose study , drug1 caused a dose-related increase in the mean elimination half-life of drug2 , thereby decreasing the clearance of drug3 by up to 80 % and leading to a five-fold increase in the AUC and the half-life of drug4 . 
Trough plasma drug1 levels were also 20 % higher when drug2 and drug3 were administered concomitantly . 
drug1 -related adverse effects have occurred in patients consuming drug2 while on therapy with drug3 .

drug1 : Seizures have been reported in patients taking drug2 concomitantly with the drug3 drug4 . 
Animal studies also suggest an increased potential for seizures when these two drugs are given concomitantly . 
drug1 is not approved in the United States at this time . 
drug1 and drug2 : drug3 form chelates with metal cations . 
Therefore , administration of drug1 with drug2 containing drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 ; 
with drug1 ; 
with divalent or trivalent cations such as drug1 ; 
or with drug1 containing drug2 may substantially interfere with drug absorption and result in insufficient plasma and tissue drug3 concentrations . 
drug1 containing drug2 and drug3 reduce the oral absorption of drug4 by 75 % . 
The oral bioavailability of drug1 is reduced by 60 % with coadministration of drug2 . 
These agents should not be taken for 8 hours before or for 2 hours after drug1 administration . 
drug1 : drug2 is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for the metabolism of drug3 . 
drug1 interferes with the metabolism of drug2 resulting in a 42 % to 74 % dose-related decrease in drug3 clearance and a subsequent 260 % to 350 % increase in serum theophylline levels . 
drug1 -related adverse effects have occurred in patients when drug2 and drug3 were coadministered . 
drug1 : drug2 , including drug3 , decrease the clearance of drug4 , the less active isomer of racemic drug5 . 
drug1 does not affect the clearance of the active S-isomer , and changes in clotting time have not been observed when drug2 and drug3 were coadministered . 
Nevertheless , the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be monitored when drug1 or its derivatives and drug2 are given concomitantly . 
Patients receiving other drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , or other drug4 ( including drug5 ) concomitantly with drug6 and drug7 tablets may exhibit an additive CNS depression . 
When combined therapy is contemplated , the dose of one or both agents should be reduced . 
The use of drug1 or drug2 with drug3 preparations may increase the effect of either the drug4 or drug5 . 
The concurrent use of drug1 with drug2 may produce paralytic ileus . 
drug1 use in patients who are receiving high doses of drug2 may be associated with an increase in serum drug3 levels and potential drug4 toxicity . 
In case of drug1 toxicity and/or elevated serum drug2 levels , the dose of drug3 should be reduced while the patient is receiving concomitant drug4 therapy . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 has been reported to result in elevated drug3 serum levels . 
There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when drug1 and oral drug2 were used concomitantly . 
Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of drug1 with various oral anticoagulents may be more pronounced in the elderly . 
Concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 or drug3 has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia . 
drug1 has been reported to decrease the clearance of drug2 and drug3 and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these drug4 . 
The use of drug1 in patients concurrently taking drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these other drugs . 
There have been reports of interactions of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , and drug14 . 
Serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving drug1 .

Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events , including electrocardiographic QT/QTc interval prolongation , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed . 
In addition , deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 . 
There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when drug1 is coadministered with drug2 , resulting in QT prolongation , cardiac arrythmias , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrulation , and torsades de pointes , most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of drug3 by drug4 . 
Fatalities have been reported . 
Patients receiving concomitant drug1 and drug2 should be carefully monitored ; 
cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in seriously ill patients . 
The use of drug1 may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or other drugs that produce CNS depression . 
Serious toxicity may result if drug1 is coadministered with drug2 ( drug3 ) . 
The use of drug1 may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or other drugs that produce CNS depression . 
Preliminary data which suggest that drug1 may inhibit the anti-inflammatory activity of drug2 have not been confirmed . 
If leprosy-associated inflammatory reactions develop in patients being treated with drug1 and drug2 , it is still advisable to continue treatment with both drugs . 
drug1 : As with other drug2 , concomitant administration of drug3 and drug4 is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects . 
drug1 : drug2 have been reported to competitively inhibit drug3 accumulation in rabbit kidney slices . 
This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of drug1 . 
Caution should be used when drug1 are administered concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : Reports suggest that drug2 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug3 . 
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : Clinical studies , as well as post-marketing observations , have shown that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patients . 
This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
During concomitant therapy of drug1 with drug2 , the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure , as well as to assure diuretic efficacy . 
drug1 : drug2 have produced an elevation of plasma drug3 levels and a reduction in renal drug4 clearance . 
The mean minimum drug1 concentration increased 15 % and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20 % . 
These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the drug1 . 
Thus , when drug1 and drug2 are administered concurrently , subjects should be observed carefully for signs of drug3 toxicity . 
drug1 : The effects of drug2 and drug3 on GI bleeding are synergistic , such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone . 
drug1 : In a single dose study ( n=6 ) , ingestion of an drug2 containing 1.7-gram of drug3 with 500-mg of drug4 increased the Cmax and AUC of drug5 by 125 % and 36 % , respectively. A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including drug6 , drug7 and drug8 . 
Drug interaction studies of drug1 and these compounds have not been conducted . 
The possibility of altered safety and efficacy should be considered when drug1 is used concomitantly with these drugs . 
Drug Interactions : The central drug1 syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as drug2 are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions , e.g. , certain drug3 such as drug4 , the drug5 and other drug6 , drug7 , certain drug8 such as the drug9 salts , and drug10 . 
No drug/drug interaction studies have been performed . 
There have been no formal drug-interaction studies performed with drug1 . 
The potential for drug-drug interaction with drugs affected by cytochrome P450 enzymes may not be ruled out . 
Laboratory Test Interactions 
drug1 is not known to interfere with any routine diagnostic tests . 
Interactions for drug1 analogues ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) : drug6 : drug7 has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of drug8 ; 
as such it may impair intestinal absorption of any of drug1 . 
drug1 / drug2 : The coadministration of drug3 or drug4 will not affect plasma concentrations of drug5 , but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of drug6 /ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism . 
Since blood level of drug1 /ergocalcitriol will be reduced , higher doses of drug2 may be necessary if these drugs are administered simultaneously . 
drug1 : drug2 are known to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of calcium excretion in urine . 
Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 causes hypercalcemia . 
Therefore , precaution should be taken when coadministration is necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with drug3 , as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias . 
drug1 : drug2 may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of drug3 . 
Reductions in serum endogenous vitamin D concentrations have been observed following the administration of 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day drug1 for a week to healthy men . 
However , in vivo drug interaction studies of drug1 with drug2 have not been investigated . 
drug1 : A relationship of functional antagonism exists between drug2 analogues , which promote calcium absorption , and drug3 , which inhibit calcium absorption . 
Phosphate-Binding Agents : Since drug1 also has an effect on phosphate transport in the intestine , kidneys and bones , the dosage of phosphate-binding agents must be adjusted in accordance with the serum phosphate concentration . 
drug1 : The coadministration of any of the drug2 analogues should be avoided as this could create possible additive effects and hypercalcemia . 
drug1 Supplements : Uncontrolled intake of additional drug2 -containing preparations should be avoided . 
drug1 : drug2 -containing preparations ( eg , drug3 ) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with drug4 by patients on chronic renal dialysis . 
drug1 and drug2 may decrease hypoprothrombinemic effect . 
Other depressasnts such as drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may enhance CNS depression when administered with drug4 . 
May interact with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Drug/Laboratory Interactions No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with drug1 . 
An immune response to drug1 may interfere with subsequent diagnostic serum tests that utilize drug2 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with drug1 . 
Due to the frequent occurrence of severe and prolonged thrombocytopenia , the potential benefits of medications which interfere with platelet function and/or anticoagulation should be weighed against the potential increased risks of bleeding and hemorrhage . 
Patients receiving medications that interfere with platelet function or coagulation should have more frequent laboratory monitoring for thrombocytopenia . 
In addition , the transfusion practices for such patients may need to be modified given the increased risk of bleeding . 
Patients in clinical studies were prohibited from receiving growth factor treatment for 2 weeks prior to the drug1 therapeutic regimen as well as for 2 weeks following completion of the regimen . 
Because the drug1 have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on drug2 therapy may require downward adjustment of their drug3 dosage . 
Since bacteriostatic drugs , such as the drug1 of drug2 , may interfere with the bactericidal action of drug3 , it is not advisable to administer these drugs concomitantly . 
Concurrent use of drug1 with oral drug2 may render oral drug3 less effective . 
Breakthrough bleeding has been reported 
drug1 : drug2 ( drug3 ) Injection , USP should not be used with drug4 because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure . 
drug1 : drug2 has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm , and its effect could be additive with drug3 ( drug4 ) Injection , USP . 
drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) Injection , USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other . . 
drug1 : Although the results of a clinical study did not indicate a safe problem associated with the administration of drug2 ( drug3 ) Injection , USP to subjects already receiving drug4 , there have been reports that drug5 may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of drug6 by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine . 
drug1 : drug2 may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients , predisposing to a greater ischemic response to drug3 therapy . 
drug1 ( e. g. drug2 and drug3 ) : Agents of the drug4 , of which drug5 ( drug6 ) Injection , USP is a member , have been shown to interact with drug7 of the drug8 , resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction . 
Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of drug1 -containing drugs when co-administered with these drug2 . 
drug1 : Weakness hyperreflexia , and incoordination have been reported rarely when drug2 have been co-administered with drug3 ( e. g . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) . 
There have been no reported cases from spontaneous reports of drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) Injection , USP . 
Oral drug1 : The effect of oral drug2 on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 ( drug4 ) Injection , USP has not been studied . 
The magnitude and relative importance of the effects noted below are likely to be patient specific and may vary by such factors as age , gender , race , intercurrent illnesses , dose of either agent , additional concomitant medications , and timing of drug administration . 
Any agent that alters thyroid hormone synthesis , secretion , distribution , effect on target tissues , metabolism , or elimination may alter the optimal therapeutic dose of drug1 sodium . 
drug1 Absorption : The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of drug2 from the gastrointestinal tract : drug3 , drug4 resin , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , soybean flour ( e.g. , infant formula ) , drug8 . 
Binding to Serum Proteins : The following agents may either inhibit drug1 binding to serum proteins or alter the concentrations of serum binding proteins : drug2 and related drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 and drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 . 
Thyroid Physiology : The following agents may alter thyroid hormone or TSH levels , generally by effects on thyroid hormone synthesis , secretion , distribution , metabolism , hormone action , or elimination , or altered TSH secretion : drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and related anabolic hormones , complex anions ( drug5 , drug6 , drug7 ) , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 and drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , hepatic enzyme inducers , drug18 , iodinated cholestographic agents , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 , drug23 , drug24 , drug25 , drug26 , drug27 , drug28 , drug29 , drug30 , drug31 , drug32 , drug33 , drug34 . 
Adrenocorticoids : Metabolic clearance of adrenocorticoids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients , and may therefore change with changing thyroid status . 
drug1 : drug2 therapy alone can cause hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism . 
drug1 ( Oral ) : The hypoprothrombinemic effect of drug2 may be potentiated , apparently by increased catabloism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 ) : Requirements for drug4 or oral drug5 may be reduced in hypothyroid patients with diabetes mellitus and may subsequently increase with the initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy . 
drug1 : Actions of some of drug2 may be impaired when hypothyroid patients become euthyroid . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 ) : drug4 have been reported to induce both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism . 
drug1 : Therapeutic effects of drug2 may be reduced . 
Serum drug1 levels may be decreased in hyperthyroidism or when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid . 
drug1 : Marked hypertension and tachycardia have been reported in association with concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : Risk of cardiac arrhythmias may increase . 
drug1 ( 123I and 131I ) , drug2 : Uptake of radiolabeled ions may be decreased . 
drug1 / drug2 : Excessive concurrent use of drug3 may accelerate epiphyseal closure . 
Untreated hypothyroidism may interfere with the growth response to drug1 or drug2 . 
drug1 : drug2 clearance may decrease in hypothyroid patients and return toward normal when a euthyroid state is achieved . 
drug1 : Concurrent use may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs , possibly due to increased catecholamine sensitivity . 
Onset of action of drug1 may be accelerated . 
drug1 : Possible increased risk of coronary insufficiency in patients with coronary artery disease . 
In one survey , 2.3 % of patients taking drug1 in combination with drug2 experienced tremor , as compared to 0.7 % reported to occur with drug3 alone . 
The contribution of each of the treatments to this adverse reaction is unknown but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded . 
Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of drug1 in patients with bronchospasm ; 
therefore , doses greater than the normal antiasthmatic dose of drug1 may be required . 
drug1 has been shown to increase the bioavailability of drug2 . 
Since this could be explained either by enhanced absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of drug1 , special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients . 
Synergism has been shown between drug1 anesthesia and intravenously administered drug2 . 
During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using drug1 in association with drug2 , high concentrations ( 3 % or above ) of drug3 should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure . 
The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving drug1 . 
drug1 blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by drug2 without preventing its hypotensive effect . 
If drug1 is used with drug2 in patients with angina pectoris , additional antihypertensive effects may occur . 
Care should be taken if drug1 is used concomitantly with drug2 s of the drug3 type . 
Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction While taking drug1 , patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of drug1 used to treat allergic reaction . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines , metanephrine , normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods . 
In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with drug1 , a specific method , such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction ( e.g. , J Chromatogr 385:241,1987 ) should be employed in determining levels of catecholamines . 
drug1 has also been reported to produce a false positive test for drug2 when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods Toxi-Lab A ( thin-layer chromatographic assay ) and Emit-d.a.u. ( radioenzymatic assay ) . 
When patients being treated with drug1 have a positive urine test for drug2 using these techniques confirmation should be made by using more specific methods such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique . 
The following drug interactions were observed in some patients undergoing treatment with oral drug1 . 
Although the pattern of use for oral drug1 includes longer term therapy , particularly for gout and renal calculi , the experience gained may be relevant . 
drug1 / drug2 : drug3 inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of drug4 and drug5 to drug6 . 
This oxidation , which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase , inactivates drug1 . 
In patients receiving drug1 ( drug2 ) or drug3 ( drug4 ) , the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of drug5 per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of drug6 or drug7 . 
Subsequent adjustment of doses of drug1 or drug2 should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects . 
drug1 : It has been reported that drug2 prolongs the half-life of the drug3 , drug4 . 
The clinical basis of this drug interaction has not been established but should be noted when drug1 is given to patients already on drug2 therapy . 
Consequently , prothrombin time should be reassessed periodically in patients receiving both drugs . 
drug1 : Since the excretion of drug2 is similar to that of urate , drug3 , which increase the excretion of urate , are also likely to increase the excretion of drug4 and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines ( hypoxanthine and xanthine ) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with drug3 alone . 
Although clinical evidence to date has not demonstrated renal precipitation of oxypurines in patients either on drug1 alone or in combination with drug2 , the possibility should be kept in mind . 
drug1 : The reports that the concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 may contribute to the enhancement of drug4 toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation . 
Review of these case reports indicates that the patients were mainly receiving drug1 for hypertension and that tests to rule out decreased renal function secondary to hypertensive nephropathy were not often performed . 
In those patients in whom renal insufficiency was documented , however , the recommendation to lower the dose of drug1 was not followed . 
Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established , current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on drug1 and drug2 even in the absence of renal failure , and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected . . 
drug1 / drug2 : An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving drug3 or drug4 concurrently with drug5 compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs . 
The cause of the reported association has not been established . 
drug1 : Enhanced bone marrow suppression by drug2 and other drug3 has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease , except leukemia , in the presence of drug4 . 
However , in a well-controlled study of patients with lymphoma on combination therapy , drug1 did not increase the marrow toxicity of patients treated with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and/or drug6 . 
drug1 : drug2 s plasma half-life may be prolonged by drug3 , since drug4 and drug5 may compete for excretion in the renal tubule . 
The risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increased if drug1 and drug2 are given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency . 
drug1 : Reports indicate that drug2 levels may be increased during concomitant treatment with drug3 for injection . 
Monitoring of drug1 levels and possible adjustment of drug2 dosage should be considered when these drugs are co-administered . 
drug1 s conversion to inactive metabolites has been shown to be catalyzed by xanthine oxidase from rat liver . 
The clinical significance , if any , of these observations is unknown . 
drug1 generally should not be given with drug2 because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of drug3 toxicity . 
Read circulars for drug1 preparations before use of such concomitant therapy . 
drug1 may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as drug2 and some drug3 . 
Their concurrent use should be avoided . 
A number of drugs , including drug1 , have been shown to displace drug2 from plasma protein ; 
a reduction in the usual drug1 dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs . 
In some patients , the administration of a drug1 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of drug2 , drug3 and drug4 . 
Therefore , when drug1 and drug2 are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the drug3 is obtained . 
drug1 : Several short-term controlled studies failed to wshow that drug2 significantly affected prothrombin times or a variety of other clotting factors when administered to individuals on drug3 . 
However , because bleeding has been reported when drug1 and other drug2 have been administered to patients on drug3 , the physician should be cautious when administering drug4 to patients on drug5 . 
drug1 : Animal studies wshow that drug2 given with drug3 , including drug4 , yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug . 
Single dose bioavailability studies in normal volunteers have failed to wshow an effect of drug1 on drug2 blood levels . 
Correlative clinical studies have not been performed . 
drug1 : drug2 , as well as other drug3 , probably reduces the tubular secretion of drug4 based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices . 
This may indicate that drug1 could enhance the toxicity of drug2 . 
Caution should be used if drug1 is administered concomitantly with drug2 . 
H-2 Antagonists : In studies with human volunteers , co-administration of drug1 or drug2 with drug3 had no substantive effect on drug4 serum concentrations . 
drug1 : Clinical studies , as well as random observations , have shown that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patients . 
This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis . 
During concomitant therapy with drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure , as well as to assure drug2 efficacy . 
drug1 : drug2 produced an elevation of plasma drug3 levels and a reduction in renal drug4 clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteers . 
The mean minimum drug1 concentration increased 15 % and the renal clearance of drug2 was decreased by 19 % during this period of concomitant drug administration . 
This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by drug1 . 
Thus , when drug1 and drug2 are administered concurrently , subjects should be observed carefully for signs of drug3 toxicity . 
( Read circulars for drug1 preparation before use of such concurrent therapy ) . 
Renal clearance measurements of drug1 cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
These compounds interfere with chemical color development essential to the analytical procedures . 
drug1 depresses tubular secretion of certain weak acids such as drug2 . 
Therefore , patients receiving drug1 will have erroneously low ERPF and Tm drug2 values . 
drug1 should not be administered concomitantly with potent drug2 such as drug3 and drug4 as the potential for ototoxicity is enhanced by the combination . 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with drug1 . 
The concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving drug3 alone . 
It is not known whether this potentiation of drug1 rashes is due to drug2 or the hyperuricemia present in these patients . 
In controlled clinical trials of drug1 , 22 patients received concomitant drug2 and drug3 . 
No rashes were reported in these patients . 
However , this sample size is too small to allow for any conclusions to be drawn regarding the risk of rashes with concomitant drug1 and drug2 use . 
In common with other drug1 , drug2 may reduce the efficacy of oral drug3 
drug1 ( drug2 - or drug3 -containing ) : Concomitant administration of 300-mg drug4 capsules with 30 mL drug5 suspension reduces the rate ( Cmax ) and extent ( AUC ) of absorption by approximately 40 % . 
Time to reach Cmax is also prolonged by 1 hour . 
There are no significant effects on drug1 pharmacokinetics if the drug2 is administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after drug3 . 
If drug1 are required during drug2 therapy , drug3 should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the drug4 . 
drug1 : As with other drug2 , drug3 inhibits the renal excretion of drug4 , resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54 % increase in peak drug5 plasma levels , and a 50 % prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life . 
drug1 and Foods Fortified With drug2 Concomitant administration of drug3 with a therapeutic drug4 containing 60 mg of elemental drug5 ( as FeSO4 ) or drug6 supplemented with 10 mg of elemental drug7 reduced extent of absorption by 80 % and 31 % , respectively . 
If drug1 are required during drug2 therapy , drug3 should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement . 
The effect of foods highly fortified with elemental drug1 ( primarily drug2 -fortified breakfast cereals ) on drug3 absorption has not been studied . 
Concomitantly administered drug1 -fortified infant formula ( 2.2 mg elemental drug2 /6 oz ) has no significant effect on drug3 pharmacokinetics . 
Therefore , drug1 for Oral Suspension can be administered with drug2 -fortified infant formula . 
There have been rare reports of reddish stools in patients who have received drug1 in Japan . 
The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between drug1 or its breakdown products and drug2 in the gastrointestinal tract . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using drug1 , but not with those using drug2 . 
The administration of drug1 may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in urine using Clinitest , Benedict s solution , or Fehlings solution . 
It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions ( such as Clinistix or Tes-Tape ) be used . 
drug1 are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs test .

Catecholamine-depleting drugs , e.g. , drug1 , may have an additive effect when given with drug2 . 
Patients treated concurrently with drug1 ( drug2 ) and a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may result in vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
A study of interaction between drug1 and drug2 showed that concomitant administration of drug3 and drug4 does not alter drug5 plasma levels . 
drug1 concentrations were equivocally higher when given with drug2 , but this is not likely to be clinically important . 
When drug1 and drug2 were concomitantly administered intravenously to normal volunteers , there was a 10-20 % increase in drug3 blood levels at some time points . 
drug1 did not affect drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
When intravenous drug1 and drug2 were concomitantly administered in normal subjects , no effect on drug3 blood levels was seen , but drug4 steady-state blood levels were increased by 46 % in the presence of drug5 . 
No other pharmacokinetic parameters were changed . 
The effect of drug1 on the duration of drug2 -induced neuromuscular blockade was studied in patients undergoing surgery . 
The onset of neuromuscular blockade by drug1 was unaffected by drug2 , but the duration of neuromuscular blockade was prolonged from 5 minutes to 8 minutes . 
Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance , drug1 should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 . 
While taking drug1 , patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of drug1 used to treat allergic reaction . 
Caution should be exercised when considering the use of drug1 and drug2 in patients with depressed myocardial function . 
Fatal cardiac arrests have occurred in patients receiving both drugs . 
Additionally , drug1 should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high . 
In patients receiving nonselective drug1 ( drug2 ) ( e.g. , drug3 ) in combination with drug4 ( e.g. , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 ) , there have been reports of serious , sometimes fatal , reactions . 
Because drug1 is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor , drug2 should not be used concomitantly with a drug3 . 
At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a drug1 and initiation of treatment with drug2 . 
At least 3 weeks should elapse between discontinuation of drug1 and initiation of treatment with a drug2 . 
A rare , but serious , constellation of symptoms , termed serotonin syndrome , has been reported with the concomitant use of drug1 ( drug2 ) and agents for migraine therapy , such as drug3 ( drug4 ) and drug5 . 
The syndrome requires immediate medical attention and may include one or more of the following symptoms : excitement , hypomania , restlessness , loss of consciousness , confusion , disorientation , anxiety , agitation , motor weakness , myoclonus , tremor , hemiballismus , hyperreflexia , ataxia , dysarthria , incoordination , hyperthermia , shivering , pupillary dilation , diaphoresis , emesis , and tachycardia . 
drug1 should not be administered with other drug2 . 
The appropriate interval between administration of these agents and drug1 has not been established . 
The use of drug1 with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated ; 
consequently , caution is advised if drug1 and such drugs are prescribed concurrently . 
drug1 is highly bound to plasma protein ( 99.9 % ) . 
Therefore , caution should be used when administering drug1 concurrently with other highly plasma protein- bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices , as competition for binding sites may occur . 
The extent of plasma protein binding of drug1 in human plasma is not affected by the presence of therapeutic concentrations of drug2 ( 15 mcg/ mL ) , nor is the binding of drug3 affected by the presence of drug4 . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 and drug3 Suspension results in a significant decrease in average steady- state plasma drug4 concentrations . 
Alternatives to drug1 should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with drug2 . 
drug1 , another drug2 , is structurally similar to drug3 and may possibly have some of the same drug interactions as drug4 . 
No interaction trials have been conducted with drug1 and drug2 . 
Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions : It is not known if drug1 interferes with clinical laboratory test or assay results . 
Medications that interfere with your bodys ability to use folate may also increase the need for this drug1 . 
Medications can interfere with folate utilization , including : drug1 ( such as drug2 , and drug3 ) drug4 ( sometimes prescribed to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes ) drug5 ( used to control inflammation associated with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis ) drug6 ( a drug7 ) drug8 There has been concern about the interaction between drug9 and drug10 . 
drug1 supplements can correct the anemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency . 
Unfortunately , drug1 will not correct changes in the nervous system that result from vitamin B12 deficiency . 
Permanent nerve damage could theoretically occur if vitamin B12 deficiency is not treated . 
Therefore , intake of supplemental drug1 should not exceed 1000 micrograms ( g , sometimes mcg ) per day to prevent drug2 from masking symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency . 
It is important for older adults to be aware of the relationship between drug1 and drug2 because they are at greater risk of having a vitamin B12 deficiency . 
If you are 50 years of age or older , ask your physician to check your B12 status before you take a supplement that contains drug1 . 
Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions . 
Due to a theoretical risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction , use of drug1 -containing or drug2 ( like drug3 or drug4 ) and drug5 within 24 hours of each other should be avoided ( see a href= frova_od.htm # CI CONTRAINDICATIONS ) . 
Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists within 24 hours of drug1 treatment is not recommended . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) have been reported , rarely , to cause weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination when coadministered with drug7 . 
If concomitant treatment with drug1 and an drug2 is clinically warranted , appropriate observation of the patient is advised . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests . 
Elevated plasma levels of drug1 have been reported with concomitant drug2 use . 
There have been reports of drug1 -related side effects in patients on concomitant therapy with drug2 and drug3 . 
Therefore , monitoring of drug1 plasma levels should be considered and dosage of drug2 adjusted , as required . 
drug1 have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of drug2 . 
This may lead to reduced clearance of drug1 and the prolongation of its plasma half-life . 
drug1 , including drug2 , may enhance the effects of the oral drug3 drug4 or its derivatives . 
When these products are administered concomitantly , prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored . 
drug1 interferes with the therapeutic action of drug2 . 
drug1 containing drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 ; 
drug1 or divalent or trivalent cations such as drug2 ; 
drug1 containing drug2 ; 
and drug1 , ( drug2 ) , chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may substantially interfere with the absorption of drug3 , resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired . 
These agents should not be taken within the two hour period before or within the two-hour period after drug1 administration . 
Elevated serum levels of drug1 have been reported with the concomitant use of some drug2 and drug3 . 
Therefore , drug1 serum levels should be monitored and appropriate drug2 dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly . 
drug1 when used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs may show on-treatment additive toxicity , especially hematologic and gastrointestinal effects . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure ( e.g. , drug2 ) , requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment . 
There are few data regarding the coadministration of radiation therapy and drug1 . 
In adjuvant trials of drug1 -containing CEF-120 or FEC-100 chemotherapies , breast irradiation was delayed until after chemotherapy was completed . 
This practice resulted in no apparent increase in local breast cancer recurrence relative to published accounts in the literature . 
A small number of patients received drug1 -based chemotherapy concomitantly with radiation therapy but had chemotherapy interrupted in order to avoid potential overlapping toxicities . 
It is likely that use of drug1 with radiotherapy may sensitize tissues to the cytotoxic actions of irradiation . 
Administration of drug1 after previous radiation therapy may induce an inflammatory recall reaction at the site of the irradiation . 
drug1 is extensively metabolized by the liver . 
Changes in hepatic function induced by concomitant therapies may affect drug1 metabolism , pharmacokinetics , therapeutic efficacy , and/or toxicity . 
drug1 increased the AUC of drug2 by 50 % . 
drug1 treatment should be stopped during treatment with drug2 . 
Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions There are no known interactions between drug1 and laboratory tests . 
drug1 and drug2 : drug3 and drug4 can reduce absorption of drug5 ; 
an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and drug1 should be observed . 
drug1 : drug2 can inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , increasing its plasma level . 
Concomitant use of drug1 should be avoided . 
drug1 : In a study of healthy volunteers , drug2 significantly reduced the bioavailability of drug3 . 
An interval of at least two hours between intake of this agent and drug1 should be observed . 
drug1 : After introduction of drug2 ( oral form ) , a sudden increase in serum drug3 level has been reported . 
Therefore , close monitoring of serum drug1 level is recommended and , if necessary , drug2 should be discontinued . 
Intravenous drug1 was shown to double the bioavailability of oral drug2 . 
The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether similar increases will occur in patients given oral drug1 is unknown ; 
no other specific drug interaction studies were performed . 
Products containing drug1 and other drug2 likely will interfere with absorption of drug3 . 
drug1 is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system , specifically through the CYP3A and CYP2C19 isozymes . 
Studies have shown that drug1 does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , or drug11 in healthy subjects . 
These compounds are metabolized through various cytochrome P450 isozymes including CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A . 
When drug1 was administered concomitantly with drug2 ( CYP1A2 , CYP3A ) , a minor increase ( 10 % ) in the clearance of drug3 was seen . 
Because the small magnitude and the direction of the effect on drug1 clearance , this interaction is unlikely to be clinical concern . 
Nonetheless , individual patients may require additional titration of their drug1 dosage when drug2 is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels . 
drug1 has also been shown to have no clinically significant interaction with drug2 . 
In a single-dose crossover study examining drug1 30 mg and drug2 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with drug3 1 gram , absorption of the drug4 was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17 % and 16 % , respectively , when administered concomitantly with drug5 . 
Therefore , drug1 should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to drug2 . 
In clinical trials , drug1 were administered concomitantly with drug2 delayed-release capsules ; 
this did not interfere with its effect . 
drug1 causes a profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion ; 
therefore , it is theoretically possible that drug1 may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability ( e.g. drug2 , drug3 esters , drug4 salts , drug5 ) . 
APRD00513_IN , txt 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with drug1 . 
Due to its potential to cause neutropenia and lymphopenia , proper monitoring of patients is required if drug1 is given in combination with myelosuppressive agents . 
Also , the potential for hepatic injury should be considered when drug1 is used in combination with other products associated with hepatic injury , or when new agents are added to the regimen of patients already on drug2 . 
The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from controlled clinical trials and studies involving otherwise healthy adults with epilepsy . 
Use in Conjunction with Other drug1 : The addition of drug2 to drug3 ( drug4 ) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of drug5 . 
The net effect of these interactions is summarized in the following table : drug1 drug2 drug3

Specific Effects of drug1 on Other drug2 drug3 : drug4 causes an increase in steady-state drug5 plasma concentrations . 
In 10 otherwise healthy subjects with epilepsy ingesting drug1 , the steadystate trough ( Cmin ) drug2 plasma concentration was 17 5 micrograms/mL . 
The steady-state Cmin increased to 21 5 micrograms/mL when 1200 mg/day of drug1 was coadministered . 
Increasing the drug1 dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state drug2 Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL . 
In order to maintain drug1 levels , limit adverse experiences , and achieve the drug2 dose of 3600 mg/day , a drug3 dose reduction of approximately 40 % was necessary for eight of these 10 subjects . 
In a controlled clinical trial , a 20 % reduction of the drug1 dose at the initiation of drug2 therapy resulted in drug3 levels comparable to those prior to drug4 administration . 
drug1 : drug2 causes a decrease in the steady-state drug3 plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state drug4 plasma concentration . 
In nine otherwise healthy subjects with epilepsy ingesting drug1 , the steady-state trough ( Cmin ) drug2 concentration was 8 2 micrograms/mL . 
The drug1 steady-state Cmin decreased 31 % to 5 1 micrograms/mL when drug2 ( 3000 mg/day , divided into three doses ) was coadministered . 
drug1 steady-state Cmin concentrations increased 57 % from 1.0 0.3 to 1.6 0.4 micrograms/mL with the addition of drug2 . 
In clinical trials , similar changes in drug1 and drug2 were seen . 
drug1 : drug2 causes an increase in steady-state drug3 concentrations . 
In four subjects with epilepsy ingesting drug1 , the steady-state trough ( Cmin ) drug2 plasma concentration was 63 16 micrograms/mL . 
The steady-state Cmin increased to 78 14 micrograms/mL when 1200 mg/day of drug1 was coadministered . 
Increasing the drug1 dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate drug2 Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL . 
Corresponding values for free drug1 Cmin concentrations were 7 3 , 9 4 , and 11 6 micrograms/mL for 0 , 1200 , and 2400 mg/day drug2 , respectively . 
The ratios of the AUCs of unbound drug1 to the AUCs of the total drug2 were 11.1 % , 13.0 % , and 11.5 % , with coadministration of 0 , 1200 , and 2400 mg/day of drug3 , respectively . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 with drug3 causes an increase in drug4 plasma concentrations , In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting drug5 , the steady-state trough ( Cmin ) drug6 concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL . 
The steady-state Cmin concentration increased to 17.8 micrograms/mL when 2400 mg/day of drug1 was coadministered for one week . 
Effects of Other drug1 on drug2 drug3 : drug4 causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of drug5 ( drug6 ) at steady state and , therefore , the addition of drug7 causes an approximate 45 % decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of drug8 as compared to the same dose of drug9 given as monotherapy . 
drug1 : drug2 causes an approximate 50 % increase in the clearance of drug3 at steady state and , therefore , the addition of drug4 results in an approximate 40 % decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of drug5 as compared to the same dose of drug6 given as monotherapy . 
drug1 : Available data suggest that there is no significant effect of drug2 on the clearance of drug3 at steady state , Therefore , the addition of drug4 is not expected to cause a clinically important effect on drug5 ( drug6 ) plasma concentrations . 
drug1 : It appears that drug2 may reduce plasma drug3 concentrations . 
Steady-state plasma drug1 concentrations were found to be 29 % lower than the mean concentrations of a group of newly diagnosed subjects with epilepsy also receiving 2400 mg of drug2 a day . 
Effects of drug1 on drug2 The rate and extent of absorption of a 2400 mg dose of drug3 as monotherapy given as tablets was not affected when coadministered with drug4 . 
Effects of drug1 on drug2 The coadministration of drug3 ( 1000 mg/day ) for 10 days did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax , Cmin , AUC , CI/kg or tmax at drug4 daily doses of 3000 or 3600 mg/day in 10 otherwise healthy subjects with epilepsy . 
Effects of drug1 on Low-Dose drug2 A group of 24 nonsmoking , healthy white female volunteers established on an oral drug3 regimen containing 30 mg drug4 and 75 mg drug5 for at least 3 months received 2400 mg/day of drug6 from midcycle ( day 15 ) to midcycle ( day 14 ) of two consecutive oral drug7 cycles . 
drug1 treatment resulted in a 42 % decrease in the drug2 AUC 0-24 , but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug3 . 
No volunteer showed hormonal evidence of ovulation , but one volunteer reported intermenstrual bleeding during drug1 treatment . 
drug1 is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A4 , but coadministration of drug2 , a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4 , has no significant effect on drug3 pharmacokinetics . 
Significant pharmacokinetic interactions mediated by inhibition of CYP isoenzymes therefore appear unlikely . 
Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or St. John s wort ) may significantly decrease exposure to drug5 . 
Dose modification is recommended for patients who are also receiving a potent CYP 3A4 inducer . 
Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions No clinically relevant changes in the results of clinical laboratory tests have been observed . 
No drug , nutritional supplement , food or herb interactions have yet been reported . 
drug1 is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system . 
drug1 inhibits CYP3A4 . 
Caution should be used when coadministering medications that are substrates , inhibitors , or inducers of CYP3A4 , or potentially toxic medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 . 
drug1 does not inhibit CYP2D6 , CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2E1 , or uridine glucuronosyltransferase ( UDPGT ) . 
drug1 : The effect of drug2 on total drug concentrations of other drug3 in subjects receiving both agents was evaluated using comparisons to historical data . 
drug1 steady-state Cmax , A.C. and Cmin were decreased by 22 % , 38 % , and 27 % , respectively , by concomitant drug2 . 
Similar decreases in Cmax and AUC were seen after the first dose . 
drug1 steady-state Cmax , A.C. and Cmin were increased 21 % , decreased 19 % , and decreased 48 % , respectively , by concomitant drug2 . 
drug1 steady-state Cmax , A.C. and Cmin were increased by 12 % , 15 % , and 14 % , respectively , by concomitant drug2 . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 and drug3 can decrease plasma levels of drug4 . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drug2 as compared to a non-matched historicalcontrol group resulted in a 30 % , 27 % , and 25 % decrease in serum drug3 AUC , Cmax , andCmin , respectively . 
drug1 is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 C.P.A. metabolism and therefore should not be administered concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4 . 
There are other agents that may result in serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions . 
Laboratory Tests : The combination of drug1 and low-dose drug2 has been associated with elevations of cholesterol and triglycerides , SGOT ( AST ) , and SGPT ( ALT ) in some patients . 
Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with drug1 and drug2 and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy . 
For comprehensive information concerning laboratory test alterations associated with drug1 , physicians should refer to the complete prescribing information for drug2 ( drug3 ) . 
In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the potential of drug1 to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , and CYP3A4 ) that mediate drug and xenobiotic metabolism using isoform selective marker substrates and human liver microsomal preparations . 
Only at the highest concentration tested ( 171 
g/mL ; 
1 mM ) was a slight degree of inhibition ( 14 % -30 % ) of isoform CYP2A6 observed . 
No inhibition of any of the other isoforms tested was observed at drug1 concentrations up to 171 mg/mL ( approximately 15 times the Cmax at 3600 mg/day ) . 
drug1 is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly coadministered drug2 . 
The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from studies involving healthy adults and adult patients with epilepsy . 
drug1 : In a single ( 400 mg ) and multiple dose ( 400 mg TID ) study of drug2 in epileptic patients ( N=8 ) maintained on drug3 monotherapy for at least 2 months , drug4 had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of drug5 and drug6 had no effect on drug7 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 : Steady-state trough plasma drug2 and drug3 concentrations were not affected by concomitant drug4 ( 400 mg TID ; 
N=12 ) administration . 
Likewise , drug1 pharmacokinetics were unaltered by drug2 administration . 
drug1 : The mean steady-state trough serum drug2 concentrations prior to and during concomitant drug3 administration ( 400 mg TID ; 
N=17 ) were not different and neither were drug1 pharmacokinetic parameters affected by drug2 . 
drug1 : Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for drug2 or drug3 ( 300 mg TID ; 
N=12 ) are identical whether the drugs are administered alone or together . 
drug1 : Coadministration ( N=18 ) of drug2 capsules ( 250 mg ) with drug3 ( 125 mg ) appears to increase the amount of drug4 absorbed by 12 % to 15 % . 
drug1 had no effect on drug2 pharmacokinetic parameters . 
These doses are lower than the therapeutic doses for both drugs . 
The magnitude of interaction within the recommended dose ranges of either drug is not known . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 ( 125 to 500 mg ; 
N=48 ) decreases drug1 ( 10 mg ; 
N=50 ) Cmax and AUC values in a dose-dependent manner relative to administration of drug1 alone ; 
Cmax and AUC values are 3 % to 4 % lower , respectively , after administration of 125 mg drug1 and 21 % to 22 % lower , respectively , after administration of 500 mg drug2 . 
The mechanism for this interaction is unknown . 
drug1 increases drug2 AUC values by 14 % . 
The magnitude of interaction at other doses is not known . 
drug1 : A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release drug2 capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg drug3 capsule ( N=12 ) , mean drug4 AUC increased by 44 % compared to drug5 administered without drug6 . 
drug1 pharmacokinetic parameter values were not affected by administration of drug2 2 hours after drug3 . 
The magnitude of interaction at other doses is not known . 
drug1 : In the presence of drug2 at 300 mg QID ( N=12 ) the mean apparent oral clearance of drug3 fell by 14 % and creatinine clearance fell by 10 % . 
Thus drug1 appeared to alter the renal excretion of both drug2 and creatinine , an endogenous marker of renal function . 
This small decrease in excretion of drug1 by drug2 is not expected to be of clinical importance . 
The effect of drug1 on drug2 was not evaluated . 
Oral drug1 : Based on AUC and half-life , multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of drug2 and drug3 following administration of tablets containing 2.5 mg of drug4 and 50 mcg of drug5 were similar with and without coadministration of drug6 ( 400 mg TID ; 
N=13 ) . 
The Cmax of drug1 was 13 % higher when it was coadministered with drug2 ; 
this interaction is not expected to be of clinical importance . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : drug3 reduced the bioavailability of drug4 ( N=16 ) by about 20 % . 
This decrease in bioavailability was about 5 % when drug1 was administered 2 hours after drug2 . 
It is recommended that drug1 be taken at least 2 hours following drug2 administration . 
Effect of drug1 : drug2 is a blocker of renal tubular secretion . 
drug1 pharmacokinetic parameters without and with drug2 were comparable . 
This indicates that drug1 does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by drug2 . 
Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG dipstick test for urinary protein when drug1 was added to other drug2 , the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
drug1 may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with drug2 therapy . 
drug1 Supplements/ drug2 
Products containing drug1 and other multivalent cations ( such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) are likely to interfere with absorption of drug5 . 
drug1 should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations ( including drug2 , supplements or drug3 ) . 
drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) 
Of over 3500 patients enrolled in the drug1 osteoporosis Treatment and Prevention Studies , 15 % used anti-peptic agents ( primarily drug2 and drug3 ) . 
Among these patients , the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences in the patients treated with drug1 was similar to that in placebo-treated patients . 
Similarly , of over 1600 patients enrolled in a study comparing once-monthly with daily dosing regimens of drug1 , 14 % of patients used anti-peptic agents . 
Among these patients , the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences in the patients treated with drug1 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated with drug2 2.5 mg once daily . 
drug1 / drug2 s ( drug3 ) 
In the large , placebo-controlled osteoporosis Treatment Study , drug1 and drug2 were taken by 62 % of the 2946 patients . 
Among drug1 or drug2 users , the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events in patients treated with drug3 2.5 mg daily ( 28.9 % ) was similar to that in placebo-treated patients ( 30.7 % ) . 
Similarly , in the 1-year monthly comparison study , drug1 and drug2 were taken by 39 % of the 1602 patients . 
The incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in patients concomitantly taking drug1 or drug2 was similar in patients taking drug3 2.5 mg daily ( 21.7 % ) and 150 mg once monthly ( 22.0 % ) . 
However , since drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation , caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of drug4 or drug5 with drug6 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions 
drug1 are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents . 
Specific studies with drug1 have not been performed . 
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition : drug1 is a reversible , nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase . 
Therefore , drug1 has the potential for interaction with drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : Some individuals receiving drug2 may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting drug3 , drug4 or drug5 . 
Commonly used drugs such as drug1 and drug2 have been specifically studied . 
Initial doses of drug1 , such as drug2 or drug3 , should be reduced and titrated to achieve the desired response . 
drug1 : Co-administration of drug2 and drug3 was not associated with serotonin syndrome in Phase 1 , 2 or 3 studies . 
Spontaneous reports of serotonin syndrome associated with co-administration of drug1 and drug2 , including drug3 such as drug4 ( drug5 ) , have been reported . 
Patients who are treated with drug1 and concomitant drug2 should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome ( e.g. , cognitive dysfunction , hyperpyrexia , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) . 
If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents ( drug1 or concomitant drug2 ) . 
Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions There are no reported drug-laboratory test interactions . 
Increases in prothrombin time have been noted in patients receiving long- term drug1 therapy after drug2 was initiated . 
Therefore , close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the drug1 dose may be necessary when drug2 Capsules are administered concomitantly with drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 may decrease the effects of drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
drug1 : Has a synergistic effect with drug2 in causing gastrointestinal bleeding . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration with drug2 may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate levels . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , and possibly drug4 ) : Concomitant administration with drug5 may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration . 
drug1 Agents : drug2 is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to drug3 agents . 
Urinary Alkalinizers : Decrease drug1 effectiveness by increasing the rate of drug2 renal excretion . 
drug1 : Decreases drug2 effectiveness by enzyme induction . 
drug1 : Serum drug2 levels may be increased by drug3 . 
drug1 : May decrease drug2 anti-inflammatory action by competing for the same receptors . 
drug1 : Enteric Coated drug2 should not be given concurrently with drug3 , since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets . 
The use of drug1 FOR INJECTION in combination with drug2 is not recommended due to the risk of severe pulmonary toxicity . 
No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions have been observed with drugs likely to be co-administered with drug1 . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 supplements , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , and drug14 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests ( Benedict s or Fehling s solution or with Clinitest tablets ) but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria . 
As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test , it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood plasma glucose levels in patients receiving drug1 . 
drug1 does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method . 
drug1 prolong and intensify the effects of drug2 . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or other drug5 may have an additive effect . 
When drug1 are given to patients receiving drug2 , hypertensive reactions , including hypertensive crises , may occur . 
The antihypertensive effects of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 may be reduced by drug5 . 
drug1 may also interact with drug2 . 
Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when drug1 is used concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 increase the rate of absorption of drug2 , while drug3 decreases it . 
Co-administration with drug1 such as drug2 or drug3 is not recommended . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 ( consider drug4 dose reduction ) . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ( exercise caution ) . 
drug1 are a major contributing factor to drug2 toxicity . 
drug1 , particularly if administered rapidly by the intravenous route , may produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 raise the serum drug9 concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug , with the implication that drug10 intoxication may result . 
drug1 and drug2 ( and possibly other drug3 ) and drug4 may increase drug5 absorption in patients who inactivate drug6 by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine , so that drug7 intoxication may result . 
The risk of this interaction may be reduced if drug1 is given as capsules . 
drug1 and drug2 , by decreasing gut motility , may increase drug3 absorption . 
drug1 , drug2 -pectin , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , certain anticancer drugs , and drug6 may interfere with intestinal drug7 absorption , resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations . 
drug1 may decrease serum drug2 concentration , especially in patients with renal dysfunction , by increasing the non-renal clearance of drug3 . 
There have been inconsistent reports regarding the effects of other drugs ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 ) on serum drug3 concentration . 
drug1 administration to a digitalized , hypothyroid patient may increase the dose requirement of drug2 . 
Concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias . 
drug1 may cause a sudden extrusion of potassium from muscle cells , and may thereby cause arrhythmias in digitalized patients . 
Although drug1 or drug2 and drug3 may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation , their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block . 
Due to the considerable variability of these interactions , the dosage of drug1 should be individualized when patients receive these medications concurrently . 
Furthermore , caution should be exercised when combining drug1 with any drug that may cause a significant deterioration in renal function , since a decline in glomerular filtration or tubular secretion may impair the excretion of drug2 . 
Drug interactions with drug1 tablets USP have not been documented . 
Administration of drug1 to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with drug2 may cause hypercalcemia . 
drug1 , a drug2 , has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of drug3 by competitive inhibition . 
Drugs which impair glomerular filtration may prolong the biological half-life of drug1 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : Measurement of serum creatinine levels should be determined by the Jaffe reaction , since drug1 does not interfere with the determination of creatinine values by this method . 
Most automated equipment for measurement of creatinine makes use of the Jaffe reaction . 
- drug1 may enhance the CNS depressive effects of drug2 , drug3 and other drug4 
. 
- drug1 may enhance the effects of drug2 therapy 
. 
- Concomitant use of drug1 may reduce the efficacy of drug2 . 
In vitro studies of human CYP enzymes showed that drug1 inhibited the CYP enzymes 1A2 , 2A6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 and 3A only at very high concentrations ( IC50 from 200 to over 1000 uM ; 
an oral 200 mg dose achieves a highest level of approximately 5 uM in people ) ; 
these enzymes would therefore not be expected to be inhibited in clinical use . 
Protein Binding : drug1 is highly protein bound ( 98 % ) . 
In vitro studies have shown no binding displacement between drug1 and other highly bound drugs , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Drugs Metabolized by Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) : Hormone levels : drug1 is known to depress prolactin secretion and increase growth hormone levels . 
Treatment with drug1 coadministered with drug2 / drug3 does not change these effects . 
No interaction was noted with the drug1 drug2 in two multiple-dose interaction studies when drug3 was coadministered with a drug4 / drug5 ( n=29 ) . 
More than 600 Parkinsons disease patients in clinical trials have used drug1 in combination with drug2 and drug3 / drug4 . 
As most drug1 excretion is via the bile , caution should be exercised when drugs known to interfere with biliary excretion , glucuronidation , and intestinal beta-glucuronidase are given concurrently with drug2 . 
These include drug1 , drug2 , and some drug3 ( e.g. drug4 , rifamipicin , drug5 and drug6 ) . 
No interaction with the drug1 drug2 was shown in a single-dose study with drug3 without coadministered drug4 / drug5 . 
Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor drug1 increases drug2 AUC by 2/3 . 
Caution should be used when administering or taking drug1 with drug2 and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as , but not limited to , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ( drug13 ) , and drug14 . 
Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer drug1 decreased drug2 AUC by about 2/3 . 
Alternate treatments lacking CYP3A4 inducing activity should be considered . 
If an alternative treatment is unavailable , a drug1 dose greater than 150 mg should be considered for NSCLC patients , and greater than 100 mg considered for pancreatic cancer patients . 
If the drug1 dose is adjusted upward , the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of drug2 or other inducers . 
Other CYP3A4 inducers include , but are not limited to , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and St. Johns Wort . 
Hepatotoxicity Asymptomatic increases in liver transaminases have been observed in drug1 treated patients ; 
therefore , periodic liver function testing ( transaminases , bilirubin , and alkaline phosphatase ) should be considered . 
Dose reduction or interruption of drug1 should be considered if changes in liver function are severe . 
Patients with Hepatic Impairment In vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that drug1 is cleared primarily by the liver . 
Therefore , drug1 exposure may be increased in patients with hepatic dysfunction . 
Elevated International Normalized Ratio and Potential Bleeding International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) elevations and infrequent reports of bleeding events including gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal bleedings have been reported in clinical studies , some associated with concomitant drug1 administration . 
Patients taking drug1 or other drug2 should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR 
.

drug1 may decrease the effectiveness of oral drug2 , certain drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
drug1 is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system . 
Coadministration of drug1 Tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects . 
Therefore , unless otherwise specified , appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary . 
The following drug interactions have been identified involving drug1 Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system : drug2 tablets inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , resulting in an increased plasma concentration of drug4 and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite . 
The increased plasma concentration of drug1 or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals . 
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral drug1 inhibits the metabolism of drug2 , resulting in elevated plasma levels of drug3 and its active metabolite drug4 which may prolong QT intervals . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 tablets is therefore contraindicated . 
Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral drug1 potently inhibits the metabolism of drug2 resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of drug3 . 
Data suggest that coadministration of oral drug1 and drug2 can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG . 
Therefore concomitant administration of drug1 tablets with drug2 is contraindicated . 
drug1 tablets may alter the metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs . 
Dosage adjustment may be required if drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 are given concomitantly with drug4 Tablets . 
Coadministration of drug1 Tablets with drug2 or drug3 has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs . 
This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects , especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents . 
These agents should not be used in patients treated with drug1 Tablets . 
If drug1 is administered parenterally , special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged . 
Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of drug1 have been reported . 
It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy . 
It is , therefore , advisable to monitor drug1 concentrations in patients receiving drug2 . 
When taken orally , drug1 like drug2 may enhance the anticoagulant effect of drug3 -like drugs . 
In simultaneous treatment with drug1 and drug2 , the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored . 
Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral drug1 ( an drug2 ) and oral drug3 , such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with drug4 tablets ( an drug5 ) can not be ruled out . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 tablets with drug2 may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs . 
It is suggested to monitor both drug1 and drug2 . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) is also reported to affect drug3 concentrations adversely . 
These drugs should not be given concomitantly . 
After the coadministration of 200 mg oral drug1 twice daily and one 20 mg dose of drug2 to 11 subjects , the AUC and Cmax of drug3 averaged 302 % ( 142 S.D. ) and 251 % ( 68 S.D. ) , respectively , of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo . 
The AUC and Cmax of drug1 , an active metabolite , averaged 155 % ( 27 S.D. ) and 141 % ( 35 S.D. ) , respectively . 
However , no related changes were noted in the QT0 on ECG taken at 2 , 6 , and 24 hours after the coadministration . 
Also , there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when drug1 was administered with or without drug2 . 
Rare cases of a disulfiram-like reaction to drug1 have been reported . 
These experiences have been characterized by flushing , rash , peripheral edema , nausea , and headache . 
Symptoms resolved within a few hours . 
The daily dose of drug1 should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 and nefazadone ) . 
Caution should be taken when drug1 is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window , such as drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) . 
The concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth , constipation , blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects . 
drug1 may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to effects on gastrointestinal motility . 
Drug Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between drug1 and laboratory tests have not been studied . 
In vitro drug metabolism studies indicate that drug1 is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2C9 ( 70 % ) and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 ( 30 % ) . 
drug1 is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of drug2 . 
Inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolic reactions was not detected in in vitro experiments . 
drug1 : In a randomized , multiple-dose crossover study , patients with Type 2 diabetes were administered 120 mg drug2 three times a day before meals for 1 day in combination with drug3 10 mg daily . 
There were no clinically relevant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of either agent . 
drug1 : When drug2 120 mg three times daily before meals was administered in combination with drug3 500 mg three times daily to patients with Type 2 diabetes , there were no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either agent . 
drug1 : When drug2 120 mg before meals was administered in combination with a single 1-mg dose of drug3 to healthy volunteers , there were no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either agent . 
drug1 : When healthy subjects were administered drug2 120 mg three times daily before meals for four days in combination with a single dose of drug3 30 mg on day 2 , there were no alterations in the pharmacokinetics of either agent . 
Prothrombin time was not affected . 
drug1 : Administration of morning and lunch doses of drug2 120 mg in combination with a single 75-mg dose of drug3 in healthy volunteers resulted in no significant changes to the pharmacokinetics of either agent . 
drug1 is highly bound to plasma proteins ( 98 % ) , mainly albumin . 
In vitro displacement studies with highly protein-bound drugs such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 showed no influence on the extent of drug12 protein binding . 
Similarly , drug1 had no influence on the serum protein binding of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 in vitro . 
However , prudent evaluation of individual cases is warranted in the clinical setting . 
Certain drugs , including drug1 ( drug2 ) , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of drug6 and other oral drug7 . 
Certain drugs including drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 may reduce the hypoglycemic action of drug5 and other oral drug6 . 
When these drugs are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving drug1 , the patient should be observed closely for changes in glycemic control . 
Additive depressant effect when used with general drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and other drug6 . 
drug1 : The mixing of drug2 with an drug3 in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the drug4 . 
drug1 : When used in the perioperative period , drug2 has been implicated in the prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade of drug3 . 
Caution is indicated when drug1 is used perioperatively . 
In one controlled clinical study , the ureidopenicillins , including drug1 , were reported to prolong the action of drug2 . 
Due to their similar mechanism of action , it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade produced by any of the drug1 could be prolonged in the presence of drug2 . 
drug1 : The oral combination of drug2 before intramuscular injection of drug3 produces an increase in drug4 peak serum level of about 30 % . 
drug1 : Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly during simultaneous administration of high doses of drug2 , oral drug3 , or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation system or the thrombocyte function . 
drug1 : drug2 may reduce the excretion of drug3 . 
Therefore , serum levels of drug1 should be monitored in patients to avoid drug toxicity . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions As with other drug1 , the administration of drug2 may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine using a copper-reduction method . 
It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used . 
There have been reports of positive test results using the Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test in patients receiving drug1 / drug2 injection who were subsequently found to be free of Aspergillus infection . 
Cross-reactions with non-Aspergillus polysaccharides and polyfuranoses with the Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test have been reported . 
Therefore , positive test results in patients receiving drug1 should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by other diagnostic methods . 
It is recommended that drug1 not be used concomitantly with drug2 Because the effects of concomitant administration of drug3 with most other drug4 have not been studied , the concomitant use of drug5 with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution . 
There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT ( ALT ) in a few patients . 
In a similar study , attempting to replicate this finding , no interactive effect on hepatic transaminases was identified . 
In a study in normal volunteers , concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 resulted in increased serum drug3 concentrations . 
The clinical significance of this finding is not clear . 
In vitro , drug1 does not displace tightly bound drugs like drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 from serum proteins . 
However , there has been one report of prolonged prothrombin time when drug1 was added to the regimen of a patient treated with drug2 . 
The patient was also chronically receiving drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
In vitro , drug1 may displace less firmly bound drugs like drug2 . 
The clinical significance of this property is unknown . 
drug1 in combination with other drug2 , general drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or other drug7 ( including drug8 ) has additive depressant effects . 
When s.c. 
combination therapy is contemplated , the dosage of one or both agents should be reduced . 
The vasodilating effects of drug1 may be additive with those of other drug2 . 
drug1 , in particular , has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety . 
Drug Interaction with drug1 and drug2 drug3 has been shown to exhibit minimal ( ca. 5 % ) metabolism . 
However , co administration of drug1 with either drug2 or drug3 led to increased plasma concentrations of drug4 . 
drug1 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug2 or drug3 . 
In 2 separate studies , drug1 120 mg twice daily ( 240 mg total daily dose ) was co-administered with either drug2 500 mg every 8 hours or drug3 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy volunteers ( n=24 , each study ) . 
No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered drug1 alone or in combination with either drug2 or drug3 . 
The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table : Effects on steady-state drug1 pharmacokinetics after 7 days of co-administration with drug2 120 mg every 12 hours ( two times the recommended twice daily dose ) in healthy volunteers ( n=24 ) 
Concomitant Drug

+135 % 
+164 % 
The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials . 
The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro , in situ , and in vivo animal models . 
These studies indicate that drug1 or drug2 co-administration enhances drug3 gastrointestinal absorption . 
This observed increase in the bioavailability of drug1 may be due to transport-related effects , such as p-glycoprotein. in vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption , drug2 decreases drug3 gastrointestinal secretion , while drug4 may also decrease biliary excretion . 
Drug Interactions with drug1 Administration of 120 mg of drug2 ( 2 x 60 mg capsule ) within 15 minutes of an drug3 and drug4 containing drug5 ( drug6 ) decreased drug7 AUC by 41 % and cmax by 43 % . 
drug1 should not be taken closely in time with drug2 and drug3 containing drug4 . 
Interactions with Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit , orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of drug1 . 
This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using drug1 induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis . 
The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when drug1 was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water . 
Based on the literature reports , the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice . 
The clinical significance of these observations is unknown . 
In addition , based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study , the bioavailability of drug1 was reduced by 36 % . 
Therefore , to maximize the effects of drug1 , it is recommended that drug2 should be taken with water 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
No formal studies to evaluate drug interactions with drug1 have been conducted . 
drug1 oxidative metabolites appear to be formed by cytochrome P450 3A4 . 
On the basis of the metabolism of drug1 by cytochrome P450 3A4 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , grapefruit juice , and other inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 would be expected to lead to an increase in plasma drug6 concentrations . 
Furthermore , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and other inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma drug4 concentrations . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 capsules and drug2 resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of drug3 , probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by drug4 . 
Under similar conditions , drug1 concentrations were not affected by concomitant drug2 administration . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 capsules is not recommended . 
drug1 : In controlled clinical studies , drug2 have been frequently administered concomitantly with drug3 . 
The combination is well tolerated . 
drug1 : drug2 increases drug3 plasma levels . 
Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored . 
drug1 : Some drug2 may increase the concentration of drug3 in the blood . 
drug1 usually does not alter the plasma levels of drug2 , however , serum drug3 levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with drug4 is initiated . 
drug1 * Coadministration of drug2 had no effect on drug3 absorption . 
Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with drug1 , an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 levels . 
Plasma concentrations of drug1 should therefore be closely monitored , and its dosage reduced accordingly , in patients treated with drug2 . 
When therapeutic concentrations of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 were added to human plasma ( in vitro ) , the plasma protein binding of drug7 was not altered . 
Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of drug1 include : drug2 ; 
drug1 ; 
drug1 ; 
certain drug1 , especially the drug2 and drug3 ; 
drug1 ; 
drug1 salts ; 
drug1 ; 
Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of drug1 include : drug2 ; drug3 ; drug4 ; certain drug5 , especially the drug6 and drug7 ; drug8 ; drug9 salts ; drug10 ; and drug11 . 
If other drug1 are used during the same procedure , the possibility of a synergistic or antagonist effect should be considered . 
The prior administration of drug1 does not enhance the duration , but quickens the onset and may increase the depth , of neuromuscular block induced by drug2 . 
drug1 should not be administered until a patient has recovered from drug2 -induced neuromuscular block . 
No formal assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between drug1 and other agents have been conducted . 
Caution is advised when drug1 is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval ( e.g. certain drug2 or drug3 ) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities ( such as drug4 or drug5 ) . 
drug1 interferes with the absorption of drug2 , including drug3 . 
Administration of drug1 to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with drug2 may cause hypercalcemia . 
drug1 ( CNS ) drugs including drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , blood pressure medications ( drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) , motion sickness medications , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , sleeping pills and drug12 
Although no clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted to date , on the basis of the in vitro studies , cytochrome p450 inhibitors and inducers are unlikely to affect the metabolism of drug1 . 
The effect of drug1 on the metabolism of cytochrome p450 substrates has not been studied . 
Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions There are no known clinically significant interactions of drug1 with other medications or laboratory tests . 
No formal drug/laboratory test interaction studies have been conducted with drug1 . 
Unless really needed , agents which may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of drug1 Injection therapy . 
These agents include medications such as : drug1 , drug2 including drug3 , sali-cylates , drug4 ( including drug5 ) , drug6 , or drug7 . 
If co-administration is essential , conduct close clinical and laboratory monitoring 
.

No interactions have been observed between drug1 and drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 
drug1 does not inhibit the cytochrome P-450-linked drug-metabolizing enzyme system ; 
therefore , drug interactions mediated by inhibition of hepatic metabolism are not expected to occur . 
In patients given very high doses ( 3900 mg ) of drug1 daily , increases in serum drug2 levels were seen when drug3 , 150 mg b.i.d. , was administered concurrently . 
drug1 should not be combined with other drug2 . 
Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs , such as drug1 or drug2 , should be closely monitored , because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of drug3 may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity . 
In patients receiving concurrent therapy with drug1 , if therapy is to be discontinued , it is suggested that drug2 be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of drug3 . 
drug1 should be used with care when drug2 or inhibitors of AV conduction , such as certain drug3 ( particularly of the drug4 [ drug5 ] and drug6 [ drug7 ] classes ) , or drug8 , such as drug9 , are used concurrently . 
Concurrent use of drug1 increases the metabolic clearance of drug2 , resulting in a shortened elimination half-life of drug3 . 
However , initial dose modification is generally not necessary . 
Pharmacokinetic studies document no clinically relevant interactions with other agents given concomitantly , including drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 . 
There was no effect of drug1 on prothrombin time in patients on stable doses of drug2 . 
Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction : While taking drug1 , patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of drug1 used to treat allergic reactions . 
Hypertensive crises have resulted when drug1 have been used concomitantly within14 days following use of drug2 . 
drug1 should not be used concomitantly with other drug2 . 
drug1 may decrease the hypotensive effect of drug2 . 
drug1 may enhance the effects of drug2 . 
Urinary alkalinizing agents increase blood levels and decrease excretion of drug1 . 
drug1 agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of drug2 . 
drug1 -containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions . 
Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive , use of drug1 -containing or drug2 ( like drug3 or drug4 ) and drug5 within 24 hours is contraindicated . 
The administration of drug1 with other drug2 has not been evaluated in migraine patients . 
Because their vasospastic effects may be additive , coadministration of drug1 and other drug2 within 24 hours of each other is not recommended . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) have been reported , rarely , to cause weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination when coadministered with 5-HTv agonists . 
If concomitant treatment with drug1 and an drug2 is clinically warranted , appropriate observation of the patient is advised . 
Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 Tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests . 
The vasodilating effects of drug1 may be additive with those of other drug2 . 
drug1 , in particular , has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety . 
Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when drug1 and drug2 were used in combination . 
Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary . 
The risks of using drug1 in combination with other drugs have not been systematically evaluated . 
Pharmacodynamic-related Interactions : The mechanism of drug1 induced agranulocytosis is unknown ; 
nonetheless , the possibility that causative factors may interact synergistically to increase the risk and/or severity of bone marrow suppression warrants consideration . 
Therefore , drug1 should not be used with other agents having a well-known potential to suppress bone marrow function . 
Given the primary CNS effects of drug1 , caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs or drug2 . 
Orthostatic hypotension in patients taking drug1 can , in rare cases ( approximately 1 case per 3,000 patients ) , be accompanied by profound collapse and respiratory and/or cardiac arrest . 
Some of the cases of collapse/respiratory arrest/cardiac arrest during initial treatment occurred in patients who were being administered drug1 ; 
similar events have been reported in patients taking other drug1 or even drug2 by itself . 
Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between drug1 and drug2 or other drug3 , caution is advised when drug4 is initiated in patients taking a drug5 or any other drug6 . 
drug1 may potentiate the hypotensive effects of drug2 and the anticholinergic effects of drug3 -type drugs . 
The administration of drug1 should be avoided in the treatment of drug induced hypotension because of a possible reverse drug2 effect . 
Pharmacokinetic-related Interactions : drug1 is a substrate for many CYP 450 isozymes , in particular 1A2 , 2D6 , and 3A4 . 
The risk of metabolic interactions caused by an effect on an individual isoform is therefore minimized . 
Nevertheless , caution should be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with other drugs that are either inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes . 
Concomitant administration of drugs known to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes may decrease the plasma levels of drug1 . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may decrease drug4 plasma levels , resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective drug5 dose . 
Concomitant administration of drugs known to inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes may increase the plasma levels of drug1 . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may increase plasma levels of drug4 , potentially resulting in adverse effects . 
Although concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 is not recommended , it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant drug3 administration may result in an increase in drug4 plasma levels . 
In a study of schizophrenic patients who received drug1 under steady state conditions , drug2 or drug3 was added in 16 and 14 patients , respectively . 
After 14 days of co-administration , mean trough concentrations of drug1 and its metabolites , drug2 and drug3 , were elevated with drug4 by about three-fold compared to baseline concentrations . 
drug1 produced only minor changes in the levels of drug2 and its metabolites . 
However , other published reports describe modest elevations ( less than two-fold ) of drug1 and metabolite concentrations when drug2 was taken with drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Therefore , such combined treatment should be approached with caution and patients should be monitored closely when drug1 is combined with these drugs , particularly with drug2 . 
A reduced drug1 dose should be considered . 
A subset ( 3 % -10 % ) of the population has reduced activity of certain drug metabolizing enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 isozyme P450 2D6 . 
Such individuals are referred to as poor metabolizers of drugs such as drug1 , drug2 , the drug3 , and drug4 . 
These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of drug1 when given usual doses . 
In addition , certain drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme , including many drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , and others ) , may inhibit the activity of this isozyme , and thus may make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system , leading to drug interaction . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either drug2 or the other drug . 
Therefore , co-administration of drug1 with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme , including drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ( e.g. , drug6 , drug7 and drug8 ) , or that inhibit this enzyme ( e.g. , drug9 ) , should be approached with caution . 
Milk , milk products , and drug1 -rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of drug2 .

Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following drugs : drug1 s ( drug2 ) other drug3 drug4 drug5 drug6 ( drug7 ) drug8 ( drug9 ) drug10 drug11 ( drug12 ) intraconazole ( drug13 ) drug14 ( drug15 ) drug16 drug17 drug18 birth control pills sleeping pills thyroid medications 
Increases in serum creatinine have occurred when drug1 was given alone . 
If drug1 and an drug2 are used concomitantly , renal function should be carefully monitored , because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : The administration of drug1 may result in a false positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest , Benedicts solution , or Fehlings solution . 
It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase be used . 
As with other drug1 , high concentrations of drug2 may interfere with measurement of serum and urine creatinine levels by Jaffe reaction and produce false increases in the levels of creatinine reported . 
drug1 may interact with the following medications : drug2 ( drug3 ) , drug4 such as drug5 and drug6 , drug7 ( drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 ) , drug14 ( drug15 , drug16 , drug17 ) , drug18 ( drug19 ) , drug20 ( drug21 ) , drug22 ( drug23 , drug24 ) , HIV drugs classified as drug25 ( drug26 , drug27 , drug28 , drug29 , drug30 , drug31 , drug32 ) , drug33 ( drug34 , drug35 , drug36 ) , drug37 , drug38 ( drug39 ) , drug40 ( drug41 ) , St. Johns wort , drug42 , drug43 ( drug44 ) , and drug45 . 
drug1 : Substrate of CYP3A4 ( major ) , 3A5-7 ( minor ) ; 
Inhibits CYP1A2 ( weak ) , 2B6 ( weak ) , 2C19 ( weak ) , 3A4 ( weak ) . 
drug1 : May increase plasma concentration of drug2 , possibly by inhibiting conjugation . 
Combination drug1 may also decrease the plasma concentration of drug2 . 
drug1 : Interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed drug2 -containing minipill preparations . 
The effect on other drug1 ( eg , implants , injectables ) is unknown . 
drug1 : May increase CYP metabolism of drug2 leading to possible decrease in contraceptive effectiveness . 
Use of a drug1 is recommended . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 ) : Pregnancy has been reported following concomitant use , however , pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects with these drug4 on plasma concentrations of drug5 . 
Use of a drug1 is recommended . 
drug1 : Combination drug2 may increase or decrease the effects of drug3 . 
Combination drug1 may also increase risk of thromboembolic disorders . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) : Increase the metabolism of drug7 and/or some drug8 , leading to possible decrease in contraceptive effectiveness . 
Use of a drug1 is recommended . 
drug1 : Doses of drug2 ( drug3 ) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of drug4 by ~47 % , possibly by inhibiting conjugation ; 
clinical implications are unclear . 
drug1 : drug2 increases the AUC for drug3 and drug4 . 
drug1 : Combination drug2 may decrease the clearance of some drug3 ( drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) and increase the clearance of others ( drug7 , drug8 , drug9 ) . 
drug1 : Combination drug2 may increase the clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 : Combination drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , leading to increased plasma concentrations ; 
monitor drug1 levels . 
CYP3A4 inducers : CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of drug1 . 
Example inducers include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 
drug1 : drug2 may induce the metabolism of drug3 causing menstrual changes ; 
pregnancies have been reported . 
Use of barrier form of contraception is suggested while on drug1 therapy . 
drug1 : Combination drug2 may increase the clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) : drug3 may decrease plasma levels of drug4 ; 
use of a drug1 is recommended . 
No data for drug1 ; 
incomplete data for drug1 . 
drug1 : drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , leading to increased plasma concentrations . 
drug1 : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 have been shown to decrease plasma levels of drug6 ; 
use of a drug1 is recommended . 
drug1 has been shown to increase plasma levels of drug2 . 
No data for drug1 . 
drug1 : drug2 increases the metabolism of drug3 and some drug4 ( drug5 ) resulting in decreased contraceptive effectiveness and increased menstrual irregularities . 
Use of a drug1 is recommended . 
drug1 : Combination drug2 may increase the clearance of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 may increase the serum concentration of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 , leading to increased plasma concentrations . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) : Metabolism may be inhibited by drug5 , increasing plasma levels of drug6 ; 
use caution . 
drug1 / NUTRITION / HERB INTERACTIONS : Food : CNS effects of drug2 may be enhanced if drug3 are used concurrently with drug4 . 
Grapefruit juice increases drug1 concentrations and would be expected to increase drug2 serum levels as well ; 
clinical implications are unclear . 
Herb/Nutraceutical : St Johns wort may decrease the effectiveness of drug1 by inducing hepatic enzymes . 
Avoid dong quai and black cohosh ( have estrogen activity ) . 
Avoid saw palmetto , red clover , ginseng . 
No drug interaction studies have been conducted for drug1 , however the use of orally administered drug2 could , theoretically , interfere with the release of drug3 in the colon . 
The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important . 
Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as drug1 , drug2 and drug3 may increase the clearance of drug4 and may require increases in drug5 dose to achieve the desired response . 
Drugs such as drug1 and drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 and thus decrease their clearance . 
Therefore , the dose of drug1 should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity . 
drug1 may increase the clearance of chronic high dose drug2 . 
This could lead to decreased drug1 serum levels or increase the risk of drug2 toxicity when drug3 is withdrawn . 
drug1 should be used cautiously in conjunction with drug2 in patients suffering from hypopro-thrombinemia . 
The effect of drug1 on oral drug2 is variable . 
There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of drug1 when given concurrently with drug2 . 
Therefore , coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect . 
Drug Interactions : a. Drugs Enhancing drug1 Effect : Oral drug2 : drug3 may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time . 
Therefore , when drug1 is given with drug2 or drug3 , a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained . 
drug1 : Drugs such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions ( the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients ) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving drug9 . 
The anticoagulant effect of drug1 is enhanced by concurrent treatment with drug2 ( human ) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency . 
Thus in order to avoid bleeding , reduced dosage of drug1 is recommended during treatment with drug2 ( human ) . 
b . 
Drugs Decreasing drug1 Effect : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of drug6 . 
drug1 Injection should not be mixed with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 , since it has been reported that these drugs are incompatible with drug6 and a precipitate may form . 
Drug/ Laboratory Tests Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia : Significant elevations of aminotransferase ( SGOT [S-AST ] and SGPT [S-ALT ] ) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients ( and healthy subjects ) who have received drug1 . 
Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction , liver disease and pulmonary emboli , rises that might be caused by drugs ( drug1 ) should be interpreted with caution . 
The following drugs have been coadministered with drug1 and have not altered its pharmacokinetics : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 with the oral drug2 drug3 has been shown not to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of drug4 . 
Catecholamine-depleting drugs ( e.g. , drug1 ) may have an additive effect when given with drug2 agents . 
Patients treated with a drug1 plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
Should it be decided to discontinue therapy in patients receiving drug1 and drug2 concurrently , the drug3 should be discontinued slowly over several days before the gradual withdrawal of drug4 . 
Literature reports suggest that oral drug1 may be used in combination with drug2 when heart function is normal , but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function . 
Hypotension , AV conduction disturbances , and left ventricular failure have been reported in some patients receiving drug1 when an oral drug2 was added to the treatment regimen . 
Hypotension was more likely to occur if the drug1 were a drug2 , e.g. , drug3 , while left ventricular failure and AV conduction disturbances , including complete heart block , were more likely to occur with either drug4 or drug5 . 
Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction : Although it is known that patients on drug1 may be refractory to drug2 in the treatment of anaphylactic shock , drug3 can , in addition , interfere with the modulation of allergic reaction and lead to an increased severity and/or frequency of attacks . 
Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported in patients exposed to a variety of allergens either by repeated challenge , or accidental contact , and with diagnostic or therapeutic agents while receiving drug1 . 
Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of drug1 used to treat allergic reaction .

No formal interaction studies have been performed . 
The duration of the period following treatment with drug1 before one should consider starting other drug2 therapy has not been evaluated . 
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Fertility 
In a chronic toxicity study , cynomolgus monkeys were dosed weekly for 52 weeks with intravenous drug1 at 1 mg/kg/dose or 20 mg/kg/dose . 
One animal in the high dose group developed a B-cell lymphoma that was detected after 28 weeks of dosing . 
Additional animals in both dose groups developed B-cell hyperplasia of the spleen and lymph nodes . 
All animals in the study were positive for an endemic primate gammaherpes virus also known as lymphocryptovirus ( LCV ) . 
Latent LCV infection is generally asymptomatic , but can lead to B-cell lymphomas when animals are immune suppressed . 
In a separate study , baboons given 3 doses of drug1 at 1 mg/kg every 8 weeks were found to have centroblast proliferation in B-cell dependent areas in the germinal centers of the spleen following a 116-day washout period . 
The role of drug1 in the development of the lymphoid malignancy and the hyperplasia observed in non-human primates and the relevance to humans is unknown . 
Immunodeficiency-associated lymphocyte disorders ( plasmacytic hyperplasia , polymorphic proliferation , and B-cell lymphomas ) occur in patients who have congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies including those resulting from drug1 therapy . 
No carcinogenicity or fertility studies were conducted . 
Mutagenicity studies were conducted in vitro and in vivo ; 
no evidence of mutagenicity was observed . 
Pregnancy ( Category B ) 
Women of childbearing potential make up a considerable segment of the patient population affected by psoriasis . 
Since the effect of drug1 on pregnancy and fetal development , including immune system development , is not known , health care providers are encouraged to enroll patients currently taking drug2 who become pregnant into the Biogen Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-866- drug3 ( 1-866-263-8483 ) . 
Reproductive toxicology studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 5 mg/kg/week ( about 62 times the human dose based on body weight ) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to drug1 . 
No abortifacient or teratogenic effects were observed in cynomolgus monkeys following intravenous bolus injections of drug1 administered weekly during the period of organogenesis to gestation . 
drug1 underwent trans-placental passage and produced in utero exposure in the developing monkeys . 
In utero , serum levels of exposure in these monkeys were 23 % of maternal serum levels . 
No evidence of fetal toxicity including adverse effects on immune system development was observed in any of these animals . 
Animal reproduction studies , however , are not always predictive of human response and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women . 
Because the risk to the development of the fetal immune system and postnatal immune function in humans is unknown , drug1 should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed . 
If pregnancy occurs while taking drug1 , continued use of the drug should be assessed . 
Nursing Mothers 
It is not known whether drug1 is excreted in human milk . 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , and because there exists the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from drug1 , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing while taking the drug or to discontinue the use of the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother . 
Geriatric Use 
Of the 1357 patients who received drug1 in clinical trials , a total of 100 patients were 
65 years of age and 13 patients were 
75 years of age . 
No differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients , but there were not sufficient data to exclude important differences . 
Because the incidence of infections and certain malignancies is higher in the elderly population , in general , caution should be used in treating the elderly . 
Pediatric Use 
The safety and efficacy of drug1 in pediatric patients have not been studied . 
drug1 is not indicated for pediatric patients . 
drug1 prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of drug2 . 
drug1 may have additive effects with drug2 and other drug3 , e.g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 . 
drug1 : drug2 has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking concomitant drug3 . 
The data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either drug1 or drug2 . 
drug1 : Concurrent administration of drug2 ( an drug3 ) and another drug4 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections , an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone . 
The safety and efficacy of drug1 used in combination with drug2 has not been studied . 
Therefore the , combination of drug1 with other drug2 , including drug3 , may also result i n similar toxicities . 
Concomitant use with other drug1 -containing medicines ( including drug2 ) may cause too much drug3 in the blood or urine , which may increase the chance of side effects . 
Using drug1 with drug2 ( heart medicine ) may cause hypercalcemia ( too much drug3 in the blood ) , which could increase the chance of developing an irregular heartbeat . 
Tablet If a patient receiving drug1 is also taking drug2 , the effect of drug3 may be reduced , thus necessitating an increase in dosage . 
drug1 may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of drug2 , drug3 or other drug4 . 
drug1 in combination with drug2 enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection drug3 may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of drug4 , drug5 or other drug6 . 
drug1 may potentiate the hypotensive effects of drug2 . 
drug1 may antagonize the hypotensive effects of drug2 . 
The effects of drug1 on drug2 s analgesic actions are not known . 
drug1 may exacerbate the hypertensive response seen with drug2 withdrawl . 
Also , due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block , caution is warranted in patients receiving drug1 with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . ) 
There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of drug1 and oral drug2 . 
Symptoms resolved when drug1 was withdrawn and recurred when the patient was rechallenged with drug2 . 
Epidural drug1 may prolong the duration of pharmacologic effects of epidural local drug2 , including both sensory and motor blockade . 
No evidence of interaction of drug1 with other drugs was observed in the course of clinical trials . 
drug1 ( drug2 ophthalmic suspension ) 1 % contains a drug3 . 
Acid-base and electrolyte alterations were not reported in the clinical trials with drug1 . 
However , in patients treated with oral drug1 , rare instances of drug interactions have occurred with high-dose drug2 therapy . 
Therefore , the potential for such drug interaction should be considered in patients receiving drug1 ( drug2 ophthalmic suspension ) 1 % . 
Certain drug1 , especially drug2 , drug3 and drug4 , have a mild but definite nondepolarizing blocking action which may accentuate neuromuscular block . 
These drug1 should be used in the myasthenic patient only where definitely indicated , and then careful adjustment should be made of adjunctive drug2 dosage . 
Local and some general drug1 , drug2 and other drugs that interfere with neuromuscular transmission should be used cautiously , if at all , in patients with myasthenia gravis ; 
the dose of drug1 may have to be increased accordingly . 
The following drug interactions were studied with drug1 doses of 200 mg/day . 
The possibility of increased interaction should be kept in mind when drug1 doses greater than 50 mg as a single dose or 200 mg of drug2 per day are used concomitantly with highly bound drugs . 
1 . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 does not interfere with the rate or extent of the absorption of drug4 administered as drug5 . 
2 . 
drug1 : drug2 does not alter drug3 absorption ; 
however , in a study of 12 normal subjects , concurrent administration of drug1 decreased drug2 protein binding and increased drug3 plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without drug4 to 0.11 L/kg/h with drug5 . 
The clinical significance of these changes has not been adequately studied . 
Therefore , concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 is not recommended . 
3 . 
drug1 : drug2 , given concomitantly with drug3 , produces a reduction in urinary potassium and chloride excretion compared to drug4 alone . 
Patients taking drug1 are at a greater risk of developing renal failure secondary to a decrease in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin inhibition . 
4 . 
drug1 : In a study in 12 patients with congestive heart failure where drug2 and drug3 were concomitantly administered , drug4 did not alter the serum levels of drug5 . 
5 . 
drug1 : In a short-term controlled study in 14 normal volunteers , drug2 did not significantly interfere with the effect of drug3 on prothrombin time . 
Bleeding from a number of sites may be a complication of drug1 treatment and GI bleeding a complication of drug2 treatment . 
Because prostaglandina play an important role in hemostasis and drug1 has an effect on platelet function as well , concurent therapy with drug2 and drug3 requires close monitoring of patients on both drugs . 
6 . 
drug1 : drug2 increases both free and bound drug3 by reducing the plasma clearance of drug4 to about one-third , as well as decreasing its protein binding . 
Therefore , the combination of drug1 and drug2 is not recommended . 
7 . 
drug1 : drug2 , like other drug3 , may cause changes in the elimination of drug4 leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity . 
8 . 
drug1 : drug2 have been reported to increase steadystate plasma drug3 levels . 
It is recommended that plasma drug1 levels be monitored when drug2 is coadministered with drug3 . 
DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS : EFFECT ON BLOOD COAGULATION drug1 decreases platelet adhesion and aggregation . 
Therefore , it can prolong bleeding time by approximately 3 to 4 minutes from baseline values . 
There is no significant change in platelet count , prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , or thrombin time . 
Because drug1 have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on drug2 therapy may require downward adjustment of their drug3 dosage . 
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of drug1 , it is advisable to avoid giving drug2 in conjunction with drug3 . 
Absorption of drug1 is impaired by drug2 containing drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 , and drug6 -containing preparations . 
Absorption of drug1 is impaired by drug2 . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 decrease the half-life of drug4 . 
The concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity . 
Concurrent use of drug1 may render oral drug2 less effective . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test . 
General No clinical drug interaction studies were performed . 
No evaluation of drug1 s effects on the cytochrome P450 system was conducted . 
As with other drug1 , blood concentrations of dialyzable drugs may be reduced by dialysis . 
Dosage adjustment of concomitant medications may be necessary . 
In patients using drug1 ( drug2 and others ) , plasma levels of calcium , potassium and magnesium must be carefully monitored . 
drug1 : A clinical study in 6 insulin-dependent diabetic patients demonstrated no effect of drug2 on drug3 absorption from the peritoneal cavity or on drug4 s ability to control blood glucose when drug5 was administered intraperitoneally with drug6 . 
However , appropriate monitoring of blood glucose should be performed when initiating drug1 in diabetic patients and drug2 dosage should be adjusted if needed . 
drug1 : No human drug interaction studies with drug2 were conducted . 
In vitro studies demonstrated no evidence of incompatibility of drug1 with drug2 . 
drug1 : No human drug interaction studies with drug2 were conducted . 
In vitro studies evaluating the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 /flucoxacillin , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 demonstrated no evidence of incompatibility of these drug8 with drug9 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Blood Glucose Blood glucose measurement must be done with a glucose-specific method to prevent maltose interference with test results . 
Since falsely elevated glucose levels have been observed with blood glucose monitoring devices and test strips that use glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone ( GDH PQQ ) -based methods , GDH PQQ-based methods should not be used to measure glucose levels in patients administered drug1 . . 
Serum Amylase An apparent decrease in serum amylase activity has been observed in patients administered drug1 . 
Preliminary investigations indicate that drug1 and its metabolites interfere with enzymatic-based amylase assays , resulting in inaccurately low values . 
This should be taken into account when evaluating serum amylase levels for diagnosis or monitoring of pancreatitis in patients using drug1 . 
drug1 should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a drug2 orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade . 
Close observation of the patient is recommended when a drug1 is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as drug2 , because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
drug1 may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given drug2 . 
In order to avoid drug1 intoxication , drug2 plasma levels should be monitored closely . 
If drug1 is given concomitantly with drug2 , the drug3 dose should be reduced ( by approx. 50 % ) , because drug4 amplifies the therapeutic actions and side-effects of drug5 massively . 
Avoid the concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) . 
Massive seizures may be encountered with this combination . 
Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge , if drug1 is given with drug2 or drug3 . 
Choose particular low doses of these drugs . 
Exert particular caution in combining drug1 with other drug2 ( drug3 and drug4 ) : Particularly the elderly may develop delirium , high fever , severe obstipation , even ileus and glaucoma . 
There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression , stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 . 
The risk of using drug1 in combination with CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated . 
Therefore , caution is advised if the concomitant administration of drug1 and CNS-active drugs is required . 
No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with drug1 ( drug2 USP ) Tablets . 
The following information was obtained from the literature . 
drug1 : drug2 has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of drug3 . 
Adjustment of drug1 dosage may be necessary . 
drug1 : drug2 may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of drug3 , thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis . 
If drug1 or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with drug2 or drug3 , lower plasma levels of drug4 may occur . 
Monitoring of drug1 plasma levels is recommended in such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy . 
Other drug1 ( eg , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ) have occasionally been used concurrently with drug6 . 
Excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval may occur in these situations . 
In healthy subjects , no significant drug-drug interaction was observed when drug1 was coadministered with either drug2 or drug3 . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 resulted in slight increases in plasma drug3 levels and slight decreases in plasma drug4 levels . 
drug1 does not increase serum drug2 levels . 
Patients taking drug1 and drug2 concomitantly may develop increased serum concentrations of drug3 resulting in excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval . 
Patients taking drug1 and hepatic enzyme inhibitors concomitantly should be closely monitored . 
Until data on possible interactions between drug1 and drug2 are obtained , drug3 should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after drug4 administration . 
The potential for increased sedation when drug1 is given with other drug2 should be appreciated . 
The administration of drug1 concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer ( drug2 or drug3 ) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration . 
In such cases , therefore , more frequent dosing may be required to achieve or maintain the desired hypotensive response . 
Further , if drug1 is to be discontinued in such patients , careful tapering of the dosage may be necessary in order to avoid rebound phenomena . 
drug1 decrease the hypotensive effect of drug2 . 
drug1 ( drug2 , porpranolol , drug3 ) may exacerbate rebound hypertension when drug4 is withdrawn . 
The drug1 should be withdrawn first . 
The gradual withdrawal of drug1 or a drug2 could be substituted . 
drug1 : Ten patients who were stabilized on oral drug2 were given drug3 , 1-2 mg/day , for 4 weeks . 
No changes were observed in the degree of anticoagulation . 
In several well-controlled studies , drug1 was administered together with drug2 with no drug interactions reported . 
In the long-term safety studies , drug1 was given concomitantly with many drugs without evidence of any interactions . 
The principal drugs given ( number of patients in parentheses ) were : drug1 ( 115 ) , drug2 and drug3 ( 103 ) , drug4 ( 52 ) , oral drug5 ( 45 ) , cough and cold preparations ( 45 ) , drug6 ( 38 ) , drug7 ( 29 ) , drug8 ( 24 ) , oral drug9 ( 18 ) , drug10 ( 13 ) , drug11 ( 10 ) , and drug12 ( 10 ) . 
Laboratory Test In clinical trials , no clinically relevant laboratory test abnormalities were identified as causally related to drug during short-term treatment with drug1 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions No laboratory test abnormalities related to the use of drug1 have been identified . 
The interaction of drug1 with other cardioactive or cerebroactive drugs has not been studied . 
In addition to bleeding associated with drug1 and drug2 , drugs that alter platelet function ( such as drug3 , drug4 and drug5 ) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to , during , or after drug6 therapy . 
Use of drug1 drug2 and drug3 have been administered concomitantly with and following infusions of drug4 in the management of acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism . 
Because drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 may cause bleeding complications , careful monitoring for bleeding is advised , especially at arterial puncture sites . 
The concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 during the first 24 hours following symptom onset were prohibited in The NINDS t-PA Stroke Trial . 
The safety of such concomitant use with drug1 for the management of acute ischemic stroke is unknown . 
Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of drug1 , caution should be used when drug2 is taken in combination with other drug3 and drug4 . 
Due to its 
1- adrenergic receptor antagonism , drug1 has the potential to enhance the effect of certain drug2 . 
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect drug1 drug2 is not a substrate of CYP1A1 , CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2E1 enzymes . 
drug1 also does not undergo direct glucuronidation . 
This suggests that an interaction of drug1 with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes , or other factors , like smoking , is unlikely . 
Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for drug1 metabolism . 
Agents that induce CYP3A4 ( eg , drug1 ) could cause an increase in drug2 clearance and lower blood levels . 
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( eg , drug1 ) or CYP2D6 ( eg , drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 ) can inhibit drug5 elimination and cause increased blood levels . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 ( 200 mg/day for 14 days ) with a 15-mg single dose of drug3 increased the AUC of drug4 and its active metabolite by 63 % and 77 % , respectively . 
The effect of a higher drug1 dose ( 400 mg/day ) has not been studied . 
When concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 occurs , drug3 dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose . 
Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( drug1 ) would be expected to have similar effects and need similar dose reductions ; 
weaker inhibitors ( drug1 , grapefruit juice ) have not been studied . 
When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , drug1 dose should then be increased . 
drug1 : Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of drug2 with drug3 ( 166 mg/day for 13 days ) , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 , increased the AUC of drug4 by 112 % but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite , drug5 , by 35 % . 
drug1 dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 occurs . 
Other significant inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as drug1 or drug2 , would be expected to have similar effects and , therefore , should be accompanied by similar dose reductions . 
When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , drug1 dose should then be increased . 
drug1 : Coadministration of drug2 ( 200 mg BID ) , a potent CYP3A4 inducer , with drug3 ( 30 mg QD ) resulted in an approximate 70 % decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both drug4 and its active metabolite , drug5 . 
When drug1 is added to drug2 therapy , drug3 dose should be doubled . 
Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation . 
When drug1 is withdrawn from the combination therapy , drug2 dose should then be reduced . 
No clinically significant effect of drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 was seen on the pharmacokinetics of drug4 ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug- Drug Interactions ) . 
Potential for drug1 to Affect Other Drugs drug2 is unlikely to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes . 
In in vivo studies , 10- to 30-mg/day doses of drug1 had no significant effect on metabolism by CYP2D6 ( drug2 ) , CYP2C9 ( drug3 ) , CYP2C19 ( drug4 , drug5 ) , and CYP3A4 ( drug6 ) substrates . 
Additionally , drug1 and drug2 did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro . 
drug1 : There was no significant difference between drug2 coadministered with drug3 and placebo coadministered with drug4 on performance of gross motor skills or stimulus response in healthy subjects . 
As with most psychoactive medications , patients should be advised to avoid drug1 while taking drug2

The concurrent use of drug1 Injection with other drug2 or medications with anticholinergic activity , such as drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 , may intensify the antimuscarinic effects and may result in an increase in anticholinergic side effects . 
Concomitant administration of drug1 Injection and drug2 in a wax matrix may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions as a result of a slower gastrointestinal transit time . 
A possible drug interaction of drug1 and intravenous drug2 has been described . 
Concomitant treatment of four patients in the United Kingdom with drug1 and intravenous drug2 may have caused hypocalcemia ; 
one patient died with severe hypocalcemia . 
Toxicity associated with concomitant use of aerosolized drug1 has not been reported . 
Because of drug1 s tendency to cause renal impairment , the use of drug2 should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as drug3 , drug4 and intravenous drug5 unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient . 
Since drug1 decreases serum concentrations of ionized calcium , concurrent treatment with other drugs known to influence serum calcium concentrations should be used with particular caution . 
drug1 : The pharmacokinetics of drug2 and drug3 were not altered in 13 patients receiving either concomitant therapy or daily alternating therapy for maintenance of CMV disease . 
and/or Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions . 
Effect of drug1 on other drugs : Drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) : drug2 is a strong in vitro inhibitor of CYP2D6 . 
Therefore , dose adjustments of concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and have a narrow therapeutic index ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and most drug4 ) may be required . 
drug1 : Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg drug2 with 50 mg drug3 increased drug4 exposure and drug5 ( active metabolite ) exposure by approximately 20 % in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers . 
Effect of other drugs on drug1 : drug2 is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes , primarily CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , and CYP1A2 . 
drug1 : drug2 is metabolized in part by CYP3A4 . 
Co-administration of drug1 , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 , increased drug2 exposure following a single 90 mg dose of drug3 by 2.3 fold . 
Dose adjustment of drug1 may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ; 
see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . 
Special care is required if this drug is given to patients receiving drug1 because a critical fall in blood pressure may occur . 
Usually , severe abdominal symptoms appear before there is such a fall in the blood pressure . 
drug1 are strong drug2 , but regular users develop physiological tolerance allowing gradually increased dosages . 
In combination with other drug1 , drug2 may still kill even experienced users , particularly if their tolerance to the drug has reduced or the strength of their usual dose has increased . 
Toxicology studies of drug1 -related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other drug2 , including drug3 , drug4 such as drug5 ( drug6 ) , and , to a rising degree , drug7 . 
Ironically , drug1 are often used in the treatment of drug2 addiction while they cause much more severe withdrawal symptoms . 
drug1 sometimes proves to be fatal when used in combination with drug2 . 
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions , desirable or undesirable , involving drug1 even though drug2 has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs , including other cytotoxic drugs . 
drug1 : In three pharmacokinetic studies including 46 normal , healthy subjects , drug2 clearance and concentration were not significantly altered by the addition of drug3 . 
In clinical studies where patients were on chronic drug1 therapy , drug2 had no measurable effect on the mean distribution of drug3 concentrations or the mean estimates of drug4 clearance . 
Though individual drug1 levels fluctuated , there were no clinically significant symptoms of drug inter-action . 
drug1 and drug2 : drug3 and drug4 containing drug5 or drug6 , as well as formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as drug7 ( drug8 ) , chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution can form chelation complexes with drug9 and interfere with its bioavailability . 
drug1 administered 2 hours before drug2 resulted in a slower absorption ( mean C max decreased by 30 % and mean T max increased by 1 hour ) and a lesser extent of absorption ( mean AUC decreased by approximately 25 % ) . 
drug1 - and drug2 -containing drug3 , administered concomitantly with drug4 , significantly decreased the bioavailability ( 48 % ) of drug5 . 
Separating the doses of drug1 and drug2 minimizes this decrease in bioavailability ; 
therefore , administration of these agents should precede drug1 dosing by 4 hours or follow drug2 dosing by at least 2 hours . 
drug1 : Two hundred mg of drug2 ( equivalent to 1 to 3 cups of American coffee ) was administered to 16 normal , healthy volunteers who had achieved steady-state blood concentrations of drug3 after being dosed at 400 mg qd . 
This did not result in any statistically or clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of either drug1 or its major metabolite , drug2 . 
No data are available on potential interactions in individuals who consume greater than 200 mg of drug1 per day or in those , such as the geriatric population , who are generally believed to be more susceptible to the development of drug-induced CNS-related adverse effects . 
Other drug1 have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of drug2 , resulting in a reduced clearance , a prolongation of plasma half-life , and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of drug3 . 
drug1 : drug2 has been demonstrated to interfere with the elimination of other drug3 . 
This interference has resulted in significant increases in half-life and AUC . 
The interaction between drug1 and drug2 has not been studied . 
drug1 : Elevated serum levels of drug2 have been reported with concomitant use of drug3 with other members of the drug4 . 
Interaction between drug1 and drug2 has not been studied . 
drug1 : No clinically significant changes in drug2 pharmacokinetics ( AUC , C max , or T max ) were observed when a single dose of drug3 400 mg was given after multiple doses of drug4 ( 20 mg qd ) in 13 healthy volunteers . 
Changes in drug1 pharmacokinetics were not studied . 
drug1 : No significant differences were observed in mean drug2 AUC , C max , C min or T max ( although C max increased by 11 % ) when extended drug3 capsules ( 100 mg tid ) were coadministered with drug4 ( 400 mg qd ) for five days in 15 healthy males . 
drug1 is unlikely to have a significant effect on drug2 metabolism . 
drug1 : drug2 slows the renal elimination of lome-floxacin . 
An increase of 63 % in the mean AUC and increases of 50 % and 4 % , respectively , in the mean T max and mean C max were noted in 1 study of 6 individuals . 
drug1 : No clinically significant changes occurred in heart rate or corrected QT intervals , or in drug2 metabolite or drug3 pharmacokinetics , during concurrent administration of drug4 and drug5 at steady-state in 28 healthy males . 
drug1 : drug2 may enhance the effects of the oral drug3 , drug4 , or its derivatives . 
When these products are administered concomitantly , prothrombin or other suitable coagulation tests should be monitored closely . 
However , no clinically or statistically significant differences in prothrombin time ratio or drug1 enantiomer pharmacokinetics were observed in a small study of 7 healthy males who received both drug2 and drug3 under steady-state conditions . 
drug1 , a drug2 , may antagonize the bactercidal effect of drug3 and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided . 
Prolonged recovery time may occur if drug1 and/or drug2 are used concurrently with drug3 . 
drug1 is clinically compatible with the commonly used general and local drug2 when an adequate respiratory exchange is maintained . 
No formal drug/drug interaction studies with drug1 were performed . 
Cytochrome P-450 is not known to be involved in the metabolism of drug1 . 
drug1 is highly bound to plasma proteins ( 96 to 99 % ) . 
Laboratory Tests Response to drug1 should be monitored by measuring serum total drug2 concentrations just prior to administration on Day 29 and every 8 weeks thereafter . 
Serum transaminase levels should be obtained before starting treatment with drug1 and periodically during treatment . 
Periodic measurement of serum PSA levels may also be considered . 
The renal effects of nephrotoxic compounds may be potentiated by drug1 . 
Many other medicines may increase or decrease the effects of drug1 or affect your condition . 
Before taking drug1 , tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines : - drug2 or another drug3 such as drug4 ( drug5 ) , drug6 ( drug7 , others ) , drug8 ( drug9 ) , drug10 ( drug11 ) , or drug12 ( drug13 ) ;

or - over-the-counter cough , cold , allergy , or weight loss medications . 
You may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring if you are taking any of the medicines listed above . 
Drugs other than those listed here may also interact with drug1 or affect your condition . 
Talk to your doctor and pharmacist before taking any prescription or over-the-counter medicines , including herbal products . 
drug1 : In a prospective study involving six-healthy-male volunteers , drug2 did not affect the metabolism of drug3 . 
These six volunteers received drug1 alone ( 60 mg twice daily ) for 8 days , followed by drug2 in combination with drug3 ( 500 mg once daily ) for 10 days . 
( Both drugs were thus dosed to steady state . ) 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 and its acid metabolite and the electrocardiographic QT c interval were measured during both periods : with drug2 alone , and with drug3 plus drug4 . 
In five men , drug1 levels were undetectable ( 5 ng/mL ) throughout the study ; 
in one man , the C max of drug1 was 8.1 ng/mL with drug2 alone and 7.2 ng/mL with drug3 plus drug4 . 
The mean C max , T max , and AUC of the acid metabolite of drug1 were not significantly changed . 
The mean QT c interval ( msec ) was 369 with drug1 alone and 367 with drug2 plus drug3 . 
Also , in vitro experiments demonstrated a lack of interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
Thus , the interaction observed between drug1 and drug2 is not expected for drug3 . 
Serious cardiac dysrhythmias , some resulting in death , have occurred in patients receiving drug1 concomitantly with other drug2 . 
In addition , most drug1 are contraindicated in patients receiving drug2 therapy who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities ( arrhythmia , bradycardia , QT c interval prolongation , ischemic heart disease , congestive heart failure , etc. ) or electrolyte disturbances . 
drug1 : Following co-administration of two 250-mg drug2 tablets administered once daily with 200-mg drug3 tablets administered twice daily for 10 days to 14 healthy subjects , the steady-state plasma concentration of drug4 was not significantly altered . 
In general , most patients treated with drug1 who are receiving concomitant drug2 therapy may not require empiric adjustment of drug3 dosage or monitoring of drug4 plasma concentrations . 
However , drug1 plasma concentrations should be monitored , with dosage adjustment as appropriate , in patients whose pulmonary disease requires maintaining a given drug2 plasma concentration for optimal pulmonary function or in patients with drug3 concentrations at the higher end of the therapeutic range . 
drug1 or drug2 : When drug3 is administered immediately following drug4 or drug5 , the absorption of drug6 is slightly enhanced . 
The following drug interactions have been reported with drug1 products . 
It is presently not known whether these same drug interactions occur with drug1 . 
Until further data are available regarding the potential interaction of drug1 with these compounds , caution should be used during coadministration . 
drug1 : drug2 has been reported to decrease the clearance of drug3 and , thus , may increase the pharmacologic effect of drug4 . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 has been reported to result in elevated drug4 serum levels . 
drug1 : There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when drug2 and oral drug3 were used concomitantly . 
Increased anticoagulation effects due to a drug interaction with drug1 may be more pronounced in the elderly . 
drug1 : Concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 or drug4 has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia . 
Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of drug1 and other medications , including drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 . 
Injection There is inadequate systematic experience with the use of drug1 injection in combination with other medications to predict specific drug-drug interactions . 
Interactions attributed to the combined use of drug1 injection and epidural drug2 include hypotension and dyspnea . 
SIDE EFFECTS ( drug1 ) The most common adverse reaction during treatment with drug2 is transient drowsiness ( 10-63 % ) . 
In one controlled study of 175 patients , transient drowsiness was observed in 63 % of those receiving drug1 tablets compared to 36 % of those in the placebo group . 
Other common adverse reactions are dizziness ( 5-15 % ) , weakness ( 5-15 % ) and fatigue ( 2-4 % ) . 
Others reported : Neuropsychiatric : Confusion ( 1-11 % ) , headache ( 4-8 % ) , insomnia ( 2-7 % ) ; 
and , rarely , euphoria , excitement , depression , hallucinations , paresthesia , muscle pain , tinnitus , slurred speech , coordination disorder , tremor , rigidity , dystonia , ataxia , blurred vision , nystagmus , strabismus , miosis , mydriasis , diplopia , dysarthria , epileptic seizure .

and , rarely , dry mouth , anorexia , taste disorder , abdominal pain , vomiting , diarrhea , and positive test for occult blood in stool . 
Genitourinary : Urinary frequency ( 2-6 % ) ; 
and , rarely , enuresis , urinary retention , dysuria , impotence , inability to ejaculate , nocturia , hematuria . 
Other : Instances of rash , pruritus , ankle edema , excessive perspiration , weight gain , nasal congestion . 
Some of the CNS and genitourinary symptoms may be related to the underlying disease rather than to drug therapy . 
The following laboratory tests have been found to be abnormal in a few patients receiving drug1 : increased SGOT , elevated alkaline phosphatase , and elevation of blood sugar . 
The adverse experience profile seen with drug1 was similar to that seen with drug2 tablets . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 . 
drug1 has been shown to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 and the pharmacodynamics of drug3 and drug4 . 
Thus no dosing adjustments are necessary during concomitant use with these agents . 
Because drug1 is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system , inhibitors of CYP450 enzyme would not be expected to affect its metabolism , and drug2 and drug3 , potent inhibitors of CYP3A and 2C9 , respectively , have been shown to have no effect on drug4 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 also has no effect on drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 ( up to 400 mg b.i.d. or 800 mg q.d. ) doses have been safely used concomitantly with a drug2 ( drug3 ) . 
drug1 doses of up to 300 mg b.i.d. have been safely used concomitantly with sustained-release drug2 ( sustained-release drug3 ) with no clinically significant adverse interactions . 
When administered concurrently , the following drugs may interact with drug1 . 
drug1 or drug2 ( drug3 and related drugs , drug4 and drug5 ) enhanced hypokalemia . 
Check serum potassium levels at frequent intervals ; 
use drug1 supplements if necessary . 
drug1 enhanced possibility of arrhythmias or drug2 toxicity associated with hypokalemia . 
Monitor serum potassium levels ; 
use drug1 supplements if necessary . 
Oral drug1 decreased prothrombin time response . 
Monitor prothrombin levels and adjust drug1 dosage accordingly . 
drug1 ( oral agents and drug2 ) diminished antidiabetic effect . 
Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia ; 
adjust dosage of drug1 upward if necessary . 
drug1 increased ulcerogenic effect ; 
decreased pharmacologic effect of drug1 . 
Rarely drug1 toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue drug2 after concurrent high-dose drug3 therapy . 
Monitor drug1 levels or the therapeutic effect for which drug2 is given ; 
adjust drug1 dosage accordingly if effect is altered . 
drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 increased metabolic clearance of drug4 because of the induction of hepatic enzymes . 
Observe the patient for possible diminished effect of drug1 and increase the drug2 dosage accordingly . 
drug1 ( particularly C-17 alkylated drug2 such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and similar compounds ) enhanced tendency toward edema . 
Use caution when giving these drugs together , especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease . 
drug1 neurological complications and lack of antibody response . 
drug1 increased levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin , thereby increasing the bound ( inactive ) fraction ; 
this effect is at least balanced by decreased metabolism of drug1 . 
When drug1 therapy is initiated , a reduction in drug2 dosage may be required , and increased amounts may be required when drug3 is terminated . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 may affect the nitrobluetetrazolium test for bacterial infection and produce false-negative results

drug1 , drug2 , drug3 salts , and drug4 may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of drug5 . 
drug1 may cause hypoglycemia , which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia . 
In addition , under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , the signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent . 
drug1 and drug2 - drug3 may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with drug4 overdosage or in those taking drug5 . 
Theoretically , it may decrease hepatic toxicity in the case of other potential hepatotoxic drugs , as well . 
drug1 - drug2 may protect against the ototoxic effects of drug3 . 
drug1 : Administration of drug2 to volunteers under fasting conditions , or with drug3 suspension yielded similar serum drug4 time profiles in young subjects ( n=12 ) . 
In geriatric subjects ( n=7 ) there was a reduction in the rate but not the extent of drug1 absorption . 
drug1 : drug2 like other drug3 , has been shown to affect bleeding parameters in patients receiving drug4 , and serious clinical bleeding has been reported . 
The physician should be cautious when administering drug1 to patients taking drug2 . 
drug1 : Concurrent administration of drug2 and drug3 resulted in 50 % lower serum drug4 concentrations . 
This effect of drug1 ( which also lowers serum concentrations of other drug2 given with it ) has been demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( n= 15 ) as well as normal volunteers ( n= 16 ) . 
Concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 is therefore not recommended . 
drug1 : The effect of drug2 on blood pressure response to drug3 and drug4 was evaluated in men with mild uncomplicated hypertension ( n = 10 ) . 
drug1 pretreatment attenuated the hypotensive effect of a single dose of drug2 but not drug3 . 
drug1 did not appear to affect the beta-blocker-mediated reduction in heart rate . 
drug1 did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug , and the mechanism under lying the interference with drug2 s hypotensive effect is unknown . 
Patients taking both drug1 and a drug2 should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved . 
drug1 , drug2 : In normal volunteers ( n=9 ) , pretreatment with drug3 or drug4 did not affect drug5 pharmacokinetics except that a small ( 13 % ) but statistically significant increase in the area under the serum concentration curve of drug6 resulted with drug7 . 
drug1 : Studies of concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 to healthy men ( n= 14 ) did not show a change in the steady state serum levels of either drug . 
drug1 : Studies in normal volunteers have shown that drug2 like other drug3 , can interfere with the effects of drug4 . 
Although results have varied from study to study , effects have been shown on drug1 -stimulated diuresis , natriuresis , and kaliuresis . 
Other drug1 that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis have been shown to interfere with drug2 in some studies and with drug3 . 
Patients receiving drug1 and drug2 or other drug3 should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained .

drug1 - drug2 and the drug3 drug4 may have synergistic antidepressant activity if used concomitantly . 
drug1 - drug2 may potentiate the tardive dyskinesia side reactions of drug3 if used concomitantly with them . 
drug1 has been shown in vivo to induce CYP3A4 . 
Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A4 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with drug1 ( drug2 ) . 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that drug1 inhibits 2C9 , 2C19 , and 3A4 isozymes in the range of observed drug2 plasma concentrations . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drugs primarily metabolized by these isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug . 
Therefore , appropriate dose adjustments may be necessary for these drugs . 
Drugs which induce CYP3A4 activity ( eg , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 ) would be expected to increase the clearance of drug4 resulting in lowered plasma concentrations . 
Drug interactions with drug1 are summarized in Table 5 .

These drugs include the drug1 and other drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , oral drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , and drug12 . 
When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving drug1 , the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control . 
When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving drug1 in combination with drug2 or drug3 , patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia . 
drug1 ( e. g. , drug2 ) and drug3 containing carbohydrate-splitting enzymes ( e. g. , drug4 , drug5 ) may reduce the effect of drug6 and should not be taken concomitantly . 
drug1 has been shown to change the bioavailabillty drug2 when they are co-administered , which may require drug3 dose adjustment . 
Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that drug1 has no effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
drug1 did not interfere with the absorption or disposition of the drug2 drug3 in diabetic patients . 
drug1 may affect drug2 bioavailabillty and may require dose adjustment of drug3 by 16 % ( 90 % confidence interval : 8-23 % ) , decrease mean C max drug4 by 26 % ( 90 % confidence interval : 16-34 % ) and decrease mean trough concentrations of drug5 by 9 % ( 90 % confidence limit : 19 % decrease to 2 % increase ) . 
The amount of drug1 absorbed while taking drug2 was bioequivalent to the amount absorbed when taking placebo , as indicated by the plasma AUC values . 
However , the peak plasma level of drug1 was reduced by approximately 20 % when taking drug2 due to a slight delay in the absorption of drug3 . 
There is little if any clinically significant interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 ) , drug4 ( e.g. , drug5 ) , local drug6 ( e.g. , drug7 and drug8 ) , drug9 ( drug10 ) -containing preparations ( e.g. , sunscreens and some drug11 ) , drug12 ( e.g. , drug13 ) , drug14 ( sulfa medicines ) , drug15 ( use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results ) , and pancreatic supplements ( use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results ) . 
Known drug interactions include drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 . 
drug1 and drug2 may interact with drug3 In studies with male rats , drug4 was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day . 
Therefore , drug1 has the potential to prolong the biological half-lives of drugs for which the rate of elimination is dependent on the microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme system . 
Interacts with drug1 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with drug1 . 
May interact with the following : drug1 ( these medicines may make your condition worse and prevent the drug2 from working properly ) and drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 ( these medicines may increase the risk of heart problems ) . 
Interactions for drug1 ( drug2 ) : drug3 Therapy : drug4 may potentiate the effects of drug5 and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension . 
drug1 : Concomitant drug2 may decrease the metabolic clearance of drug3 . 
The clinical relevance of this finding is unclear . 
Other : Concomitant drug1 or hot drinks may increase the side effects of flushing and pruritus and should be avoided at the time of drug ingestion . 
The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of drug1 . drug2 drug3 of class ( e.g. drug4 ) , drug5 drug6 ( e.g. drug7 ) , drug8 . 
drug1 , drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 ) , drug4 and drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and other drugs having anticholinergic activity . 
drug1 antagonize the effects of drug2 . 
drug1 in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corti costeroids . . 
drug1 may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs , such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of drug2 ; 
increased serum drug1 concentrations may result . 
drug1 may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility , such as drug2 . 
Because drug1 may interfere with the absorption of drug2 , simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided . 
The inhibiting effects of drug1 on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion . 
No dose adjustment is necessary when drug1 is added to triple-immunosuppression regimens including drug2 , drug3 , and either drug4 or drug5 . 
Three clinical trials have investigated drug1 use in combination with triple-therapy regimens . 
Pharmacokinetics were assessed in two of these trials . 
Total body clearance of drug1 was reduced by an average 22 % and 51 % when drug2 and drug3 , respectively , were added to a regimen consisting of drug4 , USP ( MODIFIED ) and drug5 . 
Nonetheless , the range of individual drug1 clearance values in the presence of drug2 ( 12-57 mL/h ) or drug3 ( 7-54 mL/h ) did not extend outside the range observed with dual therapy ( 10-78 mL/h ) . 
The following medications have been administered in clinical trials with drug1 with no increase in adverse reactions : ATG/ALG , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of drug3 . 
Drug Interactions with drug1 : Concomitant use of drug2 with drug3 should be avoided . 
If the drugs are used together , caution should be exercised because unexpected hypotension could result from beta-blocker inhibition of the sympathetic reflex response to drug1 . 
Drug Interactions , General : Although there have been no formal interaction studies , intravenous drug1 has been administered safely with drugs such as drug2 and sublingual drug3 . 
There is limited experience with concomitant drug1 such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ( both drug6 -like and loop ) . 
No significant drug interactions have been reported in studies of drug1 given with other drugs such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and oral drug7 in healthy volunteers , or given with drug8 to patients with heart failure ( NYHA class II and III ) . 
Because drug1 is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P450 enzymes , interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected . 
drug1 Reversible increases in serum drug2 concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of drug3 with drug4 , and with some drug5 . 
An increase in serum drug1 concentration has been reported during concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 , so careful monitoring of serum drug4 levels is recommended during concomitant use . 
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect drug1 : Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are responsible for drug2 metabolism . 
Inhibitors of CYP1A2 : Concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 , an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of drug3 . 
Some drug1 would be expected to have similar effects and these combinations should be avoided . 
Inhibitors of CYP2D6 : Because CYP2D6 is involved in drug1 metabolism , concomitant use of drug2 with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher concentrations of drug3 . 
drug1 ( 20 mg QD ) increased the concentration of drug2 ( 40 mg QD ) by about 60 % , and greater degrees of inhibition are expected with higher doses of drug3 . 
Similar effects would be expected with other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 ) . 
Potential for drug1 to Affect Other Drugs : Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2 : In vitro drug interaction studies demonstrate that drug2 does not induce CYP1A2 activity , and it is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates . 
Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 : drug1 is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 . 
When drug1 was administered ( at a dose of 60 mg BID ) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of drug2 , a CYP2D6 substrate , the AUC of drug3 increased 3-fold . 
Therefore , co-administration of drug1 with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index , including certain drug2 ( drug3 [ drug4 ] , such as drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 ) , drug8 and drug9 ( e.g. , drug10 , drug11 ) , should be approached with caution . 
Plasma drug1 concentrations may need to be monitored and the dose of the drug2 may need to be reduced if a drug3 is co-administered with drug4 . 
Because of the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 should not be co-administered . 
Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A : Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that drug1 does not inhibit or induce CYP3A activity . 
drug1 May Have a Clinically Important Interaction with the Following Other Drugs : drug2 : When drug3 and drug4 were administered several hours apart so that peak concentrations of each would coincide , drug5 did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by drug6 . 
In the drug1 clinical trials database , three drug2 -treated patients had liver injury as manifested by ALT and total bilirubin elevations , with evidence of obstruction . 
Substantial intercurrent drug1 use was present in each of these cases , and this may have contributed to the abnormalities seen . 
CNS Acting Drugs : Given the primary CNS effects of drug1 , it should be used with caution when it is taken in combination with or substituted for other centrally acting drugs , including those with a similar mechanism of action . 
Potential for Interaction with Drugs that Affect Gastric Acidity : drug1 has an enteric coating that resists dissolution until reaching a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the pH exceeds 5.5 . 
In extremely acidic conditions , drug1 , unprotected by the enteric coating , may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol . 
Caution is advised in using drug1 in patients with conditions that may slow gastric emptying ( e.g. , some diabetics ) . 
Drugs that raise the gastrointestinal pH may lead to an earlier release of drug1 . 
However , co-administration of drug1 with drug2 - and drug3 -containing drug4 ( 51 mEq ) or drug5 with drug6 , had no significant effect on the rate or extent of drug7 absorption after administration of a 40-mg oral dose . 
It is unknown whether the concomitant administration of drug1 affects drug2 absorption . 
In studies in normal volunteers , there was no pharmacodynamic interaction between intravenous drug1 and either drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
However , drug1 has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of drug2 and drug3 . 
Since drug1 inhibits platelet function , there is a potential for increased risk of bleeding , particularly in patients maintained on drug2 . 
During clinical trials , drug1 was used concurrently with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , and other medications . 
Intravenous infusion of drug1 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 did not alter the clearance ( pharmacokinetics ) of drug2 . 
Although clinical studies have not been conducted , in vitro studies of drug1 indicate that no relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 drug metabolism would be expected . 
Oral drug1 Multiple doses of drug2 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 , the estrogenic component in most oral drug4 . 
Although the clinical significance is not known , it is not recommended that drug1 be taken concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : Co-administration of a single dose of intravenously administered drug2 ( 20 mg ) reduced the oral absorption of a single 400 mg dose of drug3 administered following a meal , as evidenced by a 27 % decrease in mean Cmax and a 22 % decrease in mean AUC . 
Although the clinical significance is not known , it is not recommended that drug1 be taken concomitantly with drug2 . 
drug1 : As with other drug2 , co-administration of drug3 with drug4 resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of drug5 , with a 49 % increase in mean Cmax , a 122 % increase in mean AUC , and a 53 % increase in half-life . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs test . 
A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests ( Benedicts or Fehlings solution or with CLINITEST tablets ) , but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria ( e.g. , CLINISTIX , TES-TAPE ) . 
As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test , it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving drug1 . 
drug1 has been studied in several human drug interaction studies in which it was administered with a meal and the test drug . 
drug1 was found to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 
drug1 decreased the Cmax and AUC of sustained-release drug2 ( drug3 ) by approximately 31 % and 11 % , respectively . 
Since there is a high degree of variability in the bioavailability of drug1 , the clinical significance of this finding is unclear . 
In clinical studies , coadministration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 did not interfere with the lipid-lowering activity of the drug5 . 
Other drugs have not been studied . 
When administering other drugs for which alterations in blood levels could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy , physicians should consider monitoring drug levels or effects . 
drug1 should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other drug2 or drug3 , including drug4 , drug5 and drug6 , or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder ( including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia ) . 
drug1 has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 . 
Drug Laboratory Test Interactions : Prolongation of the template bleeding time has been reported during continuous intravenous infusion of drug1 at dosages exceeding 24 g/day . 
Platelet function studies in these patients have not demonstrated any significant platelet dysfunction . 
However , in vitro studies have shown that at high concentrations ( 7.4 mMol/L or 0.97 mg/mL and greater ) drug1 inhibits ADP and collagen-induced platelet aggregation , the release of ATP and serotonin , and the binding of fibrinogen to the platelets in a concentration-response manner . 
Following a 10 g bolus of drug1 , transient peak plasma concentrations of 4.6 mMol/L or 0.60 mg/mL have been obtained . 
The concentration of drug1 necessary to maintain inhibition of fibrinolysis is 0.99 mMol/L or 0.13 mg/mL . 
Administration of a 5 g bolus followed by 1 to 1.25 g/hr should achieve and sustain plasma levels of 0.13 mg/mL . 
Thus , concentrations which have been obtained in vivo clinically in patients with normal renal function are considerably lower than the in vitro concentrations found to induce abnormalities in platelet function tests . 
However , higher plasma concentrations of drug1 may occur in patients with severe renal failure . 
Certain drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
No information available

fucking empty sentence 
Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions As with drug1 , high concentrations of drug2 ( 100 micrograms/mL ) may interfere with measurement of serum and urine creatinine levels by the Jaff reaction , and produce false increases of modest degree in the levels of creatinine reported . 
Serum samples from patients treated with drug1 should not be analyzed for creatinine if withdrawn within 2 hours of drug administration . 
High concentrations of drug1 in the urine may interfere with measurement of urinary 17-hydroxy-corticosteroids by the Porter-Silber reaction , and produce false increases of modest degree in the levels reported . 
A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur . 
This has been observed with CLINITEST reagent tablets

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Positive direct Coombs tests have been reported during treatment with the drug1 . 
In hematologic studies or in transfusion cross-matching procedures when anti-globulin tests are performed on the minor side or in Coombs testing of newborns whose mothers have received drug1 before parturition , it should be recognized that a positive Coombs test may be due to the drug . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None known . 
Drug-Drug Interactions drug1 : Concomitant use of drug2 is contraindicated . 
drug1 at 400 mg BID ( the usual prescription dose ) co-administered with drug2 ( 500 mcg BID ) for 7 days has been shown to increase drug3 plasma levels by 58 % . 
drug1 at doses of 100 mg BID ( OTC dose ) resulted in a 13 % increase in drug2 plasma levels ( 500 mcg single dose ) . 
No studies have been conducted at intermediate doses of drug1 . 
If a patient requires drug1 and drug2 therapy , it is suggested that drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 ( drug6 and drug7 s ) be used as alternatives to drug8 , as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of drug9 . 
drug1 : Concomitant use of drug2 is contraindicated . 
Co-administration of drug1 with drug2 resulted in increases in drug3 peak plasma levels of 42 % , although overall exposure to drug4 was not significantly increased . 
In an analysis of the supraventricular arrhythmia and DIAMOND patient populations , the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes . 
drug1 : Concomitant use of drug2 is contraindicated . 
drug1 at 400 mg daily ( the maximum approved prescription dose ) co-administered with drug2 ( 500 mcg BID ) for 7 days has been shown to increase drug3 Cmax by 53 % in males and 97 % in females , and AUC by 41 % in males and 69 % in females . 
drug1 Alone or in Combination with drug2 : Concomitant use of drug3 alone or in combination with drug4 is contraindicated . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) Alone or in Combination with drug3 : Concomitant use of drug4 alone or in combination with drug5 is contraindicated . 
drug1 50 mg QD or drug2 / drug3 50/100 mg QD was co-administered with drug4 ( 500 mcg BID ) for 5 days ( following 2 days of drug5 use at half dose ) . 
In patients receiving drug1 alone , drug2 AUC increased by 27 % and Cmax by 21 % . 
However , the pharmacodynamic effect increased by 197 % ( QTc increase over time ) and by 95 % ( maximum QTc increase ) . 
However , the pharmacodynamic effect increased by 190 % ( QTc increase over time ) and by 84 % ( Maximum QTc increase ) . 
The pharmacodynamic effects can be explained by a combination of the increase in drug1 exposure and the reductions in serum potassium . 
In the DIAMOND trials , 1252 patients were treated with drug1 and drug2 concomitantly of whom 493 died compared to 508 deaths among the 1248 patients receiving placebo and drug3 . 
Of the 229 patients who had drug1 added to their concomitant medications in the DIAMOND trials , the patients on drug2 had a non-significantly reduced relative risk for death of 0.68 ( 95 % CI 0.376 , 1.230 ) . 
Potential Drug Interactions drug1 is eliminated in the kidney by cationic secretion . 
Inhibitors of renal cationic secretion are contraindicated with drug1 . 
In addition , drugs that are actively secreted via this route ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ) should be co-administered with care as they might increase drug4 levels . 
drug1 is metabolized to a small extent by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 system . 
Inhibitors of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme could increase systemic drug1 exposure . 
Inhibitors of this isoenzyme ( e.g. , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , grapefruit juice , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 ) should be cautiously coadministered with drug12 as they can potentially increase drug13 levels . 
drug1 is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 nor of other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( e.g. , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 ) and is not expected to increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 . 
Other Drug Interaction Information drug1 : Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that drug2 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
In patients , the concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes . 
It is not clear whether this represents an interaction with drug1 or the presence of more severe structural heart disease in patients on drug2 ; 
structural heart disease is a known risk factor for arrhythmia . 
No increase in mortality was observed in patients taking drug1 as concomitant medication . 
Other Drugs : In healthy volunteers , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , hormone replacement therapy ( a combination of conjugated drug6 and drug7 ) , drug8 ( drug9 and drug10 s ) and drug11 did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug12 . 
In addition , studies in healthy volunteers have shown that drug1 does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drug2 , or the pharmacokinetics of drug3 ( 40 mg twice daily ) , drug4 , drug5 , or oral drug6 . 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted on plasma concentration data from 1445 patients in clinical trials to examine the effects of concomitant medications on clearance or volume of distribution of drug1 . 
Concomitant medications were grouped as drug1 , oral drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , inducers of CYP3A4 , substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4 , substrates and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , substrates and inhibitors of tubular organic cation transport , and QTc-prolonging drugs . 
Differences in clearance between patients on these medications ( at any occasion in the study ) and those off medications varied between -16 % and +3 % . 
The mean clearances of drug1 were 16 % and 15 % lower in patients on drug2 and inhibitors of tubular organic cation transport , respectively . 
The CNS effects of drug1 may be enhanced by drug2 . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 may enhance the effects of : other drug4 s , drug5 , general drug6 , drug7 such as drug8 , drug9 , or other drug10 , causing increased CNS depression . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid . 
Use of drug1 may cause an excessive increase in blood pressure and heart stimulation . 
If you are also using a drug1 inhaler , take drug2 first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the drug3 inhaler . 
This allows drug1 to open air passages , increasing the effectiveness of the drug2 . 
drug1 : Patients on drug2 , especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted , may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with drug3 . 
The possibility of hypotensive effects with drug1 can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug2 or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug3 . 
If this is not possible , the starting dose should be reduced . 
drug1 Supplements and drug2 Lotensin can attenuate potassium loss caused by drug3 . 
drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and others ) or drug5 supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . 
Therefore , if concomitant use of such agents is indicated , they should be given with caution , and the patient 's serum potassium should be monitored frequently . 
Oral drug1 Interaction studies with drug2 and drug3 failed to identify any clinically important effects on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these drug4 . 
drug1 : Increased serum drug2 levels and symptoms of drug3 toxicity have been reported in patients receiving drug4 during therapy with drug5 . 
These drugs should be coadministered with caution , and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 levels is recommended . 
If a drug1 is also used , the risk of drug2 toxicity may be increased . 
Other No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when drug1 was administered concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , or drug9 . 
drug1 has been used concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 , without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions . 
drug1 , like other drug2 , has had less than additive effects with drug3 , presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system 
. 
fucking empty sentence 
Elevated plasma levels of drug1 have been reported with concomitant use of some drug2 . 
There have been reports of drug1 -related side-effects in patients on concomitant drug2 - drug3 therapy . 
Therefore , monitoring of drug1 plasma levels should be considered and dosage of drug2 adjusted as required . 
drug1 have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of drug2 . 
This may lead to reduced clearance of drug1 and a prolongation of its plasma half-life . 
Although this interaction has not been reported with drug1 , caution should be exercised when drug2 is given concomitantly with drug3 -containing products . 
drug1 or drug2 substantially interfere with the absorption of some drug3 , resulting in low urine levels . 
Also , concomitant administration of drug1 with products containing drug2 , drug3 containing drug4 , or drug5 ( drug6 ) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels . 
drug1 , including drug2 , may enhance the effects of oral drug3 , such as drug4 or its derivatives . 
When these products are administered concomitantly , prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored . 
Seizures have been reported in patients taking another drug1 and the drug2 drug3 concurrently . 
Animal studies also suggest an increased potential for seizures when these 2 drugs are given concomitantly . 
drug1 is not approved in the United States at this time . 
Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when drug1 and certain drug2 are administered concomitantly . 
Elevated drug1 serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of drug2 and drug3 . 
Special consideration should be given to the administration of drug1 in patients receiving drug2 or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension . 
The administration of local drug1 containing drug2 or drug3 to patients receiving drug4 or drug5 may produce severe , prolonged hypertension . 
drug1 and drug2 may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of drug3 . 
Concurrent use of these agents should generally be avoided . 
In situations when concurrent therapy is necessary , careful patient monitoring is essential . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 ( for the treatment of hypotension related to obstetric blocks ) and drug2 may cause severe , persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents . 
Due to the potential for additive effects , caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving drug1 concomitantly with other agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction . 
Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using drug1 or drug2 concomitantly with drug3 . 
As with all drugs , care should be exercised when treating patients with multiple medications . 
drug1 is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme system . 
Other drugs that are specific substrates , inhibitors , or inducers of the enzyme system may have a significant impact on the efficacy and side effect profile of drug1 . 
Patients taking other drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4 , especially patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment , may require dosage adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered drug1 in order to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels . 
drug1 
Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 is usually well tolerated , but available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities . 
Administration of drug1 concomitantly with drug2 in five normal volunteers resulted in increased drug3 levels in all subjects and bioavailability of drug4 was increased approximately 50 % . 
In vitro , drug1 appears to be displaced from its binding sites by drug2 . 
If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with drug1 , an adjustment in the drug2 dose may be warranted . 
drug1 
A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak drug1 plasma levels ( 58 % ) and AUC ( 53 % ) after a 1-week course of drug2 1200 mg/day and a single dose of drug3 60mg . 
drug1 produced smaller , nonsignificant increases . 
The effect may be mediated by drug1 s known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P-450 , the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of drug2 . 
Patients currently receiving drug1 therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with drug2 . 
An adjustment in the drug1 dose may be warranted . 
drug1 
Administration of drug1 with drug2 in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma drug3 concentrations approximately 20 % . 
Another investigator found no increase in drug1 levels in 12 patients with coronary artery disease . 
Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of drug1 levels , it is recommended that drug2 levels be monitored when initiating , adjusting , and discontinuing drug3 therapy to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization . 
drug1 
The depression of cardiac contractility , conductivity , and automaticity as well as the vascular dilation associated with drug1 may be potentiated by drug2 . 
When used concomitantly , drug1 and drug2 should be titrated carefully . 
drug1 
A pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients . 
In renal and cardiac transplant recipients , a reduction of drug1 dose ranging from 15 % to 48 % was necessary to maintain drug2 trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of drug3 . 
If these agents are to be administered concurrently , drug1 concentrations should be monitored , especially when drug2 therapy is initiated , adjusted , or discontinued . 
The effect of drug1 on drug2 plasma concentrations has not been evaluated . 
drug1 
Concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of drug3 ( 40 % to 72 % increase ) , resulting in toxicity in some cases . 
Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction . 
drug1 
Studies showed that drug1 increased the AUC of drug2 and drug3 by 3-4 fold and the Cmax by 2-fold , compared to placebo . 
The elimination half life of drug1 and drug2 also increased ( 1.5-2.5 fold ) during coadministration with drug3 . 
These pharmacokinetic effects seen during drug1 coadministration can result in increased clinical effects ( e.g. , prolonged sodation ) of both drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 
In a ten-subject study , coadministration of drug1 ( 120 mg bid ) with drug2 resulted in a 3-4 times increase in mean drug3 AUC and Cmax vs. drug4 alone ; 
no change in drug1 AUC and Cmax was observed during drug2 coadministration . 
drug1 plasma levels were not significantly affected by drug2 or drug3 . 
drug1 
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 lowered the drug3 plasma concentrations to undetectable levels . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible , and alternative therapy considered . 
drug1 drug2 may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ( acidic ) or drug6 ( basic ) , as well as drug7 drug8 , drug9 , thyroid and drug10 preparations , drug11 and drug12 , and drug13 . 
Interference with the absorption of oral drug1 supplements has been observed with another positively-charged bile acid sequestrant . 
drug1 drug2 may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of drugs that undergo enterohepatic circulation , The discontinuance of drug3 drug4 could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug such as drug5 has been filtrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking drug6 drug7 . 
Because drug1 binds bile acids , drug2 drug3 may interfere with normal fat digestion and absorption and thus may prevent absorption of drug4 such as A , D , E , and K . 
When drug1 drug2 is given for long periods of time , concomitant supplementation with water-miscible ( or parenteral ) forms of drug3 should be considered . 
SINCE drug1 drug2 MAY BIND OTHER DRUGS GIVEN CONCURRENTLY , IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PATIENTS TAKE OTHER DRUGS AT LEAST 1 HOUR BEFORE OR 4 TO 6 HOURS AFTER drug3 drug4 ( OR AT AS GREAT AN INTERVAL AS POSSIBLE ) TO AVOID IMPEDING THEIR ABSORPTION . 
CYP3A4 Interactions 
drug1 is metabolized by CYP3A4 but has no CYP3A4 inhibitory activity ; 
therefore it is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 . 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( below ) increase the risk of myopathy by reducing the elimination of drug1 .

The risk of myopathy is also increased by the following lipid-lowering drugs that are not potent CYP3A4 inhibitors , but which can cause myopathy when given alone . 
See WARNINGS , Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis . 
drug1 Other drug2 drug3 ( drug4 ) ( =1 g/day ) 
Other drug interactions 
drug1 : The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of drug2 particularly with higher doses of drug3 ( see WARNINGS , Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis ) . 
drug1 or drug2 : The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either drug3 or drug4 is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the drug5 ( see WARNINGS , Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis ) . 
drug1 s : In a small clinical trial in which drug2 was administered to drug3 treated patients , no effect on prothrombin time was detected . 
However , another drug1 has been found to produce a less than two-second increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of drug2 . 
Also , bleeding and/or increased prothrombin time have been reported in a few patients taking drug1 s concomitantly with drug2 . 
It is recommended that in patients taking drug1 , prothrombin time be determined before starting drug2 and frequently enough during early therapy to insure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs . 
Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented , prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on drug1 . 
If the dose of drug1 is changed , the same procedure should be repeated . 
drug1 therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking drug2 . 
drug1 : In normal volunteers , there was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with concomitant administration of single doses of drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : In patients with hypercholesterolemia , concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 resulted in no effect on drug4 plasma concentrations . 
Oral drug1 : In pharmacokinetic studies of drug2 in hypercholesterolemic noninsulin dependent diabetic patients , there was no drug interaction with drug3 or with drug4 
CNS Drugs - Given the primary CNS effects of drug1 , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs . 
drug1 - Although drug2 did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of drug3 in a clinical trial , as with other drug4 , the use of drug5 by patients taking drug6 is not recommended . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) 
Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis ( drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , etc . ) 
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis . 
Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of drug1 that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an drug2 or drug3 potentiated the risk of bleeding . 
Thus , patients should be cautioned about the use of such drugs concurrently with drug1 . 
drug1 - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day racemic drug2 , combined administration of 400 mg/day drug3 for 8 days resulted in an increase in drug4 AUC and Cmax of 43 % and 39 % , respectively . 
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown . 
drug1 - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day racemic drug2 , combined administration of drug3 and drug4 ( single dose of 1 mg ) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug5 or drug6 . 
drug1 - Coadministration of racemic drug2 ( 40 mg/day for 10 days ) and drug3 ( 30 mmol/day for 5 days ) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug4 or drug5 . 
Nevertheless , plasma drug1 levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the drug2 dose in accordance with standard clinical practice . 
Because drug1 may enhance the serotonergic effects of drug2 , caution should be exercised when drug3 and drug4 are coadministered . 
drug1 and drug2 - In a controlled study , a single dose of drug3 2 mg co-administered with racemic drug4 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to drug5 given alone . 
Racemic drug1 did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of drug2 . 
The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known . 
drug1 - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness , hyperreflexia , and incoordination following the use of a drug2 ( drug3 ) and drug4 . 
If concomitant treatment with drug1 and an drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) is clinically warranted , appropriate observation of the patient is advised . 
drug1 - Combined administration of racemic drug2 ( 40 mg/day for 21 days ) and the CYP1A2 substrate drug3 ( single dose of 300 mg ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug4 . 
The effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 was not evaluated . 
drug1 - Administration of 40 mg/day racemic drug2 for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 , a CYP3A4 substrate . 
Prothrombin time was increased by 5 % , the clinical significance of which is unknown . 
drug1 - Combined administration of racemic drug2 ( 40 mg/day for 14 days ) and drug3 ( titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days ) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drug4 , a CYP3A4 substrate . 
Although trough drug1 plasma levels were unaffected , given the enzyme-inducing properties of drug2 , the possibility that drug3 might increase the clearance of drug4 should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered . 
drug1 - Combined administration of racemic drug2 ( titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days ) and the CYP3A4 substrate drug3 ( single dose of 0.25 mg ) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug4 or drug5 . 
drug1 - Combined administration of racemic drug2 ( 40 mg ) and drug3 ( 200 mg ) decreased the Cmax and AUC of drug4 by 21 % and 10 % , respectively , and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drug5 . 
drug1 - Combined administration of a single dose of drug2 ( 600 mg ) , both a CYP3A4 substrate and a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , and drug3 ( 20 mg ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug4 or drug5 . 
CYP3A4 and -2C19 Inhibitors - In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and -2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of drug1 . 
However , coadministration of drug1 ( 20 mg ) and drug2 ( 600 mg ) , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
Because drug1 is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems , inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease drug2 clearance . 
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P4502D6 - In vitro studies did not reveal an inhibitory effect of drug1 on CYP2D6 . 
In addition , steady state levels of racemic drug1 were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of drug2 , suggesting that coadministration , with drug3 , of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 , is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on drug4 metabolism . 
However , there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for drug1 , i.e. , coadministration of drug2 ( 20 mg/day for 21 days ) with the drug3 drug4 ( single dose of 50 mg ) , a substrate for CYP2D6 , resulted in a 40 % increase in Cmax and a 100 % increase in AUC of drug5 . 
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown . 
Nevertheless , caution is indicated in the coadministration of drug1 and drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 . 
drug1 - Administration of 20 mg/day drug2 for 21 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 50 % increase in Cmax and 82 % increase in AUC of the drug3 drug4 ( given in a single dose of 100 mg ) . 
Increased drug1 plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity . 
Coadministration of drug1 and drug2 had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate . 
Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) - There are no clinical studies of the combined use of ECT and drug1 . 
Concomitant Administration with Racemic drug1 drug2 - Since drug3 is the active isomer of racemic drug4 ( drug5 ) , the two agents should not be coadministered . 
drug1 does not exhibit binding to plasma proteins ( other than thrombin ) or red blood cells . 
In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI , co-administration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications . 
There is no experience with co-administration of drug1 and plasma expanders such as drug2 . 
drug1 should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased risk of bleeding . 
Immunogenicity/Re-exposure : In in vitro studies , drug1 exhibited no platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of HIT/HITTS . 
Among 494 subjects who received drug1 in clinical trials and were tested for antibodies , 2 subjects had treatment-emergent positive drug2 antibody tests . 
Neither subject demonstrated clinical evidence of allergic or anaphylactic reactions and repeat testing was not performed . 
Nine additional patients who had initial positive tests were negative on repeat testing . 
Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions Certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by drug1 -containing oral drug2 . 
The following similar changes may be expected with larger doses of drug1 : - Increased sulfobromophthalein retention 
. 
- Increased prothrombin and factors VII , VIII , IX , and X ; 
decreased drug1 ; 
increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability 
. 
- Increased thyroid-binding globulin ( TBG ) leading to in-creased circulating total thyroid hormone ; 
as measured by PBI , T4 by column , or T4 by radioimmunoassay . 
Free T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG ; 
free T4 concentration is unaltered 
. 
- Impaired glucose tolerance 
. 
- Decreased pregnanediol excretion 
. 
- Reduced response to metyrapone test 
. 
- Reduced serum folate concentration 
. 
- Increased serum triglyceride and phospholipid concentration . 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with drug1 . 
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicate that drug1 is primarily a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A4 , 2C19 , and 1A2 . 
Patients who are concomitantly receiving drug1 and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 should be closely monitored for either toxicities or reduced efficacy . 
During clinical trials , hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were reported in diabetic patients receiving oral drug1 . 
Patients on oral drug1 receiving drug2 treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of the dose of their drug3 . 
Drug Laboratory Test Interactions None known . 
The effects of concomitant drug1 administration on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 ( ' drug2 ' ) is a newly introduced drug3 with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . 
It is extensively metabolized , predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4 . 
Therefore , concurrent administration of drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme may affect drug1 pharmacokinetics . 
This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer drug1 did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of drug2 , resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , or bipolar disorder . 
These results indicate that dosage adjustment of drug1 may be necessary when the two drugs are given concurrently and that caution may be required when administering other drugs that inhibit or induce cytochromes , particularly P450 3A4 . 
[Drug treatment of erection disorders in patients with cardiovascular disease ] Erectile dysfunction is a frequent condition in cardiovascular patients . 
Since the arrival of oral drug1 , patients want to know how safe sexual activity is in cardiovascular disease in general and during use of drug2 in particular . 
Sexual intercourse with a steady partner causes no more cardiovascular risk than normal daily activities such as ironing , 2 kilometers of walking without climbing , paperhanging , playing golf or gardening . 
The relative risk of myocardial infarction during sexual activity is not significantly higher than for healthy persons . 
The incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is not higher among users of drug1 . 
drug1 is contraindicated in patients using drug2 or who may need to use drug3 , because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure . 
No interactions have been observed with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 and drug5 . 
Before prescribing a symptomatic ( pharmaceutical ) treatment for patients with an erection disorder , attention should be given tot the sexological , psychological and medical backgrounds of the disorder . 
Secondary prevention of atherosclerotic risk factors is also important : regulation of blood pressure and blood sugar level , hyperlipidaemia and obesity , as well as a change of lifestyle ( giving up smoking , adapting of diet and more physical exertion ) . 
Patients with a very low cardiac capacity should be advised to refrain from treatment of the erection disorder . 
Failure of drug1 to modify drug2 induced hypertension in sheep . 
Studies in rats have shown that drug1 administration attenuates certain types of drug2 dependent hypertension , including drug3 hypertension . 
The effects of oral drug1 on drug2 induced hypertension were examined in conscious sheep . 
drug1 has no effect on the blood pressure or metabolic responses to drug2 in sheep . 
Pharmacokinetic Interaction between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 in healthy males . 
The objective of this study was to determine if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction when drug1 is given with drug2 or drug3 and to determine the effects of these drugs on the erythromycin breath test ( ERMBT ) . 
Twenty-four healthy male subjects were randomized to one of two cohorts . 
All subjects received drug1 ( 1,200 mg twice a day ) for 4 days , followed by a 7-day washout period , followed by either drug2 ( 300 mg once a day [QD ] ) ( cohort 1 ) or drug3 ( 600 mg QD ) ( cohort 2 ) for 14 days . 
Cohort 1 then received drug1 plus drug2 for 10 days , and cohort 2 received drug3 plus drug4 for 4 days . 
Serial plasma and urine samples for measurement of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 and their drug4 , were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography . 
drug1 did not significantly affect drug2 's pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state ( AUC ( ss ) ) of drug2 by 2.93-fold and the AUC ( ss ) of drug3 by 13.3-fold . 
drug1 significantly decreased the AUC ( ss ) of drug2 by 82 % , but drug3 had no effect on drug4 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 decreased the results of the ERMBT by 83 % . 
The results of the ERMBT after 2 weeks of drug1 and drug2 therapy were increased 187 and 156 % , respectively . 
drug1 plus drug2 was well tolerated . 
drug1 plus drug2 was poorly tolerated , and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy . 
drug1 markedly increases the metabolic clearance of drug2 , and coadministration is contraindicated . 
drug1 significantly decreases clearance of drug2 and drug3 , and the combination is poorly tolerated . 
drug1 inhibits the ERMBT , and drug2 and drug3 are equipotent inducers of the ERMBT . 
[The effect of drug1 on the activity of mixed-function mono-oxidases in the liver microsomes ] The effects of the drug2 --the drug drug3 --on hepatic microsomal monooxygenase activities were studied . 
The agent was found to produce some inhibiting activity against hepatic microsomal 7-ethoxycoumarine deethylase in male Wistar rats in vitro and in vivo experiments . 
When given in a dose of 50 mg/kg , drug1 produced no statistically significant effect on the duration of hexanal-induced sleep in mice . 
The findings suggest that the agent has slight effects on the tested activities . 
Repeated oral administration of drug1 in sheep : interactions of drug2 with drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Interactions between treatments with drug1 , drug2 ( an drug3 ) , drug4 ( an drug5 ) , and drug6 ( an inducer of microsomal enzymes ) were investigated in sheep . 
A daily dose of 2 mg of drug1 /kg of body weight for 6 days did not affect the plasma enzymes or the antiprothrombinemic effect of drug2 in wethers . 
The treatment of ewes with an intravenous ( IV ) injection of drug1 , insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity , appeared to produce additive effects with those produced by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of drug2 /kg/day . 
In ewes given 40 mg of drug1 /kg for 5 days intraperitoneally ( IP ) , the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of drug2 /kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present . 
Treatment with daily doses of 2 mg of drug1 /kg for 6 days did not modify the anticholinesterase effect of a 2nd series of treatments given 6 weeks later . 
Pharmacokinetic profile of drug1 in special populations . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 in healthy normal volunteers has been extensively studied and is well described . 
drug1 is characterised by a high oral bioavailability , low clearance , a small volume of distribution , and a 7-hour half-life . 
It is essentially completely metabolised , therefore little is excreted unchanged . 
drug1 is highly protein bound . 
To investigate the effect of disease states or concomitant drug administration on a patient 's response to drug1 , additional pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in special populations . 
Since drug1 has a well-defined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship , measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters is clinically relevant . 
Data from studies to date show that disease states , underlying conditions , and concomitantly administered highly protein-bound drugs have essentially no effect on drug1 pharmacokinetics . 
Therefore , drug1 can generally be given without the need for dosage modifications in special populations such as uncompromised elderly patients , those with moderate renal impairment , and patients with stable hepatic disease . 
Enhanced drug1 clearance secondary to drug2 therapy . 
This report describes two cases in which drug1 clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant drug2 administration . 
Maximum calculated drug1 clearance ranged from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 times baseline . 
Onset of the interaction began within five days of beginning concurrent therapy . 
With combined use , clinicians should be aware , when drug1 is added , of the potential for reexacerbation of pulmonary symptomatology due to lowered serum drug2 concentrations . 
In vitro activity of drug1 , either singly or in combination with drug2 , against Mycobacterium ulcerans . 
The antimicrobial effect of a drug1 , drug2 , either alone or in combination with drug3 , was evaluated in vitro against two type strains and six clinical isolates of Mycobacterium ulcerans . 
Growth of M . 
ulcerans was measured by plate counts and the BACTEC radiometric method . 
The minimal inhibitory concentration as well as minimal bactericidal concentration of drug1 against M . 
ulcerans was between 0.012 and 0.025 mg/l , while corresponding values for drug1 and drug2 were in the range of 0.1-0.8 mg/l and 0.1-0.4 mg/l respectively . 
When combined with drug1 , drug2 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of drug3 ( or drug4 ) and drug5 . 
These results suggest that drug1 has a great potential in the treatment of M . 
ulcerans infection . 
Pharmacokinetics of drug1 . 
Effective use of drugs in therapy depends not only on clinical acumen but also on the availability of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data . 
Such information assists in development of safe dosing regimens , prediction of abnormal handling of drugs in states of disease and disorder and anticipation of drug interactions . 
For the drug1 now available in the United States ( drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ) , these data appeared well after clinical patterns of use evolved . 
Nonetheless , their relevance continues to be demonstrated by the dependence of each agent on intact liver blood flow and function for normal rates of elimination ; 
by the nonlinear kinetic characteristics for drug1 and drug2 ( and probably for drug3 , as well ) and the derivative implications for decreased dosing frequency requirements ; 
and by observations now appearing on the relation between plasma drug levels and drug effects , both therapeutic and toxic . 
Such data are discussed herein , with emphasis on those aspects that impact on the clinical use of the drug1 . 
Herbal remedies , nephropathies , and renal disease . 
The use of herbal remedies is becoming increasingly popular in the United States . 
Research has shown that herbal remedy use may be associated with acute renal failure . 
In addition , the use of herbal remedies may be detrimental for the patient with compromised renal function . 
Patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure may be at risk for further kidney damage as well as complications related to interactions of herbal remedies with complex renal therapy regimens . 
This article will describe the escalating use of herbal therapy and the hazards of herbal remedy use among patients . 
drug1 and their complications . 
Drugs that suppress the immune system are widely used . 
They are part of the treatment of patients with organ transplants , malignancy , and increasingly those with conditions such as psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , and liver and bowel disease in which inflammation is an aetiological factor . 
Because of the broadening indications for drug1 , and the prolonged survival in conditions for which they are being used , many patients on immunosuppression are now cared for in the community or seen in non-specialist hospitals , usually in close collaboration with a specialist . 
This article looks at five commonly used drug1 in turn ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) , discussing the main , non-infection , unwanted effects , ways to avoid them and what to do if problems arise . 
The management of infection is dealt with as a separate section . 
drug1 and drug2 similarly inhibit and stimulate drug3 - or drug4 -induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium . 
Prostatic epithelium proliferates in a defined medium consisting of basal medium RPMI1640 containing drug1 ( 1 microgram/ml ) , drug2 ( 10 ng/ml ) , and drug3 ( 3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 IU/ml ) . 
Although neither drug1 nor drug2 affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing drug3 alone , they modify the mitogenic effect of drug4 and drug5 . 
drug1 at 10 ( -10 ) M or drug2 at about 3 X 10 ( -9 ) M inhibits proliferation stimulated by drug3 . 
Higher concentrations of drug1 ( 10 ( -8 ) - 10 ( -6 ) M ) or drug2 ( 3 X 10 ( -8 ) - 10 ( -7 ) M ) enhance the mitogenic activity of drug3 . 
drug1 had a similar effect in the presence of drug2 . 
However , drug1 stimulated , but did not significantly inhibit , proliferation in the presence of drug2 . 
These results suggest that both drug1 and drug2 , and possibly other drug3 and drug4 , may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of drug5 and drug6 . 
Death in drug1 users : causes and rates . 
The world medical literature contains 43 reports of deaths associated with drug1 in a 35-year period . 
These included seven cerebrovascular accidents , six sudden cardiac deaths , three cases of hyperpyrexia , eight poisonings of uncertain mechanism and seven cases of medical complications of intravenous injection ; 
the remainder were of uncertain cause . 
In contrast , in Ontario alone , in 1972 and 1973 there were 26 deaths in drug1 users , of which 16 were due to accident suicide or homicide . 
Of the remaining cases , two were cardiac , two hepatic and the rest were mixed drug overdose . 
Pulmonary granulomata , subacute hepatitis and other lesions resulting from intravenous drug use were common findings at autopsy . 
On the basis of the estimated number of regular users of intravenous drug1 in Ontario , the mortality rate in such users is at least four times as high as in the general population of the same age , and is comparable to that in alcoholics and drug2 addicts . 
However , the absolute number of drug1 -related deaths is far greater than the number of deaths in drug2 or drug3 users . 
[A pharmacological analysis of the effect of drug1 on stimulated gastric secretion ] Chronic experiments on dogs with gastric fistulas were carried out to study the influence of drug2 and drug3 on drug4 - and drug5 -induced gastric acid secretion . 
It was established that both angiotensins inhibited gastric acid secretion stimulated by drug1 but not by drug2 . 
Comparative analysis of the effects of stimulation and inhibition of cholino- and adrenoreceptors on this inhibitory action of drug1 suggested the mediation of drug2 influence through the modulation of cholinergic reactions of parietal cells in the stomach . 
[Stimulation by drug1 --an analog of the octapeptide cholecystokinin--of drug2 binding after the long-term administration of drug3 ] It has been established in experiments on white male rats that prolonged administration ( twice a day for 14 days ) of drug4 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) and drug5 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) resulted in the reduced interaction between drug6 and low affinity binding sites for drug7 in subcortical structures , whereas drug8 binding with high affinity binding sites for drug9 increased both in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures of the forebrain . 
After prolonged administration of drug1 the displacing effect of drug2 , an analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide , was replaced by the stimulant action on drug3 binding . 
It is assumed that increased interaction between drug1 and high affinity binding sites for drug2 on dopamine2- and serotonin2-receptors underlies the antipsychotic action of drug3 after their prolonged administration . 
Cholecystokinin octapeptide is a necessary factor for realization of this action of drug1 . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in rats . 
The interaction of intramuscularly injected drug1 and its N-demethylated metabolite ( metabolite I ) with drug2 was evaluated in rats . 
Five , 10 , 20 , or 50 mg/kg of drug1 alone or 20 , 50 , or 100 mg/kg of metabolite I alone produced less than 10 minutes of hypnosis . 
However , drug1 anesthetic requirement ( i.e. , MAC ) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56 % 1-2 hours and as much as 14 % 5-6 hours after injection of drug2 , 50 mg/kg , im . 
The reduction in MAC was correlated with brain levels of drug1 or metabolite I , suggesting a drug2 : metabolite I potency ration of 3:1 . 
The half-life of drug1 in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of drug2 than when drug3 was given alone . 
It is concluded that drug1 is not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with drug2 would be expected to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system . 
In vitro interaction of drug1 and drug2 in placental vessels . 
The interaction of drug1 and synthetic drug2 on placental vessels was studied in vitro . 
Resistance was measured near the placental margin after spontaneous term delivery . 
In seven experiments reactions to drug1 and drug2 were drug3 . 
drug1 produced significantly increased vasoconstriction after a single administration of drug2 . 
In eight experiments the perfusion medium contained drug1 . 
There was no change after a single dose of drug1 . 
The reaction after drug1 remained the same in both groups of experiments . 
There is thus an enhancement effect 
There is thus an enhancement effect of drug1 upon the reaction of placental vessels to drug2 in vitro . 
Note : dissolution of aerosol particles of drug1 in drug2 , a model drug3 . 
The effect of a drug1 extract from bovine lung , drug2 , on the dissolution rate of aerosol particles of drug3 was determined . 
Aerosol particles of drug1 were generated from an drug2 solution , dried , and collected by a cascade impactor for characterization or by a liquid impinger for dissolution experiments . 
Powder x-ray diffraction , differential scanning calorimetry , differential thermal analysis , and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the aerosol particles and starting material . 
No change in phase was detected , although the aerosol particles appeared to contain residual drug1 . 
The dissolution rate of the aerosol particles in saline was low and variable . 
drug1 increased the extent of dissolution of drug2 in proportion to the added concentration , which was also verified by equilibrium solubilization studies . 
drug1 also increased rate of dissolution , in a manner similar to drug2 . 
Analysis of the concentration of drug1 following ultracentrifugation indicated that there is rapid equilibration of drug2 between the drug3 and aqueous phase . 
These results show that drug1 has the potential of enhancing the rate and extent of dissolution of drugs administered to the lung . 
Anaesthesia and the epileptic pateint . 
A review . 
A review is presented of some of the problems that may arise in association with anaesthesia for epileptic patients . 
There is the possibility of precipitating anticonvulsant drug toxicity . 
Numerous drug interactions are possible with some drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , which affect hepatic microsomal enzyme systems . 
There is the risk of convulsions occurring in susceptible patients following the use of the new drug1 which are capable of inducing CNS excitability . 
Interaction between drug1 and drug2 in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryos . 
In this study we investigated whether also drug1 fulfils the function as co-activator in glutamatergic activation of NMDA receptors in the neuronal apparatus of spontaneous motility in chick embryos . 
The successive application of drug1 ( 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight ( e.w. ) 
and drug1 ( 15 mg/kg e.w. ) 
The successive application of drug1 ( 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight ( e.w. ) and drug2 ( 15 mg/kg e.w. ) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of drug3 alone . 
This effect did not depend on the order of application of the drugs . 
In 13-day-old embryos , drug1 was ineffective in both doses . 
It is concluded from these results that the modulatory effect of drug1 is evidently a later developmental acquisition ( after day 15 of incubation ) in the embryogenesis of NMDA-ergic activation of spontaneous motility in chick embryos similarly as glycinergic inhibition . 
Acute effect of different drug1 on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
Diabetic patients have a 20 % higher risk of depression than the general population . 
Treatment with drug1 can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with drug2 . 
The treatment of depression in diabetic patients must take into account variations of glycemic levels at different times and a comparison of the available drug1 is important . 
In the present study we evaluated the interference of drug1 with blood glucose levels of diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
In a first experiment , male adult Wistar rats were fasted for 12 h . 
drug1 ( 5 mg/kg ) , drug2 ( 30 mg/kg ) , drug3 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) , drug4 ( 20 mg/kg ) drug5 ( 30 mg/kg ) or vehicle was administered . 
After 30 min , fasting glycemia was measured . 
An oral drug1 overload of 1 ml of a 50 % drug2 solution was given to rats and blood glucose was determined after 30 , 60 and 90 min . 
drug1 and drug2 did not change fasting or overload glycemia . 
drug1 and drug2 increased blood drug3 at different times after the glucose overload . 
drug1 neutralized the increase of glycemia induced by oral drug2 overload . 
In the second experiment , non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were fasted , and the same procedures were followed for estimation of drug1 tolerance 30 min after drug2 overload . 
Again , drug1 neutralized the increase in glycemia after drug2 overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
These data raise the question of whether drug1 is the best choice for prolonged use for diabetic individuals , because of its antihyperglycemic effects . 
drug1 would be useful in cases with potential risk of hypoglycemia . 
drug1 promotes the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the microsomal fraction of rat liver and it enhances the effects of oleate in this respect . 
drug1 ( 0.5-2 mM ) promoted the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction in a cell-free system derived from rat liver . 
By contrast , drug1 ( 1 mM ) and drug2 ( 1 mM ) had no significant effect on the translocation when added alone . 
drug1 , and to a lesser extent , drug2 , enhanced the translocating action of oleate and increased its effectiveness in transferring the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction . 
It is proposed that the phosphohydrolase becomes metabolically active when it combines with membranes and that polyamines might help to regulate this interaction . 
This could facilitate the action of fatty acids and enable cells to increase their capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis to match an increased availability of fatty acids . 
The effects of drug1 and of drug2 anesthesia on drug3 tolerance in dogs . 
In a comparison of drug1 tolerance in dogs anesthetized with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 , the dosage of drug5 needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher , as was the LD50 of drug6 , with drug7 or drug8 than with drug9 . 
Ventricular tachycardia induced by drug1 was generally converted to sinus rhythm following administration of drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 but not after administration of drug5 alone or after drug6 . 
Excretion of thioethers in urine after exposure to electrophilic chemicals . 
Electrophilic agents--a class of chemicals that includes most genotoxic compounds--can be inactivated by reaction with glutathione or other SH-bearing molecules . 
The conjugates so formed often appear in the urine as mercapturic acids or other thioether products . 
This paper critically reviews the suitability of the urinary thioether assay as a method for the detection of exposure to electrophilic agents or their precursors . 
In practice , the greatest value of the thioether assay appears to lie in its signal function . 
This is demonstrated for cigarette smokers and industrial workers involved in chemical waste incineration . 
Whenever increased thioether excretion is observed , it is likely to be due to exposure to one or more suspect compounds . 
However , when the thioether concentration ranges within the limits of the normal value , one must not conclude that there is no , or negligible , exposure . 
More specific applications of the assay of thio compounds in urine allow development of selective methods that may be useful for biological monitoring . 
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to a drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of rhabdomyolysis resulting from concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 . 
CASE SUMMARY : A 64-year-old African-American man was admitted to the hospital for worsening renal failure , elevated creatine phosphokinase , diffuse muscle pain , and severe muscle weakness . 
About three weeks prior to admission , the patient was started on drug1 for sinusitis . 
The patient had been receiving drug1 for approximately six months . 
He was treated aggressively with intravenous hydration , drug1 , and hemodialysis . 
A muscle biopsy revealed necrotizing myopathy secondary to a toxin . 
The patient continued to receive intermittent hemodialysis until his death from infectious complications that occurred three months after admission . 
There were several factors that could have increased his risk for developing rhabdomyolysis , including chronic renal failure . 
DISCUSSION : drug1 is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , the major enzyme responsible for drug2 metabolism . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and other drug2 have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis . 
Other factors may increase the risk of this drug interaction , including the administration of other medications that are associated with myopathy , underlying renal insufficiency , and administration of high doses of drug1 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 inhibit the metabolism of drug2 that are metabolized by CYP3A4 ( i.e. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) . 
This interaction may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis , particularly in patients with renal insufficiency or those who are concurrently taking medications associated with myopathy . 
Optimal designs for the individual and joint exposure general logistic regression models . 
Interest in administering compounds in combination lies both in enhancing efficacious effects and in limiting adverse effects . 
Although much statistical work has focused on developing mathematical functions to model the joint dose-response curves , relatively little work exists in regard to designing experiments for assessing joint action . 
A variety of parametric dose-response models based on either the normal or logistic probability distribution have been proposed in the literature . 
These models are typically nonlinear in the parameters , and as such , a nonlinear weighted least squares approach can be employed for the purpose of designing experiments . 
The approach is applicable across a wide variety of settings commonly associated with joint action data , including continuous and discrete responses , alternative error structures , and nonzero background response . 
Further , designs can be expressed in terms of proportionate responses associated with the individual compounds rather than dose levels , thereby providing for results that are applicable across compounds . 
As a precursor to this effort , optimal and minimal experimental designs for the case in which a single compound is administered have also been developed . 
Although the proposed methodology for deriving experimental designs can be applied to any nonlinear regression model , primary focus is given to the additive and nonadditive independent joint action ( IJA ) models for individual and combined exposures proposed by Barton , Braunberg , and Friedman ( 1 ) . 
[The GABA-ergic system and brain edema ] It has been shown in rats with experimental toxic and traumatic edemas that drug1 ( 1 mg/kg ) removes the antiedematous action of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 and reduces the action of drug6 . 
When the dose of drug1 is minimized to 0.5 mg/kg such an effect is not observed . 
Prolonged daily administration of drug1 in a dose of 1 mg/kg results in the development of brain edema . 
It is recommended that GABA-positive drugs be included into a complex of treatment measures for edema . 
New oral therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus : The drug1 or insulin sensitizers . 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing problem not only in the United States but also across the world . 
There is now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complications of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy . 
Ultimately however , up to 80 % of type 2 diabetics die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease . 
This increased incidence of atherosclerotic disease is intricately associated with insulin resistance , which is a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 2 diabetes . 
There is strong evidence that insulin resistance is involved in the development of not only hyperglycemia , but also dyslipidemia , hypertension , hypercoagulation , vasculopathy , and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . 
This cluster of metabolic abnormalities has been termed the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
The drug1 ( drug2 and drug3 ) , a new class of oral drug4 , are &quot ; insulin sensitizers&quot ; 
and exert direct effects on the mechanisms of insulin resistance . 
These effects not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduced insulin requirements , but also have potentially favorable effects on other components of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
Long-term studies are needed to determine whether the insulin-sensitizing effects of the drug1 can prevent or delay premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , morbidity , and death . 
Effect of drug1 on the apparent volume of distribution and elimination of drug2 . 
According to Gibaldi et al . 
( 1968 , 1970 ) , the higher serum concentrations of drug1 and drug2 reached after administration of drug3 are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body . 
To determine whether drug1 has a direct effect on the distribution of drug2 , the elimination and distribution of drug3 was studied in six patients , five lacking kidney function and one with a partially impaired renal function , in the presence or absence of drug4 . 
No significant difference was found between the mean values of the volume of distribution of drug1 with and without drug2 ( 13.0 and 12.6 liters , respectively ) . 
Thus , the hypothesis of Gibaldi et al . 
could not be confirmed for drug1 in patients lacking kidney function . 
In spite of the absence of kidney function , the value of the elimination rate constant was significantly decreased in the presence of drug1 ( from 0.326 to 0.263/h ) . 
This might be explained by a blockade by drug1 of the elimination of drug2 by the liver . 
Stereoselective behavioral effects of drug1 in pigeons and squirrel monkeys . 
The behavioral effects of the stereoisomers of drug1 ( drug2 ) were compared with those of drug3 ( drug4 ) in pigeons and squirrel monkeys responding under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio ( FI FR ) schedule of food presentation . 
Intermediate doses of drug1 or drug2 produced transient increases in FI responding in monkeys and sustained increases in FI responding in pigeons ; 
higher doses decreased FI and FR responding in both species . 
In contrast to its enantiomer , drug1 failed to increase FI responding significantly in either species ; 
at high doses , drug1 decreased FI and FR responding . 
In monkeys , drug1 was about 10 times more potent than drug2 in decreasing responding , whereas in pigeons drug3 was about equipotent with drug4 . 
In both species , drug1 , but not drug2 , antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of drug3 on FI and FR responding . 
In monkeys , the effects of drug1 , but not drug2 or drug3 , were antagonized by drug4 ; 
the doses of drug1 required to antagonize the effects of drug2 were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of drug3 . 
In pigeons , drug1 did not systematically alter the effects of drug2 , drug3 or drug4 . 
drug1 reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either drug2 or drug3 in pigeons , but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of drug4 . 
The results demonstrate a high degree of stereoselectivity in the behavioral effects of drug1 . 
The levorotatory isomer had opioid-antagonist and non-opioid agonist effects in pigeons and mixed opioid agonist-antagonist effects in monkeys . 
The dextrorotatory isomer , on the other hand , had effects similar to those of drug1 in both species . 
Cancer in the elderly : basic science and clinical aspects . 
The incidence of cancer increases progressively with age . 
Rearrangements of genomes have been found to accompany cellular aging . 
These factors , in concert with age-dependent alterations in immune function and host defense , may help to explain the increased risk of malignant disease in aged persons . 
The clinical presentation and natural history of neoplasia are also affected by aging . 
This conference reviews recent developments in these areas , examines the effects of drug use in the elderly and implications for management , and discusses current information on how age may influence the response of cancer to therapy . 
Prescribing . 
Keys to maximizing benefit while avoiding adverse drug effects . 
When prescribing for older patients , some physicians are overly cautious , and this strategy can result in a less than optimal treatment outcome . 
The reluctance to treat aggressively is understandable because the geriatric population is susceptible to adverse drug reactions . 
The key to maximizing therapy lies in individualizing it as much as possible . 
There are a number of steps physicians can take to ensure that their patients are not being undertreated . 
These steps include regular reevaluations of dosages and plasma drug concentrations , recognition and understanding of drug side effects , and avoidance of certain agents . 
Close monitoring allows physicians to minimize risks , maximize benefits , and get the most out of what modern medications can do to help older patients . 
Determinants of cellular sensitivity to drug1 . 
It is now clear that topoisomerase activity level is an important determinant of sensitivity to topo drugs . 
The regulation of topoisomerases is no doubt complex and multifaceted and is probably accomplished through redundancy at many control levels . 
The mechanism ( s ) of altered topo I expression in certain tumor types is unknown , but may be related to the central importance of topoisomerases in proliferating cell functions ( transcription , replication , etc. ) , and the aberrant and chronic activation of these functions as a result of specific tumorigenic alterations . 
Small differences in sensitivity to chemotherapy can have a dramatic effect on cure rates , and therefore subtle cell type-specific differences may be important determinants of drug sensitivity . 
Whether abnormal topoisomerase quantity and specific activity are associated with resistance or sensitivity to topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy in the clinic is now being studied . 
Determinants downstream of cleavable complex formation that affect the sensitivity of tumor versus normal cells to topo drugs in particular and DNA-damaging agents in general are little known . 
The goal of enhancing selective tumor cell killing relative to the normal cells that are dose limiting may be achieved either by overcoming tumor cell resistance or by protecting normal cells . 
Both of these strategies will become more feasible as specific molecular differences between tumor and normal cells are being rapidly identified and new combination therapies that take advantage of these differences are being designed and tested . 
Interactions of drug1 and drug2 in absorption and retention . 
The effects of supplementary oral drug1 and drug2 , as well as the interaction between both at the absorption site , fecal and urinary excretion as well as the retention of these trace elements were determined by using four diets containing either 9 or 63 micrograms/kg of drug3 and 48 or 446 mg/kg of drug4 over a period of 19 days in a total of 24 rats . 
Retention was calculated by the balance technique and by the comparative slaughter technique . 
After one day , fecal as well as urinary excretion of both elements had already responded to the dietary treatments , with constant values being reached after approximately three days . 
drug1 excretion was enhanced by supplementary drug2 ; 
fecal excretion , too , was increased by supplementary drug1 ; 
whereas urinary excretion was decreased in both cases . 
Additional drug1 significantly inhibited the absorption of drug2 in both dietary drug3 treatments . 
The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg drug1 instead of 48 mg of drug2 per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of drug3 . 
Consequently , the effect of drug1 on the retention of drug2 was lower than on absorption . 
This suggests that interactions between the two elements only take place at the site of absorption . 
Because of the low dietary drug1 concentration as compared to the drug2 contents of the diets , no effect of drug3 on drug4 absorption and excretion occurred . 
Differences in drug1 balance were only observed between both dietary concentrations , showing a higher absolute but a lower relative absorption as well as retention in the groups fed further drug2 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
[Importance of pharmacogenetics ] Pharmacogenetics deals with the differences in effect of drugs caused by genetic variation . 
Differences can occur in therapeutic effect and in adverse events . 
Genetic variation in metabolism may result in high concentrations of drugs and an increased risk of adverse effects in slow metabolizers , which is important when using for example drug1 or chemotherapy . 
Genetic variation also occurs in proteins interacting with drugs , which may change the effect of e.g. 
asthma drugs and drug1 . 
The selection of drugs and their dosages may be improved , and the number of adverse effects reduced by pharmacogenetic investigations . 
However , it may be important also in case of medical examinations for insurances and job appointments , since some patients may turn out to need expensive drugs or to be susceptible to a certain disease . 
Therefore , the use of genetic data in these instances has to be regulated . 
drug1 overdose recognized by a drug2 assay . 
Altered mental status in an adolescent presents a diagnostic challenge , and the clinician depends on clinical evaluation and laboratory studies to determine therapy and prognosis . 
We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by drug1 overdose with a positive drug2 level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of drug3 with a toxicology screen for drug4 . 
drug1 . 
Treatment plans for patients taking drug1 can become complicated . 
drug1 predispose a patient to bleeding problems . 
Many drugs used in dentistry cannot be taken concomitantly with these medications . 
Acute drug1 administration does not affect subjective responses to drug2 in humans . 
RATIONALE : Stress and drug1 facilitate and reinstate psychostimulant self-administration in rodents . 
However , the effects of stress and drug1 on the subjective and behavioral effects of drug2 have not been well studied in humans . 
OBJECTIVES : To examine the effects of acute drug1 pretreatment on the subjective and behavioral effects of drug2 . 
METHODS : drug1 ( 100 mg ) and drug2 ( 20 mg ) were administered orally to 16 healthy male and female volunteers in a four-session , placebo-controlled , within-subject , crossover design . 
To prevent stomach irritation , subjects received drug1 before each experimental session . 
Dependent measures included self-reported mood and subjective effects ( Addiction Research Center inventory , the profile of mood states , and a series of visual analogue scales ) , vital signs , salivary cortisol , and psychomotor performance . 
RESULTS : drug1 elevated salivary cortisol levels , produced modest dysphoria , and reduced subjects ' reports of wanting more drug . 
However , drug1 pretreatment did not affect any of the physiological , behavioral , or subjective effects of drug2 . 
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the effects of drug1 in rodent studies , these results indicate that an acute increase in cortisol does not enhance the psychostimulant effects of drug2 in humans . 
Effect of drug1 on drug2 -induced changes in steroid hormone levels and lethality in male rats . 
We examined the effect of exogenous drug1 on the changes in serum steroid hormone levels induced by a nonlethal dose of Escherichia coli drug2 in male rats and the deaths due to nonlethal and lethal doses of drug3 . 
Injection of drug1 5 min before a nonlethal dose of drug2 changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to drug3 . 
The serum estrogen concentrations of drug1 + drug2 -treated rats decreased by 50 % , while those of the drug3 -treated rats increased ( 2- to 5-fold ) . 
The serum androgen concentrations of drug1 + drug2 -treated rats did not change significantly , while those of drug3 -treated rats dropped to 30-40 % 
0.001 . 
Exogenous drug1 also appeared to influence the percentage of drug2 -induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner . 
It reduced the number of deaths induced by nonlethal ( 2 mg/kg ) dose of drug1 but increased the number of deaths induced by a highly lethal dose ( 8 mg/kg ) . 
These results , together with the known relationships between drug1 and the immune response , suggest that drug2 affect the course of septic shock in a complex fashion and may have either protective or deleterious effect . 
Studies on the mechanism of action of drug1 : effect of drug2 on respiration and cell permeability of Candida albicans . 
The drug1 , drug2 , inhibits the growth of several species of Candida . 
Candida albicans , one of the pathogenic species , was totally inhibited at a concentration of approximately 10 mug/ml . 
Endogenous respiration was unaffected by the drug at a concentration as high as 100 mug/ml , whereas exogenous respiration was markedly sensitive and inhibited to an extent of 85 % . 
The permeability of the cell membrane was changed as evidenced by the leakage of 260-nm absorbing materials , amino acids , proteins , and inorganic cations . 
The results we present clearly show that the drug alters the cellular permeability , and thus the exogenous respiration becomes sensitive to the drug . 
Interferon induction : tool for establishing interactions among homopolyribonucleotides . 
Hitherto unrecognized interactions between homopolyribonucleotides and complexes thereof are suggested by interferon induction data obtained in a highly sensitive assay system of primary rabbit kidney cell cultures superinduced by metabolic inhibitors . 
drug1 : a therapeutic update . 
BACKGROUND : Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998 , drug1 has been used by millions of men for the treatment of erectile dysfunction . 
Recent studies and consensus reports have expanded our understanding of its efficacy , safety , contraindications , and drug interactions . 
OBJECTIVE : This paper reviews recent studies of the efficacy of drug1 , its adverse effects and drug interactions , and socioeconomic factors involved in its use , with a focus on specific patient populations ( prostate cancer , diabetes mellitus , ischemic heart disease , spinal cord injuries , neurologic disorders ) . 
METHODS : Clinical studies , case reports , and commentaries and editorials concerning drug1 published in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE , PREMEDLINE , and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts , using the terms drug2 , drug3 , and erectile dysfunction . 
RESULTS : drug1 has demonstrated effectiveness in men with erectile dysfunction associated with prostatectomy , radiation therapy , diabetes mellitus , certain neurologic disorders , and drug therapy ( eg , drug2 [ drug3 ] ) . 
It has not been as effective in women with sexual dysfunction , with the exception of drug1 -associated sexual dysfunction . 
Some disorders unrelated to sexual dysfunction ( eg , esophageal motility dysfunction ) may also respond to drug1 . 
In the general population , drug1 is considered to have an acceptable tolerability profile ; 
however , patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking drug1 therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with drug2 therapy . 
In addition , patients taking drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme , which metabolizes drug1 , may experience increased drug concentrations and possible toxicity from normal doses of drug2 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 is an effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in men . 
The decision to prescribe this agent should include such considerations as the cost-risk-benefit balance , patient access , drug distribution pathways , and prescription drug coverage . 
Tumor phenotype and susceptibility to progression as an expression of subpopulations of initiated murine cells . 
Currently , it is conceived that a number of events , or hits , are required for the induction of tumors by chemical agents . 
The first phase of this sequence , initiation , is considered to result from at least one event in the genetic apparatus . 
Analyses of this sequence , however , usually give little consideration to the nature of the target cell or to the characteristics of the resultant tumors . 
Vesselinovitch et al . 
( Cancer Res. , 38 : 2003-2010 , 1978 ) have reported that a single , small pulse of carcinogen can induce early and numerous liver tumors when administered neonatally to mice with a genetic predisposition to hepatotumorigenesis . 
In the current study , the nonpredisposed strain C57BL/6N was also shown to be highly susceptible to diethylnitrosamine during the neonatal period . 
C57BL/6N demonstrated large numbers of two of the three types of liver tumors seen in livers of genetically predisposed mice , one of which required the additional stimulus of dietary drug1 for growth . 
Tumors of more malignant phenotype were demonstrated only in genetically predisposed mice ( C57BL/6N X C3H/HeN F1 ) that received one dose of carcinogen . 
These findings suggest that the phenotype of a tumor that results from a pulse of a chemical carcinogen may depend upon the target cell . 
The initiated cells that result from this hit may vary from those that demonstrate very little progression in cell type and may or may not require exogenous enhancement of growth to those that can progress very rapidly to fully malignant behavior . 
The latter might arise from a hit in a genetically initiated cell , the result of which is a more rapid progression in tumor type . 
Effects of drug1 upon the metabolism of chylomicron-like emulsions in patients with coronary artery disease . 
Slow chylomicron intravascular catabolism has been associated with coronary artery disease and screening for drugs that can speed-up this process can be important . 
In this study , the effects of drug1 upon chylomicron metabolism was tested by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 12 patients with coronary artery disease , aged 59+/-11 years , ( total cholesterol : 240+/-41 mg/dl ; triglycerides : 188+/-42 mg/dl ) submitted to a randomized , crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled study with administration of 1 g per day drug2 or placebo for 1-month . 
A 1-month washout period was inserted between the treatment periods . 
Patients were intravenously injected a chylomicron-like emulsion doubly labeled with 14C-cholesteryl oleate and 3H-triolein at baseline and after treatments . 
After drug1 treatment , there was decrease of total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels and a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma levels . 
drug1 elicited 62 % enhancement of post- drug2 lipolytic activity and 100 % increase of 3H-triglyceride fractional clearance rate compared with placebo treatment . 
14C-cholesterol ester fractional clearance rate was 260 % greater after drug1 than after placebo . 
Therefore , a potent effect of drug1 on both chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal was achieved , indicating that this drug can be used to improve this metabolism in future prospective studies . 
Selective survival in drug1 and drug2 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O11 from drug addicts . 
The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , particularly serotype O11 , in drug1 and drug2 
was evaluated as a possible explanation for the association of deep-seated infection with this organism and abuse of these drugs . 
The mean reduction of growth caused by the drugs was 1,000-fold greater for 49 Pseudomonas strains from normal subjects than for 32 strains from drug addicts ( 4.2 vs. 1.3 logs of reduction at 2 hr , P less than .0005 ) . 
A common phenotypic subset of the serotype O11 strains from drug addicts was especially resistant to the inhibitory effects . 
Twelve strains of Staphylococcus aureus ( a frequent cause of infection in drug1 , but not in drug2 and drug3 , addicts ) were completely inhibited by the drug combination . 
Dose-response curves ( derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders ) showed that drug1 was responsible for the inhibitory activity , which was partially antagonized by drug2 . 
We conclude that an ability of some P . 
aeruginosa serotype O11 strains , but not S . 
aureus , to survive in drug1 and drug2 may explain in part a shift from S . 
aureus to P . 
aeruginosa as common pathogens of drug addicts in areas where abuse of this combination of drugs has increased . 
Influence of coadministration of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetics and QTc intervals in healthy volunteers . 
STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular safety of drug2 at steady state in healthy men . 
DESIGN : Open-label , three-phase , sequential study . 
SETTING : Clinical research center . 
SUBJECTS : Twelve healthy male volunteers . 
INTERVENTIONS : Each subject was treated according to the following sequence : baseline ; 
phase 1 ( days 1-6 ) : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ; 
washout ( days 7-13 ) ; 
phase 2 ( days 14-44 ) : drug1 20 mg/day ; 
and phase 3 ( days 45-52 ) : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ( days 45-51 ) plus drug2 20 mg/day ( days 45-52 ) . 
MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS : Blood samples were drawn and 12-lead electrocardiograms performed at specified time points after the last morning dose of drug1 in phases 1 and 3 . 
Blood samples also were taken before morning doses on the 3rd , 4th , and 5th days of phases 1 and 3 . 
Electrocardiograms were done at baseline and on the last day of the washout period and phase 2 . 
Coadministration of drug1 significantly decreased drug2 plasma concentrations . 
There were no clinically significant changes in corrected QT intervals during administration of drug1 alone or with drug2 . 
drug1 was well tolerated when administered alone or with drug2 . 
CONCLUSION : drug1 can be administered safely to patients receiving low therapeutic dosages of drug2 . 
Activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 against Cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture . 
The in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 was investigated . 
drug1 showed moderate activity , which increased with increasing concentration to 55.7 % suppression of growth at 20 microM . 
Moreover , its activity was enhanced when it was combined with either drug1 or drug2 with 90 % parasite reduction at the highest concentration tested . 
drug1 may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either drug2 or drug3 . 
Modification of surface histidine residues abolishes the cytotoxic activity of drug1 . 
drug1 displays both cytotoxic and enterotoxic activities . 
It has recently been demonstrated that drug1 exerts its cytotoxic effect by the glucosylation of the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family . 
drug1 , at pH 7.0 , was used to chemically modify exposed histidine residues on drug2 . 
Modification of drug1 with drug2 abolished both its cytotoxic activity and the ability of the toxin to bind Zn-Sepharose gel . 
Treatment of drug1 with [ ( 14 ) C ] - drug2 revealed concentration dependent labelling of histidine residues on the toxin molecules . 
The effects of drug1 could be reversed by drug2 treatment . 
These data suggest the modified histidine residues on drug1 are critical to its cytotoxic activity . 
Histidine modification had no effect on the glucosyl transferase enzyme activity of drug1 . 
However , modification abolished the ' cold ' binding of toxin to bovine thyroglobulin in an ELISA and reduced ligand binding activity in a rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination assay . 
The data suggest that the histidine residues may be crucial to the receptor-binding activity of drug1 . 
Exposed histidines on drug1 are available for drug2 chelation , and these have been exploited in the development of a novel purification protocol for drug3 using drug4 -chelating chromatography . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in vitro . 
The minimal inhibitory concentrations of drug1 and drug2 alone and in combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic , facultative , and anaerobic clinical isolates . 
All 77 strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Diplococcus pneumoniae , Streptococcus pyogenes , and anaerobic bacteria ( except for three strains of Clostridium ) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
drug1 did not interfere with the activity of drug2 within the range of concentrations tested ( 0.1 to 100 mug/ml ) ; 
for some strains combinations were synergistic . 
Sixty-two ( 94 % ) of 66 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains . 
All 20 strains of enterococcus , three strains of Clostridium , three strains of Escherichia coli , and one strain of Proteus rettgeri were resistant to both drug1 ( minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml ) and drug2 ( minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml ) . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains . 
Except for drug1 -sensitive isolates , synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo . 
Antagonism was never observed . 
drug1 and the common cold . 
Evaluation of its efficacy and toxicity . 
We reviewed the clinical data relating to the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic doses of drug1 in the prevention and treatment of the common cold . 
Although one study tentatively supports the hypothesis that such doses of drug1 may be efficacious , a second study by the same group did not confirm the significant findings , and no clear , reproducible pattern of efficacy has emerged from the review of all the evidence . 
Similarly , there is currently little adequate evidence on either the presence or the absence of serious adverse reactions to such doses of drug1 , although many such reactions have been hypothesized . 
The unrestricted use of drug1 for these purposes cannot be advocated on the basis of the evidence currently available . 
Effects of drug1 in a light/dark test in mice and the contribution of adenosine receptors . 
We investigated the effects of adenosine receptor antagonists , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ( drug5 ) , in a light/dark test in mice . 
All antagonists decreased the time spent in the light zone in this test , which suggested that these compounds have anxiogenic effects . 
The anxiogenic effects of drug1 were reduced by pretreatment with drug2 , an A2-selective agonist , but not by drug3 ( drug4 ) , an A1-selective agonist . 
However , the antagonism of the drug1 -induced anxiogenic effects by drug2 was only observed in the time spent in the light zone , and drug3 -induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by drug4 nor by drug5 . 
Finally , it is notable that xanthine-derived adenosine antagonists tested here commonly showed anxiogenic effects in the light/dark test in mice . 
It is suggested that there is a minor contribution of adenosine receptors to these effects , although drug1 -induced anxiogenic effects were antagonized by an A2 receptor agonist . 
Restoration of drug1 susceptibility in Enterococcus faecalis by antiresistance determinant gene transfer . 
We assessed the ability of gene transfer to reverse drug1 resistance in class A ( VanA ) glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecalis . 
Recombinant shuttle vectors containing a vanH promoter-vanA antisense gene cassette fully restored drug1 susceptibility through a combined transcriptional activator binding domain decoy and inducible vanA antisense RNA effect . 
Induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to drug1 and drug2 . 
1 , drug1 ( drug2 ) , the active metabolite of drug3 , is a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . 
We have shown that MCF-7 cells treated with 100 nM drug1 exhibit characteristic apoptotic morphology ( pyknotic nuclei , chromatin and cytoplasmic condensation , nuclear matrix protein reorganization ) within 48 h . 
In the experiments reported here , we examined the interactions between drug1 and the drug2 drug3 ( drug4 ) , which also induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells . 
Our data suggest that drug1 significantly potentiates the reduction in cell number induced by drug2 alone . 
Combined treatment with drug1 and drug2 enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation . 
We have selected a subclone of MCF-7 cells resistant to drug1 ( MCF-7D3Res ) . 
These cells express the vitamin D receptor and exhibit doubling times comparable to the parental MCF-7 cells , even when grown in 100 mM drug1 . 
Treatment of both parental and resistant MCF-7 cells with drug1 induces apoptosis and clusterin . 
These data emphasize that apoptosis can be induced in MCF-7 cells either by activation of drug1 -mediated signalling or disruption of drug2 -dependent signalling . 
Cholinergic role in drug1 's effects on evoked potentials in visual cortex of the albino rat . 
Photic evoked potentials were recorded from the visual cortex of chronically implanted albino rats . 
Since photic evoked potential components are representations of neural pathways which are activated during photic stimulation , study of the effects of drug1 on these components may help to trace pathways which are affected by drug2 . 
In the present study , evoked potentials were recorded at 5 , 20 , and 40 min following IP injections of saline , drug1 ( 2.0 g/kg ) , drug2 ( 0.6 mg/kg ) or drug3 ( 15.0 mg/kg ) on separate days . 
drug1 depressed the amplitudes of most evoked potential components in comparison to saline administration . 
Component P2 , however , was increased in amplitude . 
drug1 briefly reduced the amplitude of most components , including P2 . 
In contrast , drug1 increased the amplitudes of components P1 and P2 , while decreasing components N1 , N2 and N3 for varying durations of time . 
drug1 pretreatment augmented the depressant effect of drug2 on the early components P1 and N1 , while attenuating drug3 's influence on components P2 and P3 . 
Pretreatment with drug1 likewise further reduced the amplitudes of components P1 and N1 , and produced a similar effect on component N3 . 
drug1 , either alone or in combination with drug2 , produced approximately the same degree of enhancement of component P2 . 
In comparison to saline values , all three agents produced reliable increases in peak latency for most of the components , with only N3 showing no effects . 
The amplitude data from this study suggest that drug1 's augmentation of component P2 may result , at least in part , from alterations in cholinergic functions . 
Increased hepatotoxicity of drug1 by concomitant administration of drug2 in the rat . 
Since drug1 is frequently co-administered with drug2 , it is of clinical interest to study the effect of drug3 on the hepatotoxicity of drug4 . 
In male Sprague-Dawley rats fasted for 18 h , concomitant administration of drug1 ( 0.1 g/kg , i.p. ) 
as judged by increased serum enzyme activities and increased incidence of hepatic necrosis . 
Careful observations on hepatotoxicity are suggested when drug1 is prescribed with drug2 . 
Dual effect of drug1 on the drug2 -induced contraction and norepinephrine release in the guinea-pig vas deferens . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) , C129H223N3O54 , isolated from marine coelenterates of Palythoa tuberculosa , caused a first rapid contraction followed by the slow phasic contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens . 
In the presence of drug1 ( 10 ( -5 ) M ) , drug2 ( 10 ( -8 ) M ) failed to cause the first contraction ; 
however , the second contraction was potentiated . 
In the presence of drug1 ( 10 ( -6 ) M ) , the second contraction was inhibited selectively . 
When drug1 was applied to the muscle in the presence of drug2 , both first and second contractile responses to drug3 were abolished . 
When the muscle was exposed to the potassium-depleted solution , the first contractile response to drug1 was rather potentiated . 
drug1 caused the release of norepinephrine from the muscle . 
Exposure of the muscle to drug1 ( 10 ( -5 ) M ) markedly increased the drug2 -induced release . 
It is indicated that the first and second contractile responses to drug1 have entirely different properties . 
The second response is due to a release of norepinephrine from nerves and was potentiated by drug1 through the increase in the norepinephrine release , whereas the first response was not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and was inhibited by drug2 . 
The mechanism of the action of drug1 was discussed in the relation with Na , K-ATPase . 
Analgesic effects of drug1 . 
The literature provides considerable evidence indicating that several , but not all drug1 , are indeed drug2 and some are drug3 as well . 
Those for which effectiveness is reported includes drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
The proposed mechanisms of analgesic action of drug1 are reviewed and discussed . 
The literature suggests that more than one mechanism of action exists for them . 
There is considerable evidence suggesting that histaminergic and serotoninergic central pathways are involved in nociception and that drug1 drugs can modulate their responses ( 1 ) . 
The evidence for a role for norepinephrine and dopamine and the effects of drug1 on them are less well established . 
Still other pathways have been proposed . 
A greater understanding of pain mechanisms will aid in elucidating the role of drug1 in analgesia . 
Effect of drug1 on voltage-dependent Ca ( 2+ ) channel subtypes in bovine chromaffin cells . 
In previous reports we have shown that drug1 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2+ ) channels in neuronal cells . 
However , these studies did not show whether drug1 -induced inhibition of Ca ( 2+ ) currents discriminates among the various Ca ( 2+ ) channel subtypes , although it is known that there are at least five different Ca ( 2+ ) channel subtypes in neuronal cells . 
In this study we investigated the effect of drug1 on high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2+ ) channel subtypes using their drug2 drug3 ( L-type ) , drug4 ( N-type ) , or drug5 ( P-type ) in bovine chromaffin cells . 
We could observe that drug1 inhibited high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2+ ) currents in a dose-dependent manner . 
The IC ( 50 ) was about 120 microgram/ml . 
drug1 had no effect on drug2 response . 
These data suggest that drug1 are negatively coupled to three types of calcium channels in bovine chromaffin cell , including an drug2 -sensitive ( N-type ) channel , an drug3 -sensitive ( P-type ) channel and drug4 / drug5 / drug6 -resistant ( presumptive Q-type ) channel . 
Thus , the selective regulation of voltage-dependent Ca ( 2+ ) subtypes by drug1 in bovine chromaffin cell could be the cellular basis of antistress effects induced by drug2 . 
A proposed mechanism for the potentiation of cAMP-mediated acid secretion by drug1 . 
Acid secretion in isolated rabbit gastric glands was monitored by the accumulation of [ ( 14 ) C ] drug1 . 
Stimulation of the glands with drug1 synergistically augmented the response to dibutyryl cAMP . 
The augmentation persisted even after drug1 was washed out and was resistant to chelated extracellular Ca ( 2+ ) and to inhibitors of either protein kinase C or calmodulin kinase II . 
drug1 at 10 microM preferentially blocked the secretory effect of drug2 and its synergism with cAMP , whereas it had no effect on histamine- or cAMP-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min . 
drug1 inhibited the drug2 -stimulated intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) concentration ( [Ca ( 2+ ) ] ( i ) ) increase due to release from the Ca ( 2+ ) store . 
Treatment of the glands with drug1 redistributed type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor ( the major subtype in the parietal cell ) from the fraction containing membranes of large size to the microsomal fraction , suggesting a dissociation of the store from the plasma membrane . 
These findings suggest that intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) release by cholinergic stimulation is critical for determining synergism with cAMP in parietal cell activation and that functional coupling between the Ca ( 2+ ) store and the receptor is maintained by actin microfilaments . 
Phenytoin intoxication induced by drug1 . 
A patient had phenytoin intoxication after administration of drug1 , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . 
The serum concentration of drug1 increased dramatically from 16.6 to 49.1 microg/mL when drug2 was coadministered , although the daily dosage of drug3 and other drug4 had not changed . 
During drug1 and fluvoxamine treatment , ataxia , a typical side effect of drug2 , was observed . 
The genotypes of drug1 and 2C19 , the enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism , were homozygous for the wild-type alleles ( drug2 * 1/ * 1 and 2C19 * 1/ * 1 ) . 
The interaction may be a result of inhibition of both drug1 and 2C19 by drug2 . 
Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the drug1 - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 is known to raise serum drug2 levels . 
This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic basis of this interaction in 10 normal subjects . 
The pharmacokinetic variables for drug1 were determined after a 1.0 mg intravenous dose of drug2 in each subject , before and after oral drug3 , 400 mg daily for 3 weeks . 
During drug1 administration , systemic clearance of drug2 was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min ( mean +/- standard deviation ) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min ( p less than 0.01 ) . 
This was due to reductions in both renal clearance ( from 105 +/- 39 to 84 +/- 15 ml/min ) ( p less than 0.05 ) and nonrenal clearance ( from 130 +/- 38 to 88 +/- 20 ml/min ) ( p less than 0.01 ) . 
drug1 half-life of elimination was prolonged from 34 +/- 13 to 40 +/- 16 hours ( p less than 0.05 ) . 
drug1 volume of distribution was not significantly changed . 
drug1 caused a three- to fivefold increase in serum reverse triiodothyronine levels , but changes in thyroid function were not quantitatively related to the changes in drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
These alterations in drug1 pharmacokinetics produced by drug2 explain the increase in serum drug3 level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically . 
Activation of an effector immediate-early gene arc by drug1 . 
As immediate-early genes ( IEGs ) are thought to play a critical role in mediating stimulus-induced neural plasticity , IEG response induced by drug1 ( drug2 ) has been characterized to define the changes in gene expression that may underlie its long-lasting behavioral effects . 
Although activation of several transcription factor IEGs has been described , little is known about effector IEGs . 
Here , we have examined whether drug1 administration affects expression of an effector IEG arc ( activity-regulated , cytoskeleton-associated ) that encodes a protein with homology to spectrin . 
Using in situ hybridization , we observed that drug1 caused a rapid and transient dose-dependent increase in arc mRNA level in the striatum and cortex that was abolished by pretreatment with the specific dopamine D1 receptor antagonist drug2 but not by an drug3 drug4 . 
drug1 induced arc mRNA in layers IV and VI of the cortex which dopamine receptor are localized to . 
These results suggest that D1 receptors are coupled to activation of arc gene , which may be involved in functional or structural alterations underlying neural plasticity triggered by drug1 . 
Differential actions of intrathecal drug1 on blocking the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 in rats . 
In the present study , it is proposed that the drug1 applied to supraspinal brain sites produced their analgesic effects by the activation of different descending pain inhibitory systems . 
The blockade of the spinal endorphinergic system by intrathecal drug1 on the production of tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 was then studied . 
Intraventricular injection of drug1 and drug2 produced an inhibition of the tail-flick response to the heat stimulus in rats . 
Intrathecal injection of drug1 at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of drug2 , and a high dose of drug3 ( 40 micrograms ) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug4 ( 16 micrograms ) . 
On the other hand , intrathecal drug1 ( 12-120 micrograms ) had only a very weak effect on the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 ( 40 micrograms ) . 
Intraventricular injection of drug1 at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular drug2 and drug3 . 
The results indicate that a spinal drug1 -sensitive endorphinergic system is involved in the production of drug2 but not drug3 -induced tail-flick inhibition , and suggest that intraventricular drug4 and drug5 elicit their pharmacological actions via the activation of different descending pain inhibitory systems ; 
descending epsilon and mu systems for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , are proposed . 
Pharmacological treatment of depression : the role of drug1 . 
Depression is reaching epidemic proportions in the western world . 
With each successive generation more people are becoming more severely depressed at a younger age . 
Drug interactions : How to identify them . 
Interactions between theraputic agents have been recognized as increasingly important causes of drug at their usual recommended dose may , under certain conditions , produce toxicity of life-endangering proportions . 
While the recognition of drug toxicity resulting from interactions is of importance to all physciains , it is especially so for the clinician responsible for the welfare of those in the aerospace environment . 
This paper attempts to provide a basis for the understanding and identifications of important drug interactions . 
Guidelines are provided to assist the clinician in his logical approach to the identification of drug interactions when serious drug toxicity is encountered in a pateint . 
Only with knowledge of the interaction can the therapeutic regimen be altered so as to provide therapeutic levels of necessary drugs while avoiding toxicity . 
Changes in urinary homocysteine following drug1 and drug2 administration to rats . 
The present work involved the administration of both drug1 and drug2 to groups of rats , followed by determination of the homocysteine excretion rate in urine . 
The results indicate that a statistically significant difference exists between the excreted levels of homocysteine in the urine of both control and drug1 -treated rats and the levels shown by rats treated with drug2 . 
The implications of these results are discussed , especially with respect to observations which indicate that homocysteine may be a precipitating factor in the development of thrombosis . 
Also included in this paper is a study which confirms the identity of the HPLC peak as being homocysteine by forming a radioactive derivative of this particular sulphydryl-containing amino acid , and then analysing the resulting mixture by TLC . 
Effect of drug1 and drug2 on the antinociceptive effect of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 in mice . 
The influence of drug1 and drug2 on antinociceptive effect of drug3 ( 10 mg/kg ) , drug4 ( 500 mg/kg ) and drug5 ( 10 mg/kg ) was investigated in a mouse model using the tail-flick and hot-plate tests . 
All drugs were injected intraperitoneally . 
drug1 were administered to mice 30 min before applying the drug2 . 
Measurement of nociception was performed within 2 h after drug1 administration . 
drug1 at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg injected with drug2 was found to decrease the antinociceptive effect of drug3 . 
Similarly , drug1 decreased the antinociceptive effect of drug2 ( only in the tail-flick test ) and drug3 . 
drug1 used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of drug2 , drug3 ( only in the tail-flick test ) and drug4 . 
[The effect of drug1 on the renal excretion of drug2 and drug3 in dogs ] The intravenous injection of drug4 in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced drug5 and drug6 excretion in chronic canine experiments . 
The higher drug1 and drug2 excretion was due to their increased renal tubular secretion . 
In dogs , drug1 unchanged the secretion of drug2 , a test agent for anionic transport . 
Possible extrarenal mechanisms of action of drug1 on drug2 and drug3 transport were also examined . 
Differential regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells by drug1 , a homodimeric disintegrin , and monomeric disintegrins drug2 and drug3 . 
The homodimeric disintegrin drug1 was compared directly to the monomeric disintegrins drug2 and drug3 for the ability to affect protein tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells . 
It was observed that drug1 had a dramatic effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of several proteins in T24 human bladder cancer cells , including robust induction of phosphorylation of proteins in the range of 120-140 kDa . 
drug1 alone had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in T24 cells , but dose-dependently inhibits the effects of drug2 when both are added simultaneously . 
Among the proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to drug1 treatment is CAS , a 130 kDa adapter protein involved in integrin signaling . 
drug1 alone was found to have no effect on CAS , but can completely block drug2 -induced phosphorylation of this protein in MDA-MB-435 cells . 
These observations strongly suggest that the homodimeric structure of drug1 functionally distinguishes it from other monomeric members of the disintegrin family . 
Toxicity of cadmium and drug1 to miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni . 
The specific objectives of this study were to elucidate metal toxicity to hatching , survival and avoidance behaviour of Schistosoma mansoni miracidia . 
The toxicity of cadmium , drug1 , and cadmium/zinc mixtures at concentrations ranging from 10000 to 10 microg/l was investigated . 
Metal mixture toxicity investigation was undertaken with equal concentrations of the metals . 
The hatching of miracidia from eggs was inhibited by concentrations of 1000-10000 microg/l of single metals . 
Metal mixtures had no effect on drug1 hatching . 
Survival of miracidia was reduced by increasing metal concentration except at concentrations of 10 microg/l for single metal toxicity where survival was increased above the control . 
Miracidia demonstrated a rapid avoidance behaviour when briefly exposed to heavy metals . 
The mechanisms of metal toxicity to miracidia are briefly discussed . 
Drug-lab interactions : implications for nutrition support . 
drug1 interference with urine ketone test . 
It is important that health care professionals be aware of the potential for medications to interfere with clinical laboratory tests . 
Medications can cause in vivo effects when the concentration or activity of the analyte is altered before the analysis and therefore the assay result is true and accurate . 
An in vitro effect occurs when the medication interferes with the assay , and the result is erroneous and cannot be interpreted . 
This report describes a recently identified case of interference of drug1 with the urine test for ketones and demonstrates the importance of a thorough medication review in evaluating abnormal laboratory tests . 
[Pharmacologic interactions in chronic treatments : corrective measures for its prevention in a basic area of rural health ] OBJECTIVES : To identify the pharmacological interactions of clinical relevance ( PICR ) in the medication authorization cards ( MAC ) of the chronically ill and to establish strategies to minimise their appearance . 
DESIGN : Cross-sectional descriptive study . 
SETTING : Rural primary care centre . 
PATIENTS : Random sample of 626 MAC out of a total of 1306 . 
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : In December 1998 , the following was gathered for every MAC with more than one drug treatment : age , sex , number of drugs , intrinsic value , drugs prescribed , daily dose and pharmacological interactions ( PI ) , classified ( using the scale of Hansten 1996 ) into light and clinically relevant . 
Statistical analysis : Mantel-Haenszel ( alpha = 0.05 ) . 
Patients ' mean age was 69.1 ( 95 % CI , +/- 1.2 ) . 
Mean number of drugs per MAC was 4 ( 95 % CI , +/- 0.2 ) . 
341 PI affecting 197 patients ( 31.5 % , 95 % CI , +/- 3.6 ) were identified . 
24.9 % ( 95 % CI , +/- 4.5 ) were PICR , detected in 11.7 % ( 95 % CI , +/- 2.5 ) of the MAC . 
The existence of PI was related to the number of drugs prescribed to each patient ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) . 
There were 26 PI with drugs of low intrinsic value ( 7.6 % ; 95 % CI , +/- 2.8 ) . 
74.1 % ( 95 % CI , +/- 9.3 ) of the total PICR could be avoided by simple recommendations ; 
and the remaining 25.9 % ( 95 % CI , +/- 9.3 ) by monitoring and follow-up of patients . 
CONCLUSIONS : It is important to identify the medications most commonly involved in the PICR so as to establish corrective measures to minimise the risks arising from multiple medication . 
Four educational messages advise on over 60 % of the PICR detected . 
Neurochemical and functional consequences following drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 . 
The neurochemical and functional consequences following drug1 administration to the rat were evaluated and compared to similar effects following drug2 administration . 
It was observed that drug1 induced long lasting depletions of striatal dopamine concentrations and this neurotoxic effect could be prevented by drug2 pretreatment . 
The drug1 -induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of drug2 and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of drug3 in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm . 
drug1 , like drug2 , produced depletions of striatal dopamine but these actions were potentiated by drug3 pretreatment . 
These observations are discussed in reference to possible deleterious effects following the administration of drug1 to patients with Parkinson 's Disease . 
Responses to drug1 of the perfused pancreas of the genetically diabetic Chinese hamster . 
Nonketotic , genetically diabetic Cinese hamsters show subnormal pancreatic insulin release and impaired suppression of glucagon in response to glucose . 
To study the pancreatic effects of other agents , dynamic insulin and glucagon release was measured from the in vitro perfused pancreases of normal and diabetic Chinese hamsters in response to various combinations of drug1 ( 20mM ) , drug2 ( 100 or 150 mg. per 100 ml. ) , and drug3 ( 10 mM ) . 
drug1 alone caused identical insulin and glucagon release in diabetics and normals . 
drug1 , alone and in the presence of drug2 , caused subnormal insulin release and less suppression of glucagon release in the diabectics than in the normals . 
drug1 , in the presence of drug2 and drug3 , caused excessive glucagon release but nearly normal insulin release in the diabetics . 
drug1 , in the absence of drug2 or drug3 , caused excessive glucagon release in the diabetics and undetectable insulin release in either diabetics or normals . 
Pancreatic content after perfusion did not correlate with release during perfusion . 
Infusion of drug1 alone markedly decreased the amount of extractable pancreatic insulin and glucagon . 
These results indicate that the pancreatic alpha cell of the diabetic Chinese hamster responds excessively to drug1 , as is seen in the human diabetic . 
This defect is not related to acute insulin release or the presence of drug1 . 
Further , these results confirm that the diabetic Chinese hamster 's alpha and beta cells respond normally to drug1 , but are relatively insensitive to drug2 . 
Interference of biocytin with drug1 -evoked hyperpolarization and membrane properties of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons . 
In our laboratory , preliminary whole-cell , tight seal recordings of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons including biocytin in the patch pipette yielded a significantly smaller proportion of neurons hyperpolarized by drug1 compared with recordings without biocytin . 
Therefore , we investigated the effects of biocytin inclusion on drug1 responses and other membrane properties during whole-cell , tight seal recordings of these neurons . 
The percentage of neurons hyperpolarized by drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 was significantly reduced when 1 % but not &lt ; 
or =0.2 % biocytin was included in the recording pipette , compared with neurons recorded without biocytin . 
However , a significantly higher proportion of neurons fired spontaneous action potentials with either 0.05-0.2 or 1 % biocytin compared to no biocytin . 
Resting membrane potential , input impedance and the proportion of neurons displaying transient outward rectification were each significantly altered for neurons recorded with 1 % but not 0.05-0.2 % biocytin . 
These effects may be due to a relatively specific blockade of diverse potassium channel types . 
Because efficient labeling can be achieved with 0.1 % biocytin with whole-cell recording , higher concentrations are contraindicated . 
drug1 : in vitro evaluation of its permeation enhancing effect on peptide drugs . 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 ( drug4 ) conjugates on the intestinal permeation of drug5 ( drug6 ) and model peptide drugs , drug7 and drug8 . 
drug1 was covalently linked to carbodiimide activated drug2 . 
Iodometric titration of the polymer conjugates was used to determine the extent of immobilised drug1 . 
Permeation studies were performed on guinea pig small intestinal mucosa mounted in Ussing-type chamber . 
Unmodified drug1 ( 1 % m/v ) significantly improved the transport ratio ( R= P ( app ) polymer/ P ( app ) control ) of drug2 to 1.3 and 1 % ( m/v ) drug3 conjugated with drug4 further enhanced the permeation . 
drug1 conjugation at 3.6 , 5.3 and 7.3 % ( m/m ) resulted in R-values of 1.4 , 1.7 and 1.8 , respectively . 
Decreasing the concentration of drug1 , exhibiting 7.3 % ( m/m ) of immobilised drug2 ( CMC-Cys7.3 ) from 1 % ( m/v ) to 0.5 % ( m/v ) decreased the R-value of drug3 from 1.8 to 1.2 . 
drug1 at 1 % ( m/v ) in the presence of free drug2 had no significant effect on the R-value of drug3 compared to drug4 alone . 
Formulation of fluorescence labelled drug1 and drug2 in unconjugated drug3 ( 1 % m/v ) did not significantly improve the permeation , however in the presence of 1 % ( m/v ) drug4 7.3 a significantly improved permeation was observed ( R= 1.3 ) . 
Conjugation at drug1 with drug2 moieties significantly improves the intestinal permeation of the hydrophilic molecule drug3 and the model peptide drugs drug4 and drug5 in vitro , therefore this conjugated system maybe useful for peroral administration of peptide drugs in the future . 
Effects of low temperatures on microtubules in the non-myelinated axons of post-ganglionic sympathetic nerves . 
The effect of temperature changes on the number of microtubules in non-myelinated axons has been studied in cat inferior mesenteric ganglion/hypogastric nerve preparations incubated at various temperatures in Eagles minimal essential tissue culture medium in vitro . 
At 37 degrees C the non-myelinated axons contained 28.4 plus or minus 0.8 S.E.M. 
( 54 ) microtubules per axon . 
After incubation at 0 degrees C for 4 h this number fell to 2.3 plus or minus 0.1 S.E.M. 
( 41 ) but returned to normal levels when the nerves were rewarmed . 
This loss of microtubules on cooling the nerves and their reappearance on rewarming was a rapid process ; 
it was independent of the influence of the nueronal cell body and of protein synthesis within the axon . 
The preservation of the microtubules was improved when D2O was present in the incubation medium . 
Reformed microtubules appeared to function normally with respect to their possible role in the transport of noradrenaline storage vesicles along the axons . 
The drug1 for urinary tract infections : a review . 
The drug1 are a rapidly growing class of drug2 with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive aerobic bacteria . 
These agents , including drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , have been extensively studied and have demonstrated efficacy and safety profiles comparable to those of other traditional agents for the treatment of complicated or uncomplicated urinary tract infections and prostatitis . 
Advantages offered by this class of drug1 include optimal pharmacokinetics , effectiveness against multidrug-resistant organisms , and oral administration even when parenteral drug2 are generally used . 
The drug1 are also extensively used in urologic surgery . 
If taken 1 hour before drug1 ( drug2 ) , drug3 does not affect drug4 exposure , despite persistent buffering effects . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 significantly reduces the level of exposure to drug3 , but it is unclear how soon after drug4 administration drug5 may be given safely . 
We compared drug1 pharmacokinetics and gastric pH in 12 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients by use of 800 mg of drug2 alone versus 800 mg of drug3 administered 1 h after drug4 administration . 
Median gastric pH was significantly higher when drug1 was taken after drug2 administration ; 
however , no significant difference in the maximum concentration in plasma or the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 h was observed . 
drug1 may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of drug2 . 
Progestin-only oral contraception : a comprehensive review .

Hypothermia as an index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction in the rat . 
Decreased core temperature in female rats was investigated as one possible index of the drug1 - drug2 reaction ( DER ) . 
Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when drug1 was administered to rats treated with drug2 8 hours before the drug3 challenge . 
The decrease in temperature began within 20 minutes after drug1 administration , reaching a maximal decrease between 60 and 120 minutes post drug2 . 
The core temperature returned to normal 300 minutes after drug1 . 
The blood pressure ( carotid cannulation ) decreased along with the core temperature . 
Maximal hypotension was found 120 minutes post drug1 , and returned to normal 300 minutes after drug2 . 
Heart rate increased initially and returned to normal 40 minutes after drug1 challenge . 
Intestinal absorption of drug1 in the chick . 
The intestinal absorption of drug1 ( drug2 ) has been investigated in the chick by means of the in situ ligated duodenal loop technique . 
By this procedure , it was observed that drug1 is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed ( 80-95 % ) from the lumen at drug2 concentrations up to 5 mM , declining to about 50 % absorption at 50 mM . 
Transfer from the intestinal lumen to the mucosal cells at low drug1 concentration ( 0.1 mM ) is rapid , while transfer from the mucosal cells to the body occurs more slowly . 
At stable drug1 concentrations greater than 1 mM , fractional mucosal cell accumulation of drug2 remains constant , while fractional transfer to the body declines . 
However , total mucosal accumulation of drug1 and that transferred to the body increase in a linear logarithmic fashion from 0.05 to 5 mm drug2 . 
The results indicate that drug1 readily penetrates both the mucosal and serosal surfaces of the epithelial membrane . 
Furthermore , drug1 and drug2 do not appear to share a common transport pathway in the duodenum and no evidence was obtained for any interaction between the two at this level . 
drug1 administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal drug2 absorption , acting primarily to enhance serosal transport . 
drug1 : an updated review of its use in the management of schizophrenia . 
drug1 , a drug2 , is a drug3 which has proven efficacy against the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . 
Compared with drug1 , it has greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A than for dopamine D2 receptors . 
In large , well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses , drug1 5 to 20 mg/day was significantly superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day in overall improvements in psychopathology rating scales and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptoms , and was comparable in effects on positive psychotic symptoms . 
The 1-year risk of relapse ( rehospitalisation ) was significantly lower with drug1 than with drug2 treatment . 
In the first double-blind comparative study ( 28-week ) of drug1 and drug2 , drug3 10 to 20 mg/day proved to be significantly more effective than drug4 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms but not on overall psychopathology symptoms . 
In contrast , preliminary results from an 8-week controlled study suggested drug1 2 to 6 mg/day was superior to drug2 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) , although consistent with the first study , both agents demonstrated similar efficacy on measures of overall psychopathology . 
Improvements in general cognitive function seen with drug1 treatment in a 1-year controlled study of patients with early-phase schizophrenia , were significantly greater than changes seen with either drug2 or drug3 . 
However , preliminary results from an 8-week trial showed comparable cognitive enhancing effects of drug1 and drug2 treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder . 
Several studies indicate that drug1 has benefits against symptoms of aggression and agitation , while other studies strongly support the effectiveness of drug2 in the treatment of depressive symptomatology . 
drug1 is associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than drug2 and drug3 . 
In addition , drug1 is not associated with a risk of agranulocytosis as seen with drug2 or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as seen with drug3 or prolongation of the QT interval . 
The most common adverse effects reported with drug1 are bodyweight gain , somnolence , dizziness , anticholinergic effects ( constipation and dry mouth ) and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations . 
In comparison with drug1 , the adverse events reported significantly more frequently with drug2 in > or = 3.5 % of patients were dry mouth , bodyweight gain and increased appetite and compared with drug3 , only bodyweight gain occurred significantly more frequently with drug4 . 
The high acquisition cost of drug1 is offset by reductions in other treatment costs ( inpatient and/or outpatient services ) of schizophrenia . 
Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that drug1 does not significantly increase , and may even decrease , the overall direct treatment costs of schizophrenia , compared with drug2 . 
Compared with drug1 , drug2 has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs , despite the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug . 
drug1 treatment improves quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses to a greater extent than drug2 , and to broadly the same extent as drug3 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 demonstrated superior antipsychotic efficacy compared with drug2 in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia , and in the treatment of some patients with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia . 
The reduced risk of adverse events and therapeutic superiority compared with drug1 and drug2 in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms support the choice of drug3 as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response . 
Antimicrobial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with some drug2 . 
Antimicrobial activity of drug1 ( the aqueous extract from the carpophores of Ganoderma lucidum ( FR ) KARST ) was tested in vitro against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria by serial broth dilution method , and the antimicrobial activity was expressed by minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) . 
Among fifteen species of bacteria tested , the antimicrobial activity of drug1 was the most potent against Micrococcus luteus ( MIC , 0.75 mg/ml ) . 
To investigate the effects of antimicrobial combinations of drug1 with four kinds of drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 ) , the fractional inhibitory concentration index ( FICI ) was determined by checkerboard assay for each strain . 
The antimicrobial combinations of drug1 with four drug2 resulted in additive effect in most instances , synergism in two instances , and antagonism in two instances . 
Synergism was observed when drug1 was combined with drug2 against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella oxytoca . 
drug1 protects mouse tumour and normal tissues from the toxicity of oral drug2 . 
Because the drug1 drug2 is given exclusively by the oral route in man , we have carried out studies in mice on the antitumour activity , acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral drug3 , either alone or in combination with the chemosensitizer drug4 . 
In both plasma and KHT tumour the peak concentration and &quot ; early&quot ; 
AUC for total drug1 were about 1.4-1.5 fold greater for the oral compared to the i.p. 
route . 
These differences were reflected in the roughly twofold greater antitumour activity for the oral route . 
In contrast , acute toxicity tests showed that oral drug1 was 1.45 times less toxic to normal tissue , although the dose-limiting organ may be different for the two routes . 
drug1 reduced the antitumour activity of oral drug2 by dose modifying factors ( DMF ) of 0.58-0.71 . 
Similarly , the acute toxicity was also diminished by a DMF of 0.74 . 
drug1 has a complex effect on oral drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
The plasma and tumour total drug1 peak concentrations were reduced by 1.5 and 1.7 fold respectively . 
drug1 also reduced the &quot ; early&quot ; 
drug1 AUC , with the extent of the reduction depending on the minimum effective concentration ( MEC ) chosen . 
For example , the plasma drug1 AUC was reduced by factors of 1.05 and 9.6 for MEC values of 1 and 2 micrograms ml-1 respectively . 
We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral drug1 cytotoxicity by drug2 . 
Clinical trials of such combinations should be accompanied by detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation . 
Pharmacokinetic interaction between single oral doses of drug1 and drug2 in healthy volunteers . 
AIM AND BACKGROUND : The pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 , a drug2 metabolized by CYP3A4 , and the drug3 drug4 was studied in 18 healthy subjects . 
Several clinically important interactions have previously been reported for other drug1 that are metabolized by the same enzyme and for drug2 . 
METHODS : Healthy subjects who were 20 to 43 years old participated in an open , three-period , randomized , crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg oral dose of drug1 , a single oral 120-mg dose of drug2 , and the two drugs given together . 
The three study periods were separated by a 21-day washout phase . 
RESULTS : The geometric mean ( 90 % confidence interval ) whole blood drug1 area under the plasma concentration time-curve increased 60 % ( 35 % -90 % ) , from 736 to 1178 ng x h/mL , and maximum concentration increased 43 % ( 14 % -81 % ) , from 67 to 96 ng/mL , with drug2 coadministration , whereas the mean elimination half-life of drug3 decreased slightly , from 79 to 67 hours . 
Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of drug1 decreased with 38 % and 45 % , respectively , when drug2 was given with drug3 . 
The plasma maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 were unchanged after coadministration of drug4 , and no potentiation of the effects of drug5 on diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameters was seen . 
CONCLUSIONS : Single-dose drug1 coadministration leads to higher drug2 exposure , presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of drug3 . 
Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the drug1 - drug2 interaction , whole blood drug3 concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs . 
drug1 , a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4- ( 3-hydroxyphenyl ) piperidine , prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous drug2 without affecting analgesia . 
drug1 is a novel drug2 that may selectively prevent drug3 -induced gastrointestinal effects without reversing analgesia . 
Gastrointestinal transit time ( lactulose hydrogen breath test ) was measured in 14 volunteers with oral and intravenous placebo , oral placebo and intravenous drug1 ( 0.05 mg x kg ( -1 ) ) , and oral drug2 ( 4 mg ) and intravenous drug3 ( 0.05 mg x kg ( -1 ) ) in a double blind , cross-over study . 
drug1 prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes ( P = .005 ) ; 
drug1 prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes ( P = .005 ) ; this was prevented by drug2 ( P = .004 ) . 
Postoperatively , 45 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive drug1 ( 4 mg ) or placebo and intravenous drug2 ( 0.15 mg/kg ) or to receive oral and intravenous placebo . 
Analgesia and pupil constriction were measured . 
drug1 analgesia and pupil constriction were unaffected by drug2 and differed from placebo ( P &lt ; .002 ) . 
We conclude that drug1 prevents drug2 -induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia . 
The effects of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 on bar-press behavior in normal and genetically nervous dogs . 
Studies on two strains of pointer dogs have demonstrated that administration of a drug1 ( drug2 ) facilitates acquisition of goal-directed behavior in &quot ; genetically nervous&quot ; 
subjects . 
Continued admistration of the drug is required to maintain barpress response in this strain of dogs . 
The concomitant administration of either drug1 or drug2 , compounds which inhibit neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine , disrupts the behavioral response of the genetically nervous E-strain subjects to a far greater extent than the stable A-strain subjects . 
It is also shown that after 14 days of daily administration of drug1 , withdrawal of the drug not only re-results in almost complete loss of bar-press response in the E-strain subjects but also results in a temporary decrease in the acquired behavioral response of the stable A-strain subjects . 
Therapeutic drug monitoring can avoid iatrogenic alterations caused by drug1 ( MDP ) - drug2 interaction . 
drug1 is an drug2 used to treat a wide variety of infections caused by gram-negative organisms , but it is potentially toxic to the kidneys . 
Due to its nephrotoxicity , drug1 may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on drug2 bone scintigraphy . 
The presence of the drug1 in the kidneys , along with an increase in renal retention , tend to produce scintigraphic results that falsely identify characteristics related to diseases such as renal vascular , or urinary tract obstruction , and even renal cancer . 
An altered biodistribution may provide misleading information that can either mask or mimic certain disease symptoms . 
A method to maximize the therapeutic benefit of drug1 while minimizing the risk of nephrotoxicity and the appearance of a hot kidney on scintigraphy is desirable . 
Serial pharmacokinetic dosing has been proposed as a method to accomplish this goal . 
Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) of drug1 therapy , and bone scintigraphy employing drug2 as the drug3 was carried out in 22 patients . 
The data presented here demonstrate that with serial pharmacokinetic dosing of drug1 , the iatrogenic alteration caused by drug2 therapy can be avoided . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in anaesthetised horses . 
Evoked hind limb digital extensor tension ( hoof twitch ) was maintained at 40 % of baseline for 1 h by drug1 infusion in 7 horses anaesthetised with drug2 . 
After 1 h , drug1 was discontinued and hoof twitch allowed to recover to 75 % . 
drug1 was again given by infusion to maintain 40 % twitch for a second hour , then 2 mg drug2 /kg bwt were given i.v. 
drug1 infusion was continued for a third hour , and then hoof twitch was again allowed to recover spontaneously to 75 % . 
drug1 reduced twitch strength from 40 +/- 1 % ( mean +/- sem ) to 29 +/- 4 % within 7.0 +/- 1.5 min ( P = 0.02 ) . 
Twitch gradually returned to pre- drug1 strength over the course of the next hour . 
Recovery of hoof twitch from 50 % to 75 % took 7.7 +/- 0.7 min for drug1 alone and 11.5 +/- 2.7 min for drug2 plus drug3 ( P = 0.03 ) . 
Recovery from 50 % twitch to 75 % fade recovery took 13.8 +/- 0.8 min for drug1 alone and 13.7 +/- 1.2 min for drug2 plus drug3 . 
At 75 % recovery of fade , hoof twitch was 87 +/- 3 % for drug1 alone and 82 +/- 4 % for drug2 plus drug3 . 
Reversal of the block with drug1 and subsequent recovery of the horses from anaesthesia were uneventful . 
It was concluded that , although drug1 did augment the neuromuscular blockade of drug2 , the effect was minimal . 
Diagnostic , treatment and aftercare approaches to drug1 abuse . 
The general public feels that drug1 is not particularly dangerous because it does not produce a well defined physical dependency and abstinence syndrome . 
However , when addiction is defined as compulsion , loss of control and continued use in spite of adverse consequences , drug1 drug hunger can be seen as an agent of addictive disease . 
Withdrawal from drug1 dependence usually involves depression , anxiety and lethargy . 
These usually clear within a week , leaving only the &quot ; drug hunger&quot ; 
to contend with . 
Medication is rarely needed . 
When drug1 is the primary addiction , after withdrawal the most effective treatment is group therapy with other recovering cocaine abusers . 
We incorporate the principles of recovery and define positive and constructive alternatives in dealing with cocaine hunger . 
Recovery programs should be flexible and involve individual and family education on recovery and the nature of addictive disease . 
Exercise that produces cardiopulmonary stimulation is a helpful means of reducing drug hunger and anxiety during recovery therapy . 
Systemic drug1 . 
Understanding the breadth of systemic drug1 available for use by the dermatologist and their associated side-effect profiles and drug interactions allows the clinician to offer patients optimal care in the management of cutaneous infectious disease . 
Altered responsiveness to drug1 after exposure to organic lead . 
drug1 is known to effect the functional integrity of the limbic system , particularly the hippocampus , and to alter behaviors which are thought to be mediated through limbic function . 
Organometals also compromise the limbic system and result in deficits in learning and memory . 
Since both drug1 and organoleads are present in the environment and seem to influence limbic integration , the interaction of these two compounds was assessed in the present experiment . 
Thirty male rats of the Fischer-344 strain were divided into three equal groups and were given injections of drug1 ( drug2 ) ( 8.0 or 17.0 mg/kg/ml SC ) or the saline vehicle . 
Fourteen days later , all animals were challenged with a single hypnotic dose of drug1 ( 3.5 g/kg IP ) . 
The 20 % v/v solution of drug1 was prepared in water from a stock solution of 95 % drug2 . 
The latency to loss of the righting reflex and duration of sleep time were recorded while the rats were kept in sound-attenuating chambers . 
The rats treated with the highest dose of drug1 manifested significantly longer latencies to lose the righting reflex and shorter durations of sleep than did controls . 
These results suggest that exposure to environmental drug1 may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to drug2 . 
Evidence for reduction of drug1 uptake sites in the failing human heart . 
OBJECTIVES . 
This study investigated the role of neuronal uptake of drug1 ( uptake-1 ) in human heart failure as a local factor for altering concentrations of norepinephrine at the cardiac myocyte membranes . 
BACKGROUND . 
Several beta-adrenergic neuroeffector defects occur in heart failure . 
Whether an alteration in drug1 uptake-1 occurs is still unresolved . 
METHODS . 
The role of drug1 uptake-1 was studied in electrically stimulated ( 1 Hz , 37 degrees C ) human ventricular cardiac preparations and isolated myocardial membranes . 
RESULTS . 
The effectiveness of drug1 in increasing the force of contraction was decreased in relation to the degree of heart failure . 
In contrast , the potency of drug1 was increased in failing hearts ( New York Heart Association functional class IV ) in relation to the concentrations producing 50 % of the maximal effect ( EC50 ) . 
The EC50 values for drug1 , which is not a substrate for drug2 uptake-1 , were reduced in myocardium in functional classes II to III and IV compared with those in nonfailing myocardium . 
The uptake inhibitors drug1 and drug2 ( 3 mumol/liter ) potentiated the positive inotropic effects of drug3 in nonfailing myocardium ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) but not in functional class IV myocardium . 
Radioligand binding experiments using the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-3 drug1 revealed a significant decrease by approximately 30 % in drug2 uptake-1 carrier density in functional classes II to III and IV myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS . 
In human heart failure , there is a presynaptic defect in the sympathetic nervous system , leading to reduced uptake-1 activity . 
This defect in the failing heart can be mimicked by the effects of uptake blocking agents , such as drug1 and drug2 , in the nonfailing heart only . 
Compromised drug1 uptake-1 in functional class IV cannot be further increased by drug2 and drug3 . 
The pathophysiologic consequences could be an increased synaptic concentration of drug1 predisposing to adenylyl cyclase desensitization . 
The mechanism of drug1 -induced vasorelaxation differs in the mesenteric resistance arteries of lean and obese rats . 
drug1 has been shown to induce vasorelaxation . 
In this study , we investigated the mechanism ( s ) of drug1 -induced vasorelaxation in resistance mesenteric arteries from male lean and dietary-induced obese rats . 
Compared with lean rats , arteries from dietary-obese rats showed significant ( P&lt ; 0.001 ) endothelial dysfunction , as indicated by a decrease ( >20 % ) in maximal acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation . 
drug1 ( 5-35 micromol/l ) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric arteries preconstricted with drug2 ( 8 micromol/l ) or drug3 ( 125 mmol/l ) from both lean and dietary-obese rats . 
There were no significant differences between the two groups , achieving a maximum relaxation of >95 % at a concentration of 35 micromol/l . 
However , drug1 ( 100 and 300 micromol/l ) did not alter the effects of drug2 on arteries from dietary-obese rats , giving superimposed concentration-responses curves . 
drug1 was also ineffective in altering drug2 activity in arteries from both lean and dietary-obese rats . 
In drug1 -precontracted arteries from dietary-obese rats , responses to drug2 were not attenuated by endothelial denudation , indicating an action independent of the endothelium . 
This study indicates that : ( a ) the maximal effects of drug1 on resistance arteries from lean and dietary-obese rats are not effected by endothelial dysfunction , and ( b ) the effects of drug2 in lean animals ( where endothelial function is not impaired ) , but not in dietary-obese rats , are mediated via NO . 
drug1 : an IgA-binding lectin . 
We previously reported that seeds of Artocarpus integrifolia ( jackfruit ) contain a lectin , which we call drug1 , that is both a potent T cell mitogen and an apparently T cell-independent activator of human B cells for the secretion of immunoglobulins . 
During the above experiments we noted a massive precipitation in cell cultures stimulated with greater than or equal to 100 micrograms of lectin . 
In this paper , we show that the precipitate is formed after the interaction of drug1 and the serum protein added to the culture medium . 
More importantly , we demonstrate that IgA is probably the major serum constituent precipitated by the lectin and that no IgG or IgM can be detected in the precipitates . 
In secretions such as colostrum , IgA is the only protein precipitated by drug1 . 
On the basis of this specificity we describe a simple and reliable affinity chromatography procedure for the purification of both human serum and colostrum IgA . 
drug1 is a D-Gal binding lectin and should be a useful tool for studying of serum and secretory IgA . 
[2 epidemics of arsenical encephalopathy in the treatment of trypanosomiasis , Uganda , 1992-1993 ] Since 1988 , the french non-governmental organisation M decins Sans Fronti res is running a control program of human african trypanosomiasis in the district of Moyo , North-Uganda . 
Between 1988 and 1993 , more than 7,000 patients were diagnosed and treated . 
Since 1988 , it has been noted that incidence of drug1 reaction had increased systematically between June and October of each year , indicating strong seasonal variation . 
In 1992 and 1993 , two outbreaks of arsenical reactive encephalopathy ( ARE ) occurred in the sleeping sickness center of Adjumani . 
The incidence of ARE suddenly exceeded 10 % of the patients treated by drug1 during August 1992 and September 1993 . 
The onset of 80 % of those &quot ; epidemic&quot ; 
cases , occurred between the 5th and the 11th day of treatment . 
Two retrospective studies were conducted in 1992 ( 75 cases ) and in 1993 ( 51 cases ) . 
Among the risk factors studied , two appear to increase the risk of ARE : the prescription of drug1 to treat strongyloidiasis during the drug2 cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients . 
These observations suggest that exogenous co-factors could be involved in the occurrence of ARE . 
Recommendations were to avoid administration of diffusible drug1 treatment during the cure , and to improve the general conditions of patients before the cure of drug2 . 
Behavioral responses to repeated drug1 exposure in mice selectively bred for differential sensitivity to drug2 . 
Mice from the 20th generation of three lines divergently selected for response to drug1 -induced sedation times [long-sedation time ( LST ) , short sedation time ( SST ) , and randomly bred control ( RBC ) ] were used to study drug2 -induced behavioral sensitization . 
These lines showed variable degrees of locomotor activities in response to drug1 . 
At a low drug1 dose and long withdrawal period ( 10 mg/kg , twice a day for 5 days followed by a 14-day withdrawal ) , the LST mice showed tolerance development . 
In response to drug1 , the locomotor activities of the SST were not significantly different from the RBC group . 
At a higher dose and a shorter withdrawal period ( 20 mg/kg , daily for 7 days followed by a 3-day withdrawal ) , the SST mice showed behavioral sensitization similar to the RBC mice , but the LST mice did not develop sensitization . 
The different responses in locomotor activity induced by drug1 suggest that genetic factors may play a role in determining the magnitude of response to this drug . 
Dopamine ( DA ) levels did not differ significantly in either striatum ( STR ) or nucleus accumbens ( NAC ) for the drug1 -treated animals to their corresponding saline-treated controls . 
The affinity ( Kd ) of D2 in the NAC decreased significantly , without changes in density ( Bmax ) , in the drug1 -treated SST and RBC mice . 
On the other hand , the density of D2 binding sites in the SST and the RBC mice in the STR was significantly increased in drug1 -treated groups without change in Kd . 
The LST mice did not show any changes in the Kd and Bmax in either the STR or the NAC . 
Taken together , these findings suggest that the changes in the Kd of D2 in the NAC and the Bmax of D2 in the STR may contribute to the differences in locomotor responses to drug1 exposure in these mouse lines . 
drug1 inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of drug2 . 
OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to examine the interaction between drug1 and drug2 to confirm that drug3 inhibits CYP2C9 . 
METHODS : The study was carried out as an open , randomized , crossover design with 14 healthy participants . 
In period A , all volunteers took 500 mg of drug1 orally . 
In period B , the volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups . 
Each group took either 150 mg or 75 mg of drug1 a day for 5 days ( day -3 to day 2 ) . 
The groups then took 500 mg of drug1 as a single dose ( day 0 ) . 
In both periods , blood and urine were sampled at regular intervals . 
Plasma was analyzed for drug1 , and urine was analyzed for drug2 and its two metabolites , drug3 and drug4 by means of HPLC . 
RESULTS : During treatment with drug1 , there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of drug2 , from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h , among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d . 
There was a reduction that reached borderline statistical significance in the group that received 150 mg/d of drug1 . 
The clearance by means of drug1 and drug2 was significantly reduced in both groups ( ie , from 901 mL/h to 318 mL/h in the group that received 150 mg of drug3 per day and from 723 mL/h to 457 mL/h in the group that received 75 mg of drug4 per day ) . 
Thus there was a tendency toward a more pronounced inhibition of the 4-hydroxylation during treatment with 150 mg/d of drug1 compared with 75 mg/d , but the difference was not statistically significant . 
CONCLUSION : drug1 is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vivo . 
Influence of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism . 
Available data indicate that platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism are important factors in hemostasis and regulation of vascular tone . 
Plasma membrane and intracellular mobilization of calcium ions are intimately related to platelet activation and release of platelet contents . 
Release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids as well as subsequent synthesis and release of vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 are also regulated by movement of calcium ions . 
Adenosine 3 ' : 5'-cyclic phosphate in turn controls levels of free calcium ions in platelets and regulates calcium-dependent reactions . 
drug1 , such as drug2 , drug3 and drug4 , inhibit platelet activation in vitro , and decrease platelet adhesion intravascularly . 
These agents have also been shown to decrease platelet nucleotide release and thromboxane A2 generation . 
Some preliminary data suggest that drug1 also increase generation of vasodilator and platelet antiaggregant prostacyclin , which could contribute to decrease in platelet function . 
These effects of drug1 on platelet function and arachidonic acid metabolism could contribute in part to their efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease . 
Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular drugs in patients with chronic renal disease . 
Cardiovascular disease is a common comorbidity and a major cause of mortality in patients with chronic renal disease . 
Drug regimens in patients with cardiovascular disease are frequently complex and can be significantly affected by alterations in renal function . 
In addition , several cardiovascular drugs directly affect renal function and the management of patients with renal disease . 
This article reviews the impact of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of cardiovascular drugs and identifies clinically important interactions between these and other drugs commonly used in the management of chronic renal disease . 
Several classes of cardiovascular drugs are also discussed in relationship to their differential effects on the management and progression of renal disease . 
Influence of drug1 and drug2 on the sensitivity of rat thoracic aorta to drug3 . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low and high doses of drug1 , and of drug2 on the response to drug3 in rat thoracic aorta . 
Two weeks after bilateral ovariectomy , female rats received a s.c. 
injection of vehicle ( corn oil , 0.1 mL/day ) , drug1 ( 10 microg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day ) and/or drug2 ( 20 mg/kg/day ) , for eight days . 
On the ninth day , the rats were sacrificed and aortic rings , with or without endothelium , were used to generate concentration-response curves to drug1 . 
Aortic rings with intact endothelium from the high-dose ( 4 mg/kg/day ) drug1 group were supersensitive to drug2 compared to the vehicle or low-dose ( 10 microg/kg/day ) estradiol groups ( pD2 values = 7.86+/-0.09 , 7.30+/-0.11 and 7.35+/-0.04 , respectively ) . 
Endothelium-intact aortic rings from high- drug1 rats were supersensitive to drug2 when compared to vehicle- , drug3 - and drug4 + high- drug5 -treated rats ( pD2 values = 7.77+/-0.12 , 7.21+/-0.13 , 6.93+/-0.04 and 7.22+/-0.18 , respectively ) . 
There were no significant differences among the pD2 values for drug1 in aortic rings without endothelium . 
Both of these effects were endothelium-dependent . 
drug1 and therapeutics . 
Two different types of therapy with drug1 are used : physiological oral drug2 supplementation which is totally atoxic since it palliates drug3 deficiencies by simply normalizing the drug4 intake and pharmacological drug5 therapy which may induce toxicity since it creates iatrogenic drug6 overload . 
Primary and secondary drug1 deficiencies constitute the sole indication of physiological oral drug2 therapy . 
It is therefore necessary to be well acquainted with the clinical and paraclinical pattern of drug1 deficit and to discriminate between drug2 deficiency due to an insufficient drug3 intake which only requires oral physiological supplementation and drug4 depletion related to a dysregulation of the control mechanisms of drug5 status which requires more or less specific regulation of its causal dysregulation . 
Physiological oral drug1 load constitutes the best tool for diagnosis of drug2 deficiency and the first step of its treatment . 
Physiological oral drug1 supplementation ( 5 mg/kg/day ) is easy and can be carried out in the diet or with drug2 s , with practically only one contra-indication : overt renal failure . 
Specific and aspecific treatments of drug1 depletion are tricky using for example drug2 , pharmacological doses of drug3 , physiological doses of drug4 and of drug5 . 
In order to use the pharmacological properties of induced therapeutic hypermagnesaemia , high oral doses of drug1 ( > 10 mg/kg/day ) are advisable for chronic indications and the parenteral route is suitable for acute indications . 
There are 3 types of indications : specific ( for the treatment of some forms of drug1 deficit i.e. acute ) , pharmacological ( i.e. without alterations of drug2 status ) and mixed--pharmacological and aetiopathogenic-- ( for example complications of chronic alcoholism ) . 
Today pharmacological drug1 therapy mainly concerns the obstetrical , cardiological and anaesthesiological fields . 
The main indications are eclampsia , some dysrhythmias ( torsades de pointe particularly ) and myocardial ischaemias . 
But it is now difficult to situate the exact place of the pharmacological indications of drug1 . 
drug1 infusions can only be envisaged in intensive care units with careful monitoring of pulse , arterial pressure , deep tendon reflexes , hourly diuresis , electrocardiogram and respiratory recordings . 
High oral drug1 doses besides their laxative action may bring latent complications which may reduce lifespan . 
There may remain some indications of the laxative and antacid properties of non soluble drug1 , particularly during intermittent haemodialysis . 
Lastly local use of the mucocutaneous and cytoprotective properties of drug1 is still valid , in drug2 and for preservation of transplants particularly . 
The effects of drug1 and drug2 upon drug3 ( drug4 ) -induced locomotion and behavioral changes in mice . 
The behavioral changes of mice induced by acute and repeated i.p. 
injection of drug1 ( drug2 ) were observed by measuring locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior . 
Then , the effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR ) agonists , drug1 and drug2 , on the above behavioral changes induced by drug3 were found . 
The effects of drug1 were very strong and completely depressed the drug2 -induced hyperlocomotion . 
The effects of drug1 were not so strong . 
Repeated injection of drug1 for 20 days into mice induced lower locomotor activity than that in acutely injected mice . 
These behavioral changes may be related with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia . 
In order to examine some molecular mechanisms of drug1 -induced behavioral changes , Northern blot analysis of total RNA from prefrontal cortical tissues of mice treated with drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 was carried out . 
Lack of an effect of drug1 on the disposition of drug2 and drug3 in HIV-infected patients . 
Two studies were conducted in HIV-infected subjects to assess the potential for drug1 to interact with drug2 and drug3 . 
Both studies used 12 subjects . 
The drug1 study dosed subjects with 1200 mg/day of drug2 ( n = 7 ) ( later changed to 600 mg/day [n = 5 ] ) for Days 8 to 21 of a 21-day course of 100 mg , five times/day of drug3 . 
Subjects treated with 200 mg of drug1 twice daily for 21 days received 1200 mg of drug2 or an equivalent amount of placebo/day for Days 8 to 21 . 
drug1 plasma and urine sampling were conducted on Days 1 , 7 , and 21 for drug2 and on Days 7 and 21 for drug3 . 
Peripheral mononuclear cells were also collected for quantitation of phosphorylated drug1 . 
drug1 had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of drug2 , although it significantly decreased the drug3 tmax by 44 % and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated drug4 by 110 % . 
drug1 had no significant effect on drug2 pharmacokinetics . 
Based on the results of these studies , it is concluded that drug1 may be safely coadministered with both drug2 and drug3 . 
Clinical implications of drug1 interactions with five drug2 . 
The intensity , uniformity and time course of drug1 interference by drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 were systematically investigated in 16 patients receiving drug7 therapy . 
Each subject received an individualized fixed daily dose of drug1 and served as his own pre- and postsedative treatment control . 
Prothrombin times were measured four times weekly during five long-term experiments . 
Anticoagulant inhibition was observed during the administration of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 ; 
there was no significant change in prothrombin test results during the trials of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 and drug2 should not be administered to patients receiving drug3 . 
The concurrent use of drugs from these groups is decreasing according to a survey of 200 hospital medical records . 
drug1 and drug2 interact pharmacologically with orally administered drug3 , but the effect is not clinically significant . 
It is concluded that drug1 and drug2 may be administered safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral drug3 therapy . 
Interaction of the constituents of alcoholic beverages in the promotion of liver damage . 
Little has been studied of the adverse effects of the exposure of the liver to the interaction of drug1 with its congeners and drug2 , coexisting in the contents of alcoholic beverages . 
Twenty four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups . 
Two groups ( SH/DA ; SH/FA ) were submitted to daily treatment with synthetic hydroalcoholic solutions containing drug1 , drug2 , higher drug3 and drug4 in the same proportions as those found in most common distilled and fermented alcoholic beverages ; 
the third group ( SH/EA ) was treated with a hydroalcoholic solution of drug1 ; 
the fourth group served as control and received an equivalent volume of an isocaloric solution of drug1 . 
All the animals were killed at the end of the 9th week of the experiment . 
The ratio between the liver weight and body weight was found to be lower in the treated animals than in the control group . 
The histology of the liver was altered in the three groups which were submitted to treatment with the hydroalcoholic solutions , with quantitative and qualitative differences between the groups . 
These results suggest that the hepatoxicity of drug1 in alcoholic beverages is enhanced by interaction with its congeners and drug2 ; 
they also suggest that alcoholic beverages are not equivalent in their potential to cause liver damage . 
Administration of drug1 prophylaxis . 
Successful prophylaxis of manic-depressive disorder requires more than the prescription of drug1 . 
The administrative arrangements in an area of Scotland were accompanied by a 300 % increase in the frequency of admissions for mania , whereas in an area of the West Midlands , a large decrease was achieved . 
Effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 in healthy volunteers . 
The authors examined the effect of the cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , drug1 , at steady state on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 following a single dose in healthy subjects . 
Each healthy subject ( N = 10 ) received drug1 ( 75 mg once daily ) or placebo for 11 days in a double-blind , randomized , balanced , two-period crossover study . 
A single 0.5 mg oral dose of drug1 elixir was administered on the 7th day of each 11-day period . 
Each treatment period was separated by 14 to 21 days . 
Samples for plasma and urine immunoreactive drug1 concentrations were collected through 120 hours following the drug2 dose . 
No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were observed for any of the calculated drug1 pharmacokinetic parameters . 
For drug1 AUC ( 0-infinity ) , AUC ( 0-24 ) , and Cmax , the geometric mean ratios ( 90 % confidence interval ) for ( drug2 + drug3 /placebo + drug4 ) were 1.04 ( 0.94 , 1.14 ) , 1.02 ( 0.94 , 1.09 ) , and 1.00 ( 0.91 , 1.10 ) , respectively . 
The drug1 median tmax was 0.5 hours for both treatments . 
The harmonic mean elimination half-life was 45.7 and 43.4 hours for drug1 + drug2 and placebo + drug3 treatments , respectively . 
drug1 is eliminated renally . 
The mean ( SD ) cumulative urinary excretion of immunoreactive drug1 after concurrent treatment with drug2 or placebo was 228.2 ( +/- 30.8 ) and 235.1 ( +/- 39.1 ) micrograms/120 hours , respectively . 
Transient and minor adverse events occurred with similar frequency on placebo and drug1 treatments , and no treatment-related pattern was apparent . 
drug1 did not influence the plasma pharmacokinetics or renal elimination of a single oral dose of drug2 . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 : comparison of antiaddictive efficacy , toxicity , and mechanisms of action . 
drug1 , a novel iboga alkaloid congener , is being developed as a potential treatment for multiple forms of drug abuse . 
Like drug1 ( 40 mg/kg ) , drug2 ( 40 mg/kg ) decreases the intravenous self-administration of drug3 and drug4 and the oral self-administration of drug5 and drug6 in rats ; 
unlike drug1 , drug2 does not affect responding for a nondrug reinforcer ( water ) . 
Both drug1 and drug2 ameliorate drug3 withdrawal signs . 
Both drug1 and drug2 decrease extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens , but only drug3 increases extracellular levels of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens . 
Both drug1 and drug2 block drug3 -induced and drug4 -induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens ; 
only drug1 enhances drug2 -induced increases in accumbal dopamine . 
Both drug1 and drug2 enhance the locomotor and/or stereotypic effects of stimulants . 
drug1 attenuates , but drug2 potentiates , the acute locomotor effects of drug3 ; 
both compounds attenuate drug1 -induced locomotion in drug2 -experienced rats . 
drug1 produces whole body tremors and , at high doses ( > or = 100 mg/kg ) , cerebellar damage ; 
drug1 does not produce these effects . 
drug1 , but not drug2 , decreases heart rate at high doses . 
While drug1 and drug2 have similar affinities for kappa opioid and possibly nicotinic receptors , drug3 has much lower affinities than drug4 for NMDA and sigma-2 receptors , sodium channels , and the 5-HT transporter . 
Both drug1 and drug2 are sequestered in fat and , like drug3 , drug4 probably has an active metabolite . 
The data suggest that drug1 has a narrower spectrum of actions and will have a substantially greater therapeutic index than drug2 . 
Effect of coadministered drugs and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drugs to human serum in vitro . 
The effects of coadministered drugs and drug1 on the binding of therapeutic drugs to human serum in vitro was investigated . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 were added to pooled human serum at therapeutic concentrations . 
To each preparation was added one additional drug at three concentrations ranging from therapeutic to toxic . 
The following eight target drug/added drug combinations were studied : drug1 / drug2 . 
drug1 / drug2 , drug3 / drug4 , drug5 / drug6 , drug7 / drug8 , drug9 / drug10 , drug11 / drug12 , and drug13 / drug14 . 
Each serum without the other added drug as well as the serum supplemented with the other drug at the three concentrations was dialyzed against phosphate buffer . 
Similarly dialyzed were drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 , both alone at therapeutic concentrations in serum and with drug4 at three different concentrations in serum . 
The percentage of drug binding in each preparation was calculated . 
drug1 diminished the binding of drug2 to human serum by a net change of 5.7 % ( percentage increase in free drug fraction [FDF ] , 11.0 % ) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 13.7 % ) at 1324 micromol/L . 
drug1 decreased the binding of drug2 by a net change of 6.8 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 8.8 % ) at 277.5 micromol/L ; 
drug1 reduced it by a net change of 6.6 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 8.5 % ) at 431 micromol/L . 
drug1 diminished binding of drug2 by a net change of 9.9 % ( percentage increase in FDF , 21.2 % ) at 1732 micromol/L . 
No significant effects were noted with other drug combinations or with the addition of drug1 . 
Coingestion of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 with drug4 , and drug5 with drug6 at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug . 
The resulting increase in free drug concentration may lead to enhanced drug effect in vivo . 
Effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
The effect of drug1 on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug2 was evaluated in a randomized , double-blind study . 
Five days of drug1 treatment did not significantly affect steady-state pharmacokinetic variables of drug2 compared with placebo ; 
therefore , the use of drug1 does not necessitate an adjustment in drug2 dose to maintain therapeutic digoxin levels . 
Acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of drug1 in anhydrous and aqueous drug2 solutions . 
The drug1 are a family of drug2 and drug3 . 
When taken concurrently with drug1 , a pharmacological interaction may occur , potentiating the central nervous system depression produced by either drug . 
In addition to this pharmacological interaction , this report describes a novel chemical reaction between drug1 ( a drug2 ) and drug3 under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo , resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product . 
Optimal conditions , kinetics , equilibrium , and the mechanism of this acid-catalyzed ethanolysis are reported . 
The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume drug1 and drug2 on a regular basis . 
The acid-catalyzed drug1 -drug reaction is a relatively unexplored area and may alter the pharmacological action of some drugs . 
Inhibitory effects of drug1 on inositol 1,4 , 5-trisphosphate-induced responses in rat megakaryocytes . 
The effects of drug1 ( drug2 ) on drug3 ( drug4 ) -induced responses were studied in rat bone marrow megakaryocytes with the patch-clamp whole-cell recording technique in combination with fura-2 microfluorometry . 
Internal application of drug1 ( 100 microM ) increased intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) concentration ( [Ca ( 2+ ) ] ( i ) ) and activated the Ca ( 2+ ) -dependent K ( + ) current . 
Administering drug1 together with drug2 ( 100-500 microM ) inhibited InsP ( 3 ) -induced responses ( both Ca ( 2+ ) and current responses ) in a dose-dependent fashion . 
Pretreatment of megakaryocytes with extracellular drug1 ( 50 microM ) also inhibited drug2 -induced responses . 
Intracellular and extracellular application of drug1 reduced ADP-induced increases in [Ca ( 2+ ) ] ( i ) . 
In contrast , in isolated single pancreatic acinar cells , drug1 had no effect on drug2 -induced responses . 
Taken together , these results suggest that the site of the inhibitory action of drug1 is at the InsP ( 3 ) receptor , or its closely associated proteins . 
In addition , we have shown that drug1 is a useful pharmacological tool with which to examine the drug2 -mediated responses of megakaryocytes . 
Concomitant drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 chemotherapy plus drug5 therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related , non-Hodgkin lymphoma . 
BACKGROUND : The feasibility and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and drug1 therapy ( HAART ) is still unknown in patients with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -related malignancies . 
To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy plus HAART on the clinical course of patients with HIV-related , systemic , non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( HIV-NHL ) , the authors compared retrospectively a group of 24 patients with HIV-NHL who were treated with the drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ( CHOP ) chemotherapy regimen plus HAART with a group of 80 patients who were treated with CHOP chemotherapy or a CHOP-like regimen ( i.e. , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 with drug9 plus drug10 ) without receiving drug11 therapy . 
METHODS : All patients were enrolled in two sequential trials performed at the Aviano Cancer Center , Italy , from April 1988 to December 1998 . 
HAART was included with combination therapy from January 1997 . 
drug1 regimens consisted of two drug2 and one drug3 . 
RESULTS : The two treatment groups were well matched with regard to patient demographics , NHL characteristics , HIV status , and treatment , i.e. , the number of cycles and chemotherapy dose . 
The response rates were similar between the two groups . 
Severe anemia ( Grade 3-4 according to the World Health Organization criteria ) was significantly greater in the patients who received CHOP-HAART compared with the patients who received CHOP alone ( 33 % vs. 7 % , respectively ; P = 0.001 ) . 
Leukopenia was similar between the two groups , but colony stimulating factor support was significantly greater in the CHOP-HAART group than in the control group ( 92 % vs. 66 % , respectively ; P = 0.03 ) . 
Seventeen percent of CHOP-HAART patients developed severe autonomic neurotoxicity , whereas none of the CHOP patients developed neurotoxicity ( P = 0.002 ) . 
At similar median follow-up , opportunistic infection ( OI ) rates and mortality were significantly lower in the CHOP-HAART patients than in the CHOP patients ( 18 % vs. 52 % , respectively ; P = 0.05 ; and 38 % vs. 85 % , respectively ; P = 0.001 ) . 
The median survival for CHOP-HAART patients was not reached , whereas the medial survival of CHOP patients was 7 months ( P = 0.03 ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of CHOP plus HAART is feasible and may reduce the morbidity from OIs in HIV-NHL patients . 
However , careful attention must be directed to cross toxicity and possible pharmacokinetic interactions between drug1 and drug2 . 
The impact of the combined chemotherapy plus HAART treatment on patient survival needs urgently to be evaluated in prospective studies . 
drug1 and drug2 : a drug interaction . 
The drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 is not well known . 
drug1 has been reported to increase the drug2 requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 resulted in the need for an unusually high maintenance dose of drug3 ( 20 mg per day ) in order to produce a therapeutic effect . 
Withdrawal of drug1 decreased the drug2 requirement by 50 % . 
This effect may be mediated by the ability of drug1 to induce microsomal enzymes and , thus , the catabolism of drug2 . 
The effect of drug1 on the drug2 requirement of our patient appeared to be maximal 5 to 7 days after the initiation of drug3 and extended a similar length of time after drug4 withdrawal . 
This interaction appears to be clinically significant . 
Increased stability of nucleophosmin/B23 in anti-apoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
We obtained evidence that increased stability of nucleophosmin/B23 is involved in antiapoptotic effect of ras during serum deprivation . 
Nucleophosmin/B23 in serum-deprived ( 0 % serum ) NIH-3T3 cells was found to be highly unstable with a half-life less than 4 h . 
In contrast , nucleophosmin/B23 in serum-deprived ras-transformed ( RAS-3T3 ) cells was as stable as that in serum-supplemented NIH-3T3 or RAS-3T3 cells . 
Treatment of RAS-3T3 cells with nucleophosmin/B23 antisense oligomer significantly potentiated the apoptosis induced by serum deprivation . 
Much less caspase-3 activity was noted in the lysate derived from serum-deprived RAS-3T3 cells compared with that in the lysate of serum-deprived NIH-3T3 cells . 
Cell permeable caspase-3 inhibitor added in the medium blocked the decrease of nucleophosmin/B23 and apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in NIH-3T3 cells . 
The inhibitor , on the other hand , promoted significant decrease of nucleolin/C23 in NIH-3T3 cells during serum deprivation . 
Unlike nucleolin/C23 , down-regulation of nucleophosmin/B23 was thus not proliferation-dependent but caspase-3- and apoptosis-dependent . 
Our results indicate important relationships among ras , nucleophosmin/B23 , activation of caspase-3 , and induction of apoptosis . 
drug1 : mammalian target of drug2 inhibitor to prevent kidney rejection . 
Current immunosuppressive therapies are effective but can be associated with significant adverse reactions . 
drug1 works differently from the drug2 currently available , and except for increased lipid levels , the adverse reaction profile of drug3 does not appear to overlap to any great extent with that associated with drug4 or drug5 . 
While additional research is needed , the initial clinical data in kidney recipients suggest that drug1 , in combination with drug2 or drug3 , might have the potential to reduce the frequency of rejection episodes , permit reductions in drug4 or drug5 dosage , and permit steroid withdrawal ( Kelly , 1999 ) . 
Development and pharmacology of drug1 . 
drug1 is the first drug2 to be approved for clinical use , and has been studied extensively in humans since 1986 . 
It is structurally distinct from the other currently available drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ) , leading to unique biopharmaceutical properties relative to the other agents of this class . 
Absorption of drug1 is virtually complete across all species , including man , and is not affected by the presence of food . 
Systemic exposure is limited , as drug1 is subject to first-pass metabolism , and the plasma half-life of the drug is approximately 30 minutes . 
Some 95 % of a single dosage of drug1 is excreted via the biliary route , with less than 2 % of this being the parent compound . 
Additionally , there is no evidence of circulating active metabolites or accumulation during chronic dosing . 
Studies of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of drug1 have demonstrated marked reductions in the rate of bioavailability--from 40 % to 60 % ; 
however , a comparison of drug1 administration with the evening meal or at bedtime has revealed no significant differences in the extent of bioavailability ( area under the curve ) of these two regimens . 
Furthermore , no significant difference in pharmacodynamic effect ( reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ) could be ascertained between mealtime dosing and bedtime dosing . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 have also been assessed in various demographic groups . 
Relative to the general population , plasma concentrations of drug1 do not vary as a function of either age or gender . 
In addition , administration to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in both the rate and extent of bioavailability relative to controls . 
Also , although minimal alterations of drug1 clearance in patients with renal insufficiency are anticipated due to limited renal excretion ( 5 % ) , a study in this patient group is currently underway to examine this further . 
Interaction studies have been performed with drug1 and several drugs with which it might be coadministered . 
drug1 , an anionic-binding resin , has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of drug2 bioavailability . 
Although this effect was noted even when drug1 was given 4 hours prior to drug2 , this regimen did not result in diminished efficacy . 
Further , no effects on either drug1 levels or prothrombin times were observed in a study involving concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 . 
Moreover , additional interaction studies with drug1 and drug2 have not demonstrated any effect on drug3 plasma levels , and administration to a patient population chronically receiving drug4 resulted in no difference in the extent of bioavailability of drug5 relative to control data . 
The results generated to date in clinical pharmacokinetic studies with drug1 thus support its use in a broad population of hypercholesterolaemic patients . 
Molecular basis for the selective toxicity of drug1 for yeast and drug2 for animal cells . 
Among the drug1 , many , like drug2 , cannot be used clinically because they are toxic ; 
drug1 , however , is useful in therapy of human fungal infections because it is less toxic . 
Both the toxicity of drug1 and the therapeutic value of drug2 can be rationalized at the cellular and molecular level by the following observations : ( i ) these drug3 showed differential effects on cells ; 
drug1 was more potent in lysing human red blood cells , whereas drug2 was more potent in inhibiting yeast cell growth ; 
and ( ii ) the effects of drug1 were more efficiently inhibited by added cholesterol , the major membrane sterol in human cells , whereas the effects of drug2 were more efficiently inhibited by ergosterol , the major membrane sterol in yeast . 
The simplest inference is that the toxicity and effectiveness of polyenes are determined by their relative avidities for the predominant sterol in cell membranes . 
[Hippocampus as interaction sites between cerebral memory systems ] Most of the current theories assume that there are multiple forms of memory that are supported by separate brain systems and have different characteristics . 
Animals studies on the various dual-memory theories have been carried out mainly on the basis of hippocampal system function . 
Specifically , they have focused on aspects of learning and memory that are impaired ( vs. spared ) by lesions of the hippocampal formation . 
However , there are several instances in the animal literature showing that hippocampal lesions actually produced enhanced learning and memory function . 
Moreover , the acquisition of tasks that are facilitated by hippocampal lesions ( or dysfunction ) is nevertheless associated , in intact subjects , with specific neurobiological alterations in the hippocampus . 
This problem has been analysed using two different tasks in mice : a bar-press conditioning and a spatial discrimination task . 
Results showed that , depending on the task considered , the same pharmacological treatment produced either a facilitation or an impairment of acquisition . 
Moreover , each task induced significant alterations in hippocampal adenylate cyclase activity but in opposite directions . 
Together with previous findings , these results suggest that the hippocampus is involved in both the so-called &quot ; hippocampal-dependent&quot ; 
&quot ; hippocampal-independent&quot ; 
forms of memory . 
It is postulated that some of the observed training-induced neurobiological alterations might reflect the interaction between two ( or more ) competing memory systems at the hippocampal level . 
Thus , in addition to its proposed specific information processing functions ( i.e. , relational ) , the hippocampus would play a role in addressing information to the brain memory system that , in a given situation , has the best adaptive value. ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
Behavioral mechanisms underlying the link between smoking and drinking . 
Many people use both drug1 and drug2 ( i.e. , cigarettes and other tobacco products ) . 
The behavioral effects of these two drugs differ , and they do not act on the same target sites in the brain , although they may share , or partly share , certain properties . 
The initiation of drug1 or drug2 use may be precipitated by similar personality characteristics in the user , such as impulsivity and sensation seeking . 
Moreover , the mechanisms underlying the development of dependence may be similar for drug1 and drug2 . 
Thus , certain factors , such as reinforcing drug effects , conditioning processes , automatic behavior , and stress , may influence the development of dependence on both drugs . 
Other factors , such as tolerance and sensitization to the drugs ' actions and the development of withdrawal symptoms , may also contribute to dependence . 
This review discusses the actions of the two drugs on certain brain chemical ( i.e. , neurotransmitter ) systems and the extent to which the effects of the two drugs may interact . 
Vancomycin resistance reversal in enterococci by flavonoids . 
The development of clinical vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci ( VRE ) is a major cause for concern . 
Here we show that a combination of drug1 or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone with drug2 may be used to sensitize resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium to the level of vancomycin-sensitive strains . 
Minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) and viable counts were determined in Iso-sensitest broth using a microtitre method . 
MICs of drug1 against 67 % of resistant clinical isolates and a type strain of enterococci were lowered from > 250 microg mL ( -1 ) to 1 
4 microg mL ( -1 ) in the presence of drug1 ( 12.5 microg mL ( -1 ) ) or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone ( 6.25 microg mL ( -1 ) ) . 
Viable counts for type culture E . 
faecalis ATCC 51299 showed the flavonoids alone significantly lowered numbers of colony forming units ( CFUs ) . 
CFUs were maintained at low levels ( 10 ( 3 ) CFU mL ( -1 ) ) for 24 h by drug1 /flavone combinations . 
This combinational action in reversing vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlights novel drug targets and has importance in the design of new therapeutic regimes against resistant pathogens . 
Lack of interaction between drug1 and drug2 : pharmacokinetics and drug disposition . 
Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of drug1 and drug2 when administered concomitantly with an intravenous drug3 such as drug4 . 
This decrease in absorption results in a 36 % and 50 % lower AUC for drug1 and drug2 , respectively , which could cause clinical failures . 
The authors investigated the possibility of a similar interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
Eight healthy volunteers were randomized in an open-label , two-way crossover study to receive drug1 , 5 mg p.o. 
Q4H , and drug1 , 500 mg p.o. 
1 hour after starting the drug1 or drug2 500 mg p.o. 
alone . 
Blood samples were drawn at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 18 , and 24 hours for Cmax , tmax , and AUC determinations . 
There was not a significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) in AUC ( 48.59 +/- 8.52 vs. 49.9 +/- 9.93 ) , Cmax ( 7.73 +/- 2.6 vs. 6.6 +/- 2.0 ) , and tmax ( 1.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.6 +/- 1.1 ) for drug1 versus drug2 / drug3 regimens . 
It was concluded that oral drug1 and drug2 can be administered concomitantly without a significant decrease in AUC , Cmax , or tmax . 
The mode of toxic action of the pesticide drug1 : the metabolism of drug2 to drug3 . 
The biochemical toxicology of drug1 , a known metabolite of the major ingredient of the pesticide drug2 ( drug3 ) , was investigated in vivo and in vitro . 
Rat kidney homogenates supplemented with coenzyme A , ATP , oxaloacetate , and Mg2+ converted drug1 to drug2 in vitro . 
Administration of drug1 ( 100 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) to rats in vivo resulted in drug2 synthesis in the kidney , which was preceded by an elevation in fluoride levels and followed by citrate accumulation . 
Animals dosed with drug1 did not display the 2-3 hour lag phase in either drug2 synthesis or in citrate and fluoride accumulation characteristic of animals dosed with drug3 . 
We demonstrate that the conversion of drug1 to drug2 by an NAD+-dependent oxidation is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the toxic product , drug3 from drug4 . 
Prior administration of drug1 ( 90 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) was shown to prevent the conversion of drug2 ( 100 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) to drug3 in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in drug4 -intoxicated animals . 
However , administration of drug1 ( 90 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) to rats 2 hours prior to drug2 ( 100 mg kg ( -1 ) body weight ) was ineffective in preventing drug3 synthesis and did not diminish fluoride or citrate accumulation in vivo . 
We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of drug1 seen in animals treated with drug2 derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting drug3 to drug4 in the committed step of the toxic pathway . 
drug1 -induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver is prevented by drug2 or drug3 . 
Considering that the involvement of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) has been implicated in the toxicity of various pesticides , this study was designed to investigate the possibility of oxidative stress induction by drug1 , a drug2 . 
Either single ( 170 mg/kg ) or repeated ( 75 mg/kg per day for 5 days ) oral administration of drug1 was found to produce significant oxidative stress in cerebral and hepatic tissues of rats , as was evident by the elevation of the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) in both tissues , either 4 or 24 h after treatment . 
Much higher changes were observed in liver , increasing from a level of 60 % at 4 h up to nearly 4 times the control at 24 h for single dose . 
Reduced levels ( up to 20 % ) of total glutathione ( total GSH ) , and elevation of conjugated dienes ( approximately 60 % in liver by single dose at 4 h ) also indicated the presence of an oxidative insult . 
Glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) activity , however , did not differ from control values for any dose or at any time point in cerebral and hepatic tissues . 
Pretreatment of rats with drug1 ( 100 mg/kg , ip ) or drug2 ( 100 mg/kg per day , ig , for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day ) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues , induced by single high dose of oral drug3 administration within 4 h . 
Thus , the results suggest that drug1 exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage , as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation , which was prevented by drug2 and drug3 . 
Serum drug1 levels using an 125I-labelled antigen : Validation of method and observations on cardiac patients . 
1 . 
Determinations of serum drug1 levels utilizing commercially available kits with an 125I-labelled antigen were precise and not materially different from results obtained with a 3H-labelled antigen . 
2 . 
In order to approximate the steady state level , serum drug1 levels should be drawn either before or at least six hours following the administration of an oral tablet . 
3 . 
Concomitantly given drug1 did not interfere with the absorption of a tablet of drug2 . 
4 . 
In the digitalized patient , slow alterations in serum levels after oral administration appeared well correlated with , at least , the negative chronotropic effects of the drug . 
5 . 
Maximal exercise testing , a maneuver often applied to cardiac patients , does not significantly alter the serum drug1 level . 
Analysis of drug1 -induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats . 
The drug1 ( drug2 ) -induced diarrhea was analyzed in cecectomized rats prepared by resecting the cecum and its vasculature without disturbing the ileocecal junction . 
drug1 ( 0.1-1.0 mg/kg , p.o. ) 
dose-dependently increased the number of defecation episodes and induced a soft and watery stool in cecectomized rats . 
At 0.3 mg/kg , the diarrhea-inducing effects of drug1 were more pronounced in cecectomized than in control rats . 
When given i.p. , drug1 ( 0.3 mg/kg ) induced a watery stool in cecectomized and control rats with the same efficacy , although these effects were short-lasting as compared to oral administration . 
drug1 ( 4 ml/kg , p.o. ) 
also induced diarrhea , but did not produce a watery stool in cecectomized rats . 
There were no differences between cecectomized and control rats in basal small intestinal transits or in drug1 ( 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. ) -induced enhancements . 
Moreover , the basal and drug1 -induced jejunal net fluid transfers were the same in cecectomized and in control rats . 
On the other hand , the enhanced secretion of colonic fluid by drug1 , given intraluminally , was only half of that in control rats , whereas the colonic transit-enhancing effect of drug2 in cecectomized rats was more pronounced than in control rats at 15 but not at 30 min after its administration . 
The basal colonic fluid contents and transits were the same in cecectomized and in control rats . 
drug1 and drug2 ( 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. ) 
drug1 and drug2 ( 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg , s.c. ) inhibited the drug3 ( 0.3 mg/kg , p.o. ) -induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats . 
drug1 ( 5 mg/kg , s.c. ) 
drug1 ( 5 mg/kg , s.c. ) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of drug2 and partly antagonized the effect of drug3 . 
These results suggest that oral administration of drug1 induces a more pronounced secretory diarrhea in cecectomized than in control rats , probably due to the lack of the reservoir function of the cecum in the operated animals . 
This secretory diarrhea model is suitable for evaluating the antidiarrheal activity of drugs . 
drug1 as potent drug2 of glucocorticoid-induced mouse mammary tumor virus gene expression . 
The effect of natural and synthetic galloyl esters on glucocorticoid-induced gene expression was evaluated by using rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional regulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus drug1 . 
The glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription was strongly suppressed by synthetic alkyl esters ; 
drug1 showed the most potent inhibition ( 66 % inhibition at 10 microM ) , which was far more potent than that of crude drug2 . 
n-Octyl and n-cetyl gallate also showed good inhibition , while gallic acid itself was not so active , suggesting that the presence of hydrophobic side chain is important for the suppressive effect . 
On the other hand , surprisingly , drug1 , ( - ) -epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate and theasinensin A , potently enhanced the promoter activity ( 182 and 247 % activity at 1 microM , respectively ) . 
The regulation of the level of the glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by the antioxidative gallates is of great interest from a therapeutic point of view . 
High-dose drug1 with drug2 protection . 
Nephrotoxicity frequently limits the dose of drug1 to less than 120 mg/m2 per injection . 
drug1 is a neutralizing agent for drug2 that protects against renal damage . 
To determine whether injection of drug1 would permit larger doses of drug2 to be administered , a fixed 9.9-g/m2 dose of drug3 was given intravenously over three hours concurrently with escalating doses of drug4 . 
drug1 was administered over the last two hours of the drug2 infusion . 
Using this technique , it was possible to escalate the drug1 dose to 225 mg/m2 before dose-limiting toxicities were encountered . 
Comparison of drug1 pharmacokinetics in patients treated with 202.5 mg/m2 plus drug2 to those in patients treated with 100 mg/m2 without drug3 indicated that there were no changes in the elimination rate constant , volume of distribution , or total body clearance of drug4 . 
The total drug exposure for the plasma was approximately twofold at the higher drug1 dose . 
This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of drug1 permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to drug2 . 
Interaction on the antinociceptive effect between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 . 
The aim of this paper was to study the interaction between drug1 and both drug2 or its synthetic analogue drug3 , or drug4 , on the antinonciceptive effect of these peptides in mice after intracisternal injection . 
Antinociception was measured by the hot-plate method . 
It was shown that drug1 antagonized evidently the antinociceptive effect of drug2 and their analogue . 
On the contrary , drug1 and drug2 were agonists in induction of analgesia . 
It is concluded that drug1 modulates in an opposite way the function of the enkephalinergic neurons and the central action of drug2 . 
The emerging roles of drug1 in drug2 therapy . 
The availability of potent drug1 ( drug2 ) -based regimens for drug3 therapy and concerns regarding drug4 ( drug5 ) -related metabolic disturbances have led to significant shifts in treatment practices in HIV infection . 
drug1 -based regimens may have several advantages over drug2 -based therapy for initial or prolonged therapy , including more convenient administration regimens , lower tablet volume , fewer drug interactions , and central nervous system penetration . 
No data from prospective clinical trials currently exist comparing the 3 approved agents ( drug1 , drug2 or drug3 ) . 
Both drug1 and drug2 have been compared to triple therapy with the drug3 drug4 over 48 weeks as initial therapy , with similar responses being observed with drug5 regimens and superiority observed with drug6 . 
A smaller 24-week study has suggested drug1 may be superior to the drug2 drug3 . 
Limited comparative data in patients with high viral loads treated with drug1 - or drug2 -based regimens currently exist . 
However , cohort data and selected patient data from clinical trials suggest comparable activity to drug1 -based regimens in these patients . 
The superiority of drug1 over drug2 -based regimens has been observed in comparative data in a subset of patients with high viral loads . 
In treatment-experienced patients , available uncontrolled data suggest these agents contribute to regimen efficacy in drug1 -na ve , treatment-experienced patients . 
drug1 has demonstrated superiority over drug2 in nucleoside-experienced patients , although combining these 2 agents may represent the best approach in these circumstances . 
The tolerability of drug1 appears generally good with few individuals discontinuing in clinical studies as a result of adverse drug events . 
The majority of adverse events with drug1 occur within the first month , and are predictable and manageable without therapy interruption . 
Suppression by drug1 of drug2 -enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by drug3 in wistar rats . 
BACKGROUND : The effects of combined administration of drug1 and drug2 ( drug3 ) , a drug4 , on the incidence of peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by drug5 ( drug6 ) and the labeling index of intestinal cancers were investigated in male Wistar rats . 
METHODS : From the beginning of the experiment , rats were given 10 weekly subcutaneous injections of drug1 ( 7.4 mg/kg body weight ) and subcutaneous injections of drug2 ( 40 microg/kg body weight ) every other day , and from week 16 , intraperitoneal injections of drug3 ( 10 or 20 mg/kg body weight ) every other day until the end fo the experiment in week 45 . 
RESULTS : drug1 significantly increased the incidence of intestinal tumors and cancer metastasis to the peritoneum . 
Although drug1 administered at either dose had little or no effect on the enhancement of intestinal carcinogenesis by drug2 or on the location , histologic type , depth of involvement , labeling index , apoptotic index or tumor vascularity of intestinal cancers , it significantly decreased the incidence of cancer metastasis . 
drug1 also significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinomas , which was enhanced by drug2 . 
CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that drug1 inhibits cancer metastasis through actions that do not affect the growth of intestinal cancers . 
[Dose-time effects of competitive displacement of drug1 by drug2 following oral and intravenous administration ] The effect of various doses of drug3 in several dose fractions on the extent and the time scale of displacement of drug4 , in dependence on application mode , was studied . 
An intravenous dose of 50 mg drug1 was in respect of competitive suppression of organs actively concentrating drug2 as effective as intravenous 1000 mg ClO-4- simultaneously or 1000 mg orally 30 min before the injection of drug3 . 
An intravenous injection of drug1 given later also produces a complete and immediately beginning depletion of drug2 already accumulated in the thyroid , within a period of 195 min after 99m-TcO-4-injection with a corresponding increase in blood levels . 
20 mg result in incomplete depletion which becomes complete after a second additional dose . 
The intravenous application of drug1 offers advantages in clinical use . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 : effects on drug discrimination and behavioral inhibition in rats . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) produces psychotomimetic effects in humans that resemble schizophrenia symptoms . 
In an effort to screen compounds for antipsychotic activity , preclinical researchers have investigated whether these compounds block drug1 -induced behaviors in animals . 
In the present study , the drug1 drug2 was tested in combination with an active dose of drug3 in two-lever drug discrimination and mixed signalled-unsignalled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rates ( DRL ) procedures . 
drug1 produced distinctive effects in each task : it substituted for the training dose in drug2 discrimination and it increased the number of responses with short ( &lt ; 3 s ) interresponse times as well as increasing overall response rates in the DRL schedule . 
Acute dosing with drug1 failed to alter the behavioral effects of drug2 in either procedure even when tested up to doses that produced pharmacological effects alone . 
These results suggest that acute dosing with drug1 would not affect behaviors most closely associated with drug2 intoxication . 
Further , they bring into question the utility of using drug1 combination procedures in animals to screen for antipsychotic potential . 
Since chronic dosing is required for therapeutic efficacy of drug1 , future studies should focus on investigation of chronic dosing effects of these drugs in combination with drug2 . 
[Multiple occupational exposure to solvents ] This article review papers published over the last 20 years on multiple occupational exposure to solvents . 
At low-levels of exposure the toxicokinetic interferences between solvents have generally not been observed in man and presumably a threshold limit exists . 
Conversely , at exposure levels close to the &quot ; limit values&quot ; 
metabolic interference has sometimes been observed and the behaviour of the biological indicators differs from what would be expected . 
Toxicodynamic interference between solvents can give rise to additive , potentiation , synergistic , antagonistic effects . 
For the identification of &quot ; limit values&quot ; , it has generally been suggested in the literature that the possible effects deriving from multiple exposure be considered as additive . 
However , numerous potentiation effects have frequently been reported for combined exposure to substances of widespread use . 
In this paper lists of multiple exposure in which the doses of the substances , the types of interferences and the behaviour of the biological levels have been drawn up and proposed as a tool for easy consultation . 
drug1 and drug2 exert additive ocular and renal vasodilator effects on healthy humans . 
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : There is evidence that drug1 and drug2 cause renal and ocular vasodilation . 
There is , however , currently no data on the effect of combined hyperglycaemia and hyper drug1 aemia on the renal and ocular blood flow seen in diabetic patients on insulin therapy . 
METHODS : We carried out two different 3-way crossover studies in healthy subjects ( each , n = 9 ) . 
In study one , hyperglycaemic clamps ( 5.6 mmol/l , 11.1 mmol/ 1 , 16.7 mmol/l ) were carried out during placebo or drug1 ( dose 1 : 1 mU/kg/min ; dose 2 : 2 mU/kg/min ) infusion . 
The second study was identical but endogenous insulin secretion was blocked with drug1 . 
The renal plasma flow , glomerular filtration rate and pulsatile choroidal blood flow were measured using the paraaminohippurate method , the inulin method and a laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude , respectively . 
RESULTS : drug1 increased renal plasma flow and fundus pulsation amplitude but not the glomerular filtration rate . 
Hyperglycaemia increased all the renal and ocular parameters studied . 
Haemodynamic effects of drug1 and drug2 were additive when drug3 was co-administered but not under basal conditions . 
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : drug1 and drug2 can exert additive vasodilator properties on renal and ocular circulation . 
To find out whether this observation is related to the increased regional perfusion in diabetes longitudinal studies on patients with Type I ( insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus are needed . 
Interaction between drug1 and antidiuretic hormone and its effect on the milk secretion by alveoli of the mammary gland of lactating rats . 
Interaction between exogenous and endogenous drug1 and vasopressin was found to affect the mechanism of milk ejection by the alveoli of the mammary gland in lactating rats . 
Inhibition and stimulation of the effect of drug1 on milk ejection by vasopressin was demonstrated . 
On the basis of the principles observed the concentrations fo these hormones were investigated in the plasma of dogs deprived of water for 3 days and then allowed to drink . 
[Quantitative approach to treatment with incisive drug1 by therapeutic monitoring ] ; The problems encountered during the longterm treatment of psychotic patients with drug2 are illustrated by six typical case reports . 
A group of patients who had had a new acute episode despite seemingly adequate treatment were selected . 
In these six cases it was demonstrated that the drug1 dosage was inappropriate , being either too high or too low as judged from the plasma concentrations . 
Ways of improving the adequacy of the treatment of psychotic patients with drug1 are discussed . 
Longitudinal assessment of drug1 in de novo renal transplant recipients over the first post-transplant year : pharmacokinetics , exposure-response relationships , and influence on drug2 . 
OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug1 and drug2 ( INN , drug3 ) when coadministered in de novo kidney allograft recipients during the first year after transplantation . 
METHOD : This study was a multicenter randomized double-blind study of 101 patients who were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive drug1 tablets at doses of 0.5 mg , 1 mg , or 2 mg twice daily with drug2 and drug3 . 
Blood sampling for the pharmacokinetics of drug1 and drug2 was performed on day 1 , on weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , and on months 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 . 
drug1 dose-proportionality and stability over time were assessed in the context of linear regression and ANOVA models . 
drug1 exposure-response relationships between area under the blood concentration-time curve ( AUC ) and changes in platelets , leukocytes , and lipids were explored with the median-effect model . 
Potential differences in drug1 dosing and pharmacokinetics at different levels of drug2 exposure were assessed in the context of ANOVA . 
RESULTS : drug1 steady state was reached on or before day 7 , with a median 3-fold accumulation of drug exposure compared with that after the first postoperative dose . 
Both steady-state maximum concentration and AUC were dose proportional over the full dose range when assessed on day 1 , as well as for the full duration of the study at steady state . 
There was evidence for longitudinal stability in AUC of drug1 during the course of the study . 
The interindividual pharmacokinetic variability for AUC was 85.4 % and intraindividual , interoccasion variability was 40.8 % . 
Age ( range , 17-69 years ) , weight ( range , 49-106 kg ) , and sex ( 65 men and 36 women ) were not significant contributors to variability . 
There was an increasing incidence of transient thrombocytopenia ( or =100 x 10 ( 9 ) /L ) with increasing drug1 AUC ( P = .03 ) . 
drug1 doses , trough concentrations , and AUC exhibited similar temporal patterns during the course of the study regardless of the co-administered drug2 dose level ( P = .13 , .82 , and .76 , respectively ) . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 exhibited dose-proportional , stable exposure during the first post-transplant year . 
For a 4-fold range of drug1 doses there were no differential effects on drug2 dosing or pharmacokinetics . 
Toxicity of cadmium and drug1 to encystment and in vitro excystment of Parorchis acanthus ( Digenea : Philophthalmidae ) . 
The toxicity of cadmium , drug1 and cadmium/zinc mixtures at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 50000 microg/l were investigated against cercariae and metacercariae of Parorchis acanthus obtained from the dog whelk Nucella lapillus . 
Cercarial encystment at concentrations of 25000 microg/l or higher was significantly impaired by all test metals ; 
however , at lower concentrations only drug1 demonstrated toxicity . 
Mixtures of cadmium and drug1 had a synergistic effect compared with single metal toxicity but only at 50000 microg/l . 
Excystment in vitro was only significantly affected by cercariae exposed to cadmium/zinc mixtures whilst encysting . 
Twenty-four h exposures of fully formed cysts had no effect on excystment in vitro . 
Effects on in vitro excystment rates over a 2 h period demonstrated widespread effects for cercariae-exposed P . 
acanthus . 
No effects were evident on excystment rates of cyst-exposed parasites .
