The concomitant intake of drug1 and drug2 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug3 or drug4 . 
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that administration of drug1 or drug2 does not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
Co-administration of drug1 with drug2 produced a 25 % increase in AUC and a 33 % increase in the Cmax of drug3 . 
No adjustment of dosage is recommended in such patients . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 and its major metabolite drug2 were unaffected following co-administration with drug3 . 
Other concomitant therapies : In clinical trials , the safety profile in subjects treated with drug1 concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ( including drug5 ) , or drug6 was similar to that of subjects taking placebo with these concomitant medications . 
Patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 more commonly reported both weight gain and weight loss , compared with patients taking either medication alone . 
Drug interactions between drug1 and other drugs have not been fully evaluated . 
Drugs which may potentiate the release of neutrophils , such as drug1 , should be used with caution . 
drug1 may augment the activity of other drug2 . 
Concomitant use with other drug1 is not recommended . 
drug1 is highly bound to human plasma protein ( mean 99.2 % ) . 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 The in vitro binding of drug5 to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by drug6 ( 99.5 % control vs 99.3 % ) when drug7 plasma concentrations reach 5 to10 m g/mL . 
drug1 does not alter drug2 protein binding . 
In vitro studies indicate that , at therapeutic concentrations of drug1 ( 300 m g/mL ) , the binding of drug2 was reduced from approximately 99.2 % to 97.5 % , representing a potential twofold increase in unbound drug3 plasma levels . 
Therapeutic concentrations of drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 andtolbutamide did not alter drug8 protein binding . 
In a study involving 12 adult volunteers , TORADOLORAL was coadministered with a single dose of 25 mg drug1 , causing no significant changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drug2 . 
In another study , TORADOLIV/IM was given with two doses of 5000 U of drug1 to 11 healthy volunteers , resulting in a mean template bleeding time of 6.4 minutes ( 3.2 to 11.4 min ) compared to a mean of 6.0 minutes ( 3.4 to 7.5 min ) for drug2 alone and 5.1 minutes ( 3.5 to 8.5 min ) for placebo . 
Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 , the administration of drug4 to patients taking drug5 should be done extremely cautiously , and patients should be closely monitored . 
drug1 : drug2 IV/IM reduced the drug3 response to drug4 in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20 % ( mean sodium and urinary output decreased 17 % ) . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 ORAL and drug3 resulted in decreased clearance of drug4 and significant increases in drug5 plasma levels ( total AUC increased approximately threefold from 5.4 to 17.8 m g/h/mL ) and terminal half-life increased approximately twofold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours . 
Therefore , concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated . 
drug1 : Inhibition of renal drug2 clearance , leading to an increase in plasma drug3 concentration , has been reported with some prostaglandin synthesis-inhibiting drugs .

Synergism between drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 ) , drug3 , and other drug4 has been reported . 
This should be considered whenever these agents are prescribed concomitantly . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 , which competes for tubular secretion , has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of drug3 . 
Few systemic data have been collected on the metabolism of drug1 following concomitant administration with other drugs or , alternatively , the effect of concomitant administration of drug2 on the metabolism of other drugs . 
Because drug1 is extensively metabolized , the coadministration of other drugs may affect its clinical activity . 
In vitro studies indicate that drug1 is primarily metabolized to drug2 by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme . 
Therefore , the potential exists for a drug interaction between drug1 and drugs that affect the CYP2B6 isoenzyme ( e.g. , drug2 and drug3 ) . 
The drug1 metabolite of drug2 does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
The effects of concomitant administration of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers . 
Following oral administration of two 150-mg sustained-release tablets with and without 800 mg of drug1 , the pharmacokinetics of drug2 and drug3 were unaffected . 
However , there were 16 % and 32 % increases in the AUC and Cmax , respectively , of the combined moieties of drug1 and drug2 . 
While not systematically studied , certain drugs may induce the metabolism of drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) . 
Animal data indicated that drug1 may be an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans . 
In one study , following chronic administration of drug1 , 100 mg 3 times daily to 8 healthy male volunteers for 14 days , there was no evidence of induction of its own metabolism . 
Nevertheless , there may be the potential for clinically important alterations of blood levels of coadministered drugs . 
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450IID6 ( CYP2D6 ) : Many drugs , including most drug1 ( SSRIs , many drug2 ) , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme . 
Although drug1 is not metabolized by this isoenzyme , drug2 and drug3 are inhibitors of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme in vitro . 
In a study of 15 male subjects ( ages 19 to 35 years ) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme , daily doses of drug1 given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg drug2 increased the Cmax , AUC , and t1/2 of drug3 by an average of approximately 2 - , 5 - and 2-fold , respectively . 
The effect was present for at least 7 days after the last dose of drug1 . 
Concomitant use of drug1 with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally studied . 
Therefore , co-administration of drug1 with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain drug2 ( e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) , drug9 ( e.g. , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ) , drug13 ( e.g. , drug14 ) , and drug15 ( e.g. , drug16 , drug17 ) , should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication . 
If drug1 is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6 , the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered , particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index . 
drug1 : Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of drug2 is enhanced by the drug3 drug4 . 
drug1 and drug2 : Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving drug3 concurrently with either drug4 or drug5 . 
Administration of drug1 Tablets to patients receiving either drug2 or drug3 concurrently should be undertaken with caution , using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases . 
Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold : Concurrent administration of drug1 and agents ( e.g. , drug2 , other drug3 , drug4 , systemic drug5 , etc. ) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution . 
Low initial dosing and small gradual dose increases should be employed . 
drug1 Transdermal System : . 
drug1 : In post-marketing experience , there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced drug2 tolerance in patients who were drinking drug3 during treatment with drug4 .

If the usual amounts of nondepolarizing relaxants are given , the time for recovery from neuromuscular blockade will be longer in the presence of drug1 than when drug2 or drug3 with a balanced technique are used . 
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of drug1 reportedly are increased by chronic administration of high doses of drug2 . 
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions , desirable or undesirable , involving drug1 even though drug2 has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs , including other cytotoxic drugs . 
drug1 treatment , which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity , potentiates the effect of drug2 . 
If a patient has been treated with drug1 within 10 days of general anesthesia , the anesthesiologist should be alerted . 
Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when drug1 is administered in combination with other drug2 such as drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or inhalation general drug6 . 
Postoperative respiratory depression may be enhanced or prolonged by these agents . 
In such cases of combined treatment , the dose of one or both agents should be reduced . 
Limited clinical experience indicates that requirements for drug1 are reduced by 30 to 50 % for the first sixty ( 60 ) minutes following drug2 induction The concomitant use of drug3 with drug4 can significantly inhibit drug5 clearance and may increase the risk of prolonged or delayed respiratory depression . 
drug1 reduces the clearance of drug2 . 
Therefore smaller drug1 doses will be required with prolonged administration and the duration of action of drug2 my be extended . 
Perioperative administration of drugs affecting hepatic blood flow or enzyme function may reduce plasma clearance and prolong recovery . 
drug1 should not be administered concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 .

drug1 administration to three cancer patients over a dose range of 0.025 mg to 2.2 mg led to a dose-dependent inhibition of drug2 elimination .14 The effect of alternate-day administration of 0.25 mg of drug3 on drug metabolism in MS patients is unknown . 
Drug-Drug Interactions drug1 - drug2 should be administered with caution to patients being treated with systemically-administered ( oral or intravenous ) drug3 ( or other drug4 ) because the action of drug5 on the cardiovascular system can be potentiated resulting in increases in heart rate and blood pressure . 
CYP2D6 inhibitors - drug1 is primarily metabolized by the CYP2D6 pathway to drug2 . 
In EMs , selective inhibitors of CYP2D6 increase drug1 steady-state plasma concentrations to exposures similar to those observed in PMs . 
Dosage adjustment of drug1 may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors , e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
In EM individuals treated with drug1 or drug2 , the AUC of drug3 is approximately 6 - to 8-fold and Css , max is about 3 - to 4-fold greater than drug4 alone . 
In vitro studies suggest that coadministration of cytochrome P450 inhibitors to PMs will not increase the plasma concentrations of drug1 . 
Pressor agents - Because of possible effects on blood pressure , drug1 should be used cautiously with pressor agents . 
Caution should be exercised when drug1 are given in conjunction with drug2 . 
Usually , the dosage of the drug1 should be reduced by one-half ( depending on the individual case ) to maintain the prothrombin time at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications . 
Frequent prothrombin determinations are advisable until it has been determined definitely that the prothrombin level has been stabilized . 
drug1 may displace acidic drugs such as drug2 or drug3 from their binding sites . 
Caution should be exercised when treating patients with either of these drugs or other highly protein-bound drugs and drug1 . 
The hypoglycemic effect of drug1 has been reported to increase when drug2 is given concurrently . 
Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another drug1 and drug2 but may be seen after several months . 
For these reasons , it is felt that , in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone , the possible benefits of combined therapy with drug1 and a drug2 do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy , rhabdomyolysis , and acute renal failure . 
While it is not known whether this interaction occurs with drug1 other than drug2 , myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occasionally been associated with the use of drug3 alone , including drug4 . 
Therefore , the combined use of drug1 with drug2 should generally be avoided . 
Drug Interactions : drug1 may interact with some drugs , like drug2 ( drug3 ) : drug4 could theoretically affect drug5 pharmacodynamics - drug6 - Eproxindine - drug7 : drug8 and drug9 cause additive CNS depression - drug10 : drug11 increases the effect of drug12

Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary . 
In clinical studies performed with drug1 , the concomitant use of oral drug2 ( drug3 ) , drug4 ( drug5 ) , drug6 ( drug7 ) , and drug8 did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of drug9 . 
In addition , drug1 neither influenced the pharmacodynamics of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , nor the pharmacokinetics of drug6 at steady state . 
Agents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of drug1 therapy . 
If co-administration is essential , close monitoring may be appropriate . 
In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes , inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of drug1 by drug2 ( 200 m m M i.e. , 350 mg/L ) was 17-28 % . 
Inhibition of the other isozymes evaluated ( CYPs 2A1 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4 , and 3E1 ) was 0-16 % . 
Since drug1 does not markedly inhibit CYP450s ( CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A4 ) in vitro , drug2 is not expected to significantly interact with other drugs in vivo by inhibition of metabolism mediated by these isozymes . 
Since drug1 does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than ATIII , no drug interactions by protein-binding displacement are expected . 
Prospective studies on the potential for drug1 to interact with other drugs have not been performed .

When drug8 is used concomitantly with injectable drug9 , an increased incidence of sedation , hallucinations , and irrational behavior has been observed . 
drug1 appears to decrease the rate at which certain drugs are metabolized and therefore may increase the blood levels and the possibility of clinical toxicity of drugs given concomitantly . 
drug1 SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN THOSE PATIENTS REVEIVING drug2 AND ITS CONGENERS . 
SINCE THE CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF THESE TWO DRUGS CAN LEAD TO drug1 INTOXICATION , PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING drug2 TO A PATIENT ON drug3 THERAPY , A BASELINE drug4 SERUM LEVEL SHOULD BE OBTAINED . 
SUBSEQUENT TO INITIATION OF drug1 THERAPY . 
SERUM LEVELS OF drug1 SHOULD BE DETERMINED ON DIFFERENT DAYS FOR EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE OR FOR A CONTINUING RISE IN LEVELS .

Testicular atrophy was seen with drug1 administration at doses as low as 30 mg/kg weekly for 6 weeks in rats ( 1/3 the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis ) and as low as 20 mg/kg weekly for 13 weeks in dogs ( approximately equal to the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis ) . 
Persons taking most drug1 , drug2 and drug3 invalidate drug4 and drug5 diagnostic blood assays . 
drug1 drug2 and heavy drug3 intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of drug4 . 
No drugs are known to interfere with the conversion of drug1 to drug2 . 
Conversion could be affected by alterations in the level of phosphatase activity , but given the abundance and wide distribution of phosphatases in the body it is unlikely that drugs would affect this activity enough to affect conversion of drug1 to drug2 . 
Drugs highly bound to albumin could increase the unbound fraction of drug1 . 
Although , it is unknown whether this could result in clinically significant effects , caution is advised when administering drug1 with other drugs that significantly bind to serum albumin . 
The pharmacokinetics and protein binding of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 were not altered when drug4 and drug5 were concurrently administered in single submaximal doses . 
The most significant drug interactions following administration of drug1 are expected to occur with drugs that interact with drug2 . 
drug1 is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement . 
drug1 is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism . 
Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating drug1 concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity . 
drug1 is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes . 
The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below : - Drugs that may increase plasma drug1 concentrations include : acute drug2 intake , drug3 , chboramphenicol , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , drug16 , drug17 , drug18 , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 
. 
- Drugs that may decrease plasma drug1 concentrations include : drug2 , chronic drug3 abuse , drug4 
. 
- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma drug1 concentrations include : drug2 , vaiproic acid , and drug3 . 
Similarly , the effects of drug1 on drug2 , drug3 and sodium plasma drug4 concentrations are unpredictable 
. 
- Although not a true drug interaction , drug1 may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and drug2 dosage may need to be adjusted 
. 
- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by drug1 include : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , oral drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 . 
Monitoring of plasma drug1 concentrations may be helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 may decrease serum concentrations of 14 . 
It may also produce artifactually low results in dexamethasone or metyrapone tests . 
drug1 may also cause increased serum concentrations of glucose , alkaline phosphatase , and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) . 
Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure plasma drug1 concentrations following drug2 administration . 
drug1 and drug2 Administration of drug3 or drug4 in patients ( n = 13 ) and volunteers ( n = 96 ) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 ( the active metabolite of drug5 ) concentration . 
Hepatotoxic Drugs Increased side effects may occur when drug1 is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances . 
This is also to be considered when drug1 treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure . 
In a small ( n = 30 ) combination study of drug1 with drug2 , a 2 - to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients . 
All elevations resolved , 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of drug1 . 
A 3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients . 
All of these also resolved , 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of drug1 . 
Three patients met ACR criteria for liver biopsy ( 1 : Roegnik Grade I , 2 : Roegnik Grade IIIa ) . 
No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified . 
drug1 : In in vitro studies , M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50 % in the free fraction of drug2 and drug3 at concentrations in the clinical range . 
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown ; 
however , there was extensive concomitant use of drug1 in clinical studies and no differential effect was observed . 
drug1 : In in vitro studies , M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50 % in the free fraction of drug2 at concentrations in the clinical range . 
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown . 
drug1 : Following concomitant administration of a single dose of drug2 to subjects receiving multiple doses of drug3 , M1 peak levels were increased ( ~ 40 % ) over those seen when drug4 was given alone . 
Because of the potential for drug1 levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing , caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 : Increased INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) when drug2 and drug3 were co-administered has been rarely reported . 
The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by drug1 and drug2 appears to be low for drugs commonly used in chemotherapy or surgery , because drug3 is eliminated by multiple routes . 
Blood levels of drug1 increased 24 % when drug2 was coadministered with drug3 ( nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 ) for 7 days , and decreased 28 % with coadministration of drug4 ( potent inducer of cytochrome P-450 ) for 7 days . 
drug1 has been safely coadministered with drugs used in chemotherapy and surgery . 
As with other agents which prolong ECG intervals , caution should be exercised in patients taking drugs which prolong ECG intervals , particularly QTc . 
In patients taking drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and various chemotherapy agents , no effect was shown on the clearance of drug8 . 
Clearance of drug1 decreased by about 27 % when drug2 was administered intravenously concomitantly with drug3 . 
drug1 does not influence anesthesia recovery time in patients . 
drug1 did not inhibit the antitumor activity of four drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) in four murine models . 
Coadministration of drug1 with drugs that are known to cause pancreatitis may increase the risk of this toxicity ( see WARNINGS ) and should be done with extreme caution , only if other alternatives are not available , and only if clearly indicated . 
Neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with a history of neuropathy or neurotoxic drug therapy , including drug1 , and these patients may be at increased risk of neuropathy during drug2 therapy ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . 
drug1 : The AUC of drug2 was increased about 4-fold when drug3 at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of drug4 to two patients with renal impairment ( CLcr = 15 and 18 mL/min ) . 
The effects of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetics in subjects with normal renal function are not known . 
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 containing drug3 or drug4 with drug5 Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the drug6 components . 
Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach : Drugs such as drug1 and drug2 should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with drug3 . 
drug1 : Administration of drug2 2 hours prior to or concurrent with oral drug3 was associated with a 111 ( 114 ) % increase in the steady-state AUC of drug4 ( n = 12 ) . 
A 21 ( 17 ) % decrease in the steady-state AUC of drug1 was observed when drug2 was administered 2 hours prior to drug3 , but not when the two drugs were administered simultaneously ( n = 12 ) . 
drug1 s : drug2 should be administered at least 2 hours after or 6 hours before dosing with drug3 because plasma concentrations of drug4 are decreased when administered with drug5 containing drug6 , drug7 , or drug8 . 
In eight HIV-infected patients , the steady-state AUC of drug1 was decreased an average of 26 % ( 95 % CI = 14 % , 37 % ) when drug2 was administered 2 hours prior to a marketed chewable/dispersible tablet formulation of drug3 . 
The AUC of drug1 was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given drug2 and drug3 - placebo tablets concurrently . 
In a single subject given one dose of drug1 2 hours after a dose of drug2 - placebo tablets , a greater than 50 % reduction in the AUC of drug3 was observed . 
Plasma concentrations of drug1 are decreased when administered with drug2 containing drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
The optimal dosing interval for coadministration with drug1 should be determined by consulting the appropriate drug2 package insert . 
Interactions with Other drug1 : Significant decreases in the AUC of drug2 ( 20 % ) and drug3 ( 84 % ) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with drug4 . 
To avoid this interaction , drug1 or drug2 should be given 1 hour prior to dosing with drug3 . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 are not altered to a clinically significant degree when it is administered with a light meal 1 hour after drug2 . 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with drug1 . 
drug1 should not be used with other drug2 . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 should not be administered during drug4 treatment . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Increases in lymphocyte counts related to the pharmacologic mechanism of action are frequently observed during drug1 treatment . 
Concurrent administration of drug1 ( another TNF - blocking agent ) and drug2 ( an drug3 ) has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections , and increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone . 
Other drug1 ( including drug2 ) used in combination with drug3 may also result in similar toxicities . 
Specific drug interaction studies , including interactions with drug1 , have not been conducted . 
The majority of patients in rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn s disease clinical studies received one or more concomitant medications . 
In rheumatoid arthritis , concomitant medications besides drug1 were drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and/or drug5 . 
Concomitant Crohn s disease medications were drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 / drug5 and aminosalicylates . 
In psoriatic arthritis clinical trials , concomitant medications included drug1 in approximately half of the patients as well as drug2 , drug3 and drug4 . 
Patients with Crohn s disease who received drug1 tended to experience fewer infusion reactions compared to patients on no drug2 . 
Serum drug1 concentrations appeared to be unaffected by baseline use of medications for the treatment of Crohn s disease including drug2 , drug3 ( drug4 or drug5 ) and aminosalicylates . 
When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with drug1 . 
- drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 : Potentiation of otthostatic hypotension may occur 
. 
- drug1 : ( Oral agents and drug2 ) Dosage adjustment of the drug3 may be required 
. 
- Other drug1 : Additive effect or potentiation 
. 
- drug1 and drug2 drug3 : drug4 and drug5 drug6 have the potential of binding drug7 and reducing drug8 absorption from the gastrointestinal tract 
. 
- drug1 , drug2 : Intensified electrolyte depletion , particularly hypokalemia 
. 
- Pressor amines ( e.g. , drug1 ) : Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use 
. 
- drug1 , nondepolarizing ( e.g. , drug2 ) : Possible increased responsiveness to the drug3 
. 
- drug1 : Generally should not be given with drug2 . 
drug1 reduce the renal clearance of drug2 and add a high risk of drug3 toxicity . 
Refer to the package insert for drug1 preparations before use of such preparations with drug2 
. 
- drug1 : In some patients , the administration of a drug2 can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of drug3 , drug4 and drug5 . 
Therefore , when drug1 and drug2 are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the drug3 is obtained 
. 
- Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions : drug1 should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function . 
Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with drug1 ( drug2 ) given with drug3 or drug4 - drug5 combination products . 
For patients receiving drug1 , see CONTRAINDICATIONS . 
drug1 ( e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) and drug5 may reduce the therapeutic effects of drug6 . 
In addition , the beneficial effects of drug1 in Parkinsons disease have been reported to be reversed by drug2 and drug3 . 
Patients taking these drugs with drug1 and drug2 or drug3 - drug4 combination products should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response . 
drug1 salts may reduce the bioavailability of drug2 and drug3 . 
The clinical relevance is unclear . 
Although drug1 may increase the bioavailability of drug2 by increasing gastric emptying , drug3 may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties . 
Drugs that may increase drug1 plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors : drug2 is a CYP3A4 substrate . 
Concomitant use of drug1 and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 ( eg , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ) may increase exposure to drug13 and should be avoided . 
In patients receiving treatment with drug1 , close monitoring for toxicity and a drug2 dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor can not be avoided . 
Drugs that may decrease drug1 plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers : Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease drug2 plasma concentrations . 
In patients in whom CYP3A4 inducers ( eg , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ) are indicated , alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be used . 
If drug1 must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer , a dose increase in drug2 should be considered . 
St. Johns wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) may decrease drug1 plasma concentrations unpredictably . 
Patients receiving drug1 should not take St. Johns wort . 
drug1 : Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of drug2 is pH dependent . 
Simultaneous administration of drug1 with drug2 should be avoided . 
If drug1 therapy is needed , the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of drug2 . 
drug1 / drug2 : Long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by drug3 or drug4 ( eg , drug5 and drug6 ) is likely to reduce drug7 exposure . 
The concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 with drug3 is not recommended . 
The use of drug1 should be considered in place of drug2 or drug3 in patients receiving drug4 therapy . 
Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by drug1 CYP3A4 Substrates : drug2 is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 . 
Therefore , CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , or drug11 ( drug12 , drug13 ) should be administered with caution in patients receiving drug14 . 
Hepatic Impairment There are currently no clinical studies with drug1 in patients with impaired liver function ( clinical studies have excluded patients with ALT and/or AST 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range and/or total bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of the normal range ) . 
Metabolism of drug1 is mainly hepatic . 
Caution is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment . 
Renal Impairment There are currently no clinical studies with drug1 in patients with impaired renal function ( clinical studies have excluded patients with serum creatinine concentration 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range ) . 
drug1 and its metabolites are minimally excreted via the kidney . 
Since the renal excretion of unchanged drug1 and its metabolites is 4 % , a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal insufficiency . 
Drug interaction studies have not been performed with drug1 . 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed . 
No confirmed interactions have been reported between drug1 and other drugs 
drug1 Inhalation Aerosol has been used concomitantly with other drugs , including drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 , commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 
With the exception of drug1 , there are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of drug2 Inhalation Aerosol and these drugs with respect to effectiveness . 
drug1 : Although drug2 is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation , there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used drug3 . 
Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of drug1 Inhalation Aerosol with other drug2 - containing drugs . 
Concomitant treatment with drug1 ( eg , rt-PA or drug2 ) may : - increase the risk of bleeding complications - considerably enhance the effect of drug3 on aPTT prolongation 
Concomitant treatment with drug1 ( drug2 ) and drugs that affect platelet function may also increase the risk of bleeding . 
Co-administration of drug1 at steady-state with a single dose of drug2 . 
Co-administration of drug1 at steady-state with a single dose of drug2 ( 2 x 600 mg tablets ) results in increased drug3 serum concentrations . 
Although a dose adjustment of drug1 is not recommended when administered in combination with drug2 , close monitoring for known side effects of drug3 , such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment , is warranted . 
drug1 did not affect the prothrombin time response to a single dose of drug2 . 
However , prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with drug1 and drug2 concomitantly . 
Concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 in clinical practice has been associated with increased anticoagulant effects . 
Drug interaction studies were performed with drug1 and other drugs likely to be co-administered . 
When used in therapeutic doses , drug1 had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ( intravenous and oral ) , drug13 , drug14 / drug15 or drug16 . 
Co-administration with drug1 or drug2 had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 
No dosage adjustment of either drug is recommended when drug1 is co administered with any of the above agents . 
Interactions with the drugs listed below have not been reported in clinical trials with drug1 ; 
however , no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction . 
Nonetheless , they have been observed with drug1 . 
Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when drug1 and these drugs are used concomitantly , careful monitoring of patients is advised : drug2 elevated drug3 concentrations . 
drug1 or drug2 acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia . 
drug1 , drug2 and drug3 concentrations . 
Laboratory Test Interactions There are no reported laboratory test interactions . 
Repeat Treatment Studies evaluating the use of repeated courses of drug1 have not been conducted . 
Oral drug1 : drug2 appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors . 
If oral drug1 are also being given , compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired . 
Patients stabilized on oral drug1 who are found to require drug2 replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started . 
If a patient is truly hypothyroid , it is likely that a reduction in drug1 dosage will be required . 
No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug1 or Oral drug2 : Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in drug3 or oral drug4 requirements . 
The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of drug1 and endocrine status of the patient . 
Patients receiving drug1 or oral drug2 should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy . 
drug1 : drug2 binds both drug3 and drug4 in the intestine , thus impairing absorption of these drug5 . 
In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed . 
Therefore , 4 to 5 hours should elapse between administration of drug1 and drug2 . 
drug1 , Oral drug2 : drug3 tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin ( TBg ) . 
In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy , free drug1 may be decreased when drug2 are started thus increasing drug3 requirements . 
However , if the patients thyroid gland has sufficient function , the decreased free drug1 e will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine output by the thyroid . 
Therefore , patients without a functioning drug1 gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if drug2 or drug3 - containing oral drug4 are given . 
drug1 : Use of drug2 with drug3 and other drug4 may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed . 
drug1 activity may also be enhanced . 
drug1 : drug2 may potentiate the toxic effects of drug3 . 
Thyroid hormonal replacement increases metabolic rate , which requires an increase in drug1 dosage . 
drug1 : When administered to patients on a drug2 , this parenteral drug3 may cause hypertension and tachycardia . 
Use with caution and be prepared to treat hypertension , if necessary . 
drug1 s : drug2 increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as drug3 and drug4 . 
Therefore , injection of these agents into patients receiving drug1 increases the risk of precipitating coronary insufficiency especially in patients with coronary artery disease . 
Careful observation is required . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The following drugs or moieties are known to interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on drug1 therapy : drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , oral drug5 containing drug6 , drug7 - containing preparations and the numerous preparations containing drug8 . 
- Changes in TBg concentration should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of T4 and T3 values . 
In such cases , the unbound ( free ) hormone should be measured . 
Pregnancy drug1 and drug2 - containing oral drug3 increase TBg concentrations . 
TBg may also be increased during infectious hepatitis . 
Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis , acromegaly and after drug1 or drug2 therapy . 
Familial hyper - or hypo-thyroxine-binding-globulinemias have been described . 
The incidence of TBg deficiency approximates 1 in 9000 . 
The binding of thyroxine by thyroxine-binding prealbumin ( TBPA ) is inhibited by drug1 
. 
- Medicinal or dietary drug1 interferes with all in vivo tests of radio-iodine uptake producing low uptakes which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone synthesis 
. 
- The persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicates either poor patient compliance , poor absorption , excessive fecal loss , or inactivity of the preparation . 
Intracellular resistance to drug1 is quite rare . 
drug1 injection and drug2 should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias . 
The drugs may , however , be administered alternately provided a proper interval has elapsed between doses . 
drug1 should be used with caution , if at all , when potent inhalational drug2 such as drug3 are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of drug4 . 
Taking drug1 after drinking drug2 may worsen side effects and may cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse . 
In vitro mixing of an drug1 with beta-lactamtype drug2 ( drug3 or drug4 ) may result in a significant mutual inactivation . 
Even when an drug1 and a drug2 - type drug are administered separately by different routes , a reduction in drug3 serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function . 
Usually , such inactivation of the drug1 is clinically significant only in patients with severely impaired renal function . . 
See 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted . 
The effects of drug1 may be potentiated by drug2 which inhibits the metabolism of drug3 . 
The pressor effects of drug1 and other drug2 can combine to cause dangerous hypertension . 
Administration of 0.1-mg / kg ( 2 x ED95 ) drug1 at 10 % or 95 % recovery following an intubating dose of drug2 ( 1 mg/kg ) produced 95 % neuromuscular block . 
The time to onset of maximum block following drug1 is approximately 2 minutes faster with prior administration of drug2 . 
Prior administration of drug1 had no effect on the duration of neuromuscular block following initial or maintenance bolus doses of drug2 . 
Infusion requirements of drug1 in patients administered drug2 prior to infusions of drug3 were comparable to or slightly greater than when drug4 was not administered . 
The use of drug1 before drug2 to attenuate some of the side effects of drug3 has not been studied . 
Although not studied systematically in clinical trials , no drug interactions were observed when drug1 , drug2 , or drug3 were administered following varying degrees of recovery from single doses or infusions of drug4 . 
drug1 or drug2 administered with drug3 / drug4 to achieve 1.25 MAC [ Minimum Alveolar Concentration ] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of drug5 and decrease the required infusion rate of drug6 . 
The magnitude of these effects may depend on the duration of administration of the volatile agents . 
Fifteen to 30 minutes of exposure to 1.25 MAC drug1 or drug2 had minimal effects on the duration of action of initial doses of drug3 and therefore , no adjustment to the initial dose should be necessary when drug4 is administered shortly after initiation of volatile agents . 
In long surgical procedures during drug1 or drug2 anesthesia , less frequent maintenance dosing , lower maintenance doses , or reduced infusion rates of drug3 may be necessary . 
The average infusion rate requirement may be decreased by as much as 30 % to 40 % . 
In clinical studies drug1 had no effect on the duration of action or dosing requirements for drug2 . 
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of drug1 such as drug2 include certain drug3 ( e. g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 ) , drug12 salts , drug13 , local drug14 , drug15 , and drug16 . 
Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of drug1 has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered drug2 or drug3 . 
While the effects of chronic drug1 or drug2 therapy on the action of drug3 are unknown , slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher . 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None known . 
The effects of concomitant drug1 administration on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug2 . 
drug1 ( ' drug2 ' ) is a newly introduced drug3 with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . 
It is extensively metabolized , predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4 . 
Therefore , concurrent administration of drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme may affect drug1 pharmacokinetics . 
This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer drug1 did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of drug2 , resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , or bipolar disorder . 
These results indicate that dosage adjustment of drug1 may be necessary when the two drugs are given concurrently and that caution may be required when administering other drugs that inhibit or induce cytochromes , particularly P450 3A4 . 
[ Drug treatment of erection disorders in patients with cardiovascular disease ] Erectile dysfunction is a frequent condition in cardiovascular patients . 
Since the arrival of oral drug1 , patients want to know how safe sexual activity is in cardiovascular disease in general and during use of drug2 in particular . 
Sexual intercourse with a steady partner causes no more cardiovascular risk than normal daily activities such as ironing , 2 kilometers of walking without climbing , paperhanging , playing golf or gardening . 
The relative risk of myocardial infarction during sexual activity is not significantly higher than for healthy persons . 
The incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is not higher among users of drug1 . 
drug1 is contraindicated in patients using drug2 or who may need to use drug3 , because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure . 
No interactions have been observed with drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 and drug5 . 
Before prescribing a symptomatic ( pharmaceutical ) treatment for patients with an erection disorder , attention should be given tot the sexological , psychological and medical backgrounds of the disorder . 
Secondary prevention of atherosclerotic risk factors is also important : regulation of blood pressure and blood sugar level , hyperlipidaemia and obesity , as well as a change of lifestyle ( giving up smoking , adapting of diet and more physical exertion ) . 
Patients with a very low cardiac capacity should be advised to refrain from treatment of the erection disorder . 
Failure of drug1 to modify drug2 induced hypertension in sheep . 
Studies in rats have shown that drug1 administration attenuates certain types of drug2 dependent hypertension , including drug3 hypertension . 
The effects of oral drug1 on drug2 induced hypertension were examined in conscious sheep . 
drug1 has no effect on the blood pressure or metabolic responses to drug2 in sheep . 
Pharmacokinetic Interaction between drug1 and drug2 or drug3 in healthy males . 
The objective of this study was to determine if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction when drug1 is given with drug2 or drug3 and to determine the effects of these drugs on the erythromycin breath test ( ERMBT ) . 
Twenty-four healthy male subjects were randomized to one of two cohorts . 
All subjects received drug1 ( 1,200 mg twice a day ) for 4 days , followed by a 7-day washout period , followed by either drug2 ( 300 mg once a day [ QD ] ) ( cohort 1 ) or drug3 ( 600 mg QD ) ( cohort 2 ) for 14 days . 
Cohort 1 then received drug1 plus drug2 for 10 days , and cohort 2 received drug3 plus drug4 for 4 days . 
Serial plasma and urine samples for measurement of drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 and their drug4 , were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography . 
drug1 did not significantly affect drug2 's pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state ( AUC ( ss ) ) of drug2 by 2.93-fold and the AUC ( ss ) of drug3 by 13.3-fold . 
drug1 significantly decreased the AUC ( ss ) of drug2 by 82 % , but drug3 had no effect on drug4 pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 decreased the results of the ERMBT by 83 % . 
The results of the ERMBT after 2 weeks of drug1 and drug2 therapy were increased 187 and 156 % , respectively . 
drug1 plus drug2 was well tolerated . 
drug1 plus drug2 was poorly tolerated , and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy . 
drug1 markedly increases the metabolic clearance of drug2 , and coadministration is contraindicated . 
drug1 significantly decreases clearance of drug2 and drug3 , and the combination is poorly tolerated . 
drug1 inhibits the ERMBT , and drug2 and drug3 are equipotent inducers of the ERMBT . 
[ The effect of drug1 on the activity of mixed-function mono-oxidases in the liver microsomes ] The effects of the drug2 -- the drug drug3 -- on hepatic microsomal monooxygenase activities were studied . 
The agent was found to produce some inhibiting activity against hepatic microsomal 7-ethoxycoumarine deethylase in male Wistar rats in vitro and in vivo experiments . 
When given in a dose of 50 mg/kg , drug1 produced no statistically significant effect on the duration of hexanal-induced sleep in mice . 
The findings suggest that the agent has slight effects on the tested activities . 
Repeated oral administration of drug1 in sheep : interactions of drug2 with drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
Interactions between treatments with drug1 , drug2 ( an drug3 ) , drug4 ( an drug5 ) , and drug6 ( an inducer of microsomal enzymes ) were investigated in sheep . 
A daily dose of 2 mg of drug1 / kg of body weight for 6 days did not affect the plasma enzymes or the antiprothrombinemic effect of drug2 in wethers . 
The treatment of ewes with an intravenous ( IV ) injection of drug1 , insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity , appeared to produce additive effects with those produced by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of drug2 / kg/day . 
In ewes given 40 mg of drug1 / kg for 5 days intraperitoneally ( IP ) , the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of drug2 / kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present . 
Treatment with daily doses of 2 mg of drug1 / kg for 6 days did not modify the anticholinesterase effect of a 2nd series of treatments given 6 weeks later . 
Pharmacokinetic profile of drug1 in special populations . 
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 in healthy normal volunteers has been extensively studied and is well described . 
drug1 is characterised by a high oral bioavailability , low clearance , a small volume of distribution , and a 7-hour half-life . 
It is essentially completely metabolised , therefore little is excreted unchanged . 
drug1 is highly protein bound . 
To investigate the effect of disease states or concomitant drug administration on a patient 's response to drug1 , additional pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in special populations . 
Since drug1 has a well-defined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship , measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters is clinically relevant . 
Data from studies to date show that disease states , underlying conditions , and concomitantly administered highly protein-bound drugs have essentially no effect on drug1 pharmacokinetics . 
Therefore , drug1 can generally be given without the need for dosage modifications in special populations such as uncompromised elderly patients , those with moderate renal impairment , and patients with stable hepatic disease . 
Enhanced drug1 clearance secondary to drug2 therapy . 
This report describes two cases in which drug1 clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant drug2 administration . 
Maximum calculated drug1 clearance ranged from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 times baseline . 
Onset of the interaction began within five days of beginning concurrent therapy . 
With combined use , clinicians should be aware , when drug1 is added , of the potential for reexacerbation of pulmonary symptomatology due to lowered serum drug2 concentrations . 
In vitro activity of drug1 , either singly or in combination with drug2 , against Mycobacterium ulcerans . 
The antimicrobial effect of a drug1 , drug2 , either alone or in combination with drug3 , was evaluated in vitro against two type strains and six clinical isolates of Mycobacterium ulcerans . 
Growth of M. 
ulcerans was measured by plate counts and the BACTEC radiometric method . 
The minimal inhibitory concentration as well as minimal bactericidal concentration of drug1 against M. 
ulcerans was between 0.012 and 0.025 mg/l , while corresponding values for drug1 and drug2 were in the range of 0.1-0 .8 mg/l and 0.1-0 .4 mg/l respectively . 
When combined with drug1 , drug2 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of drug3 ( or drug4 ) and drug5 . 
These results suggest that drug1 has a great potential in the treatment of M. 
ulcerans infection . 
Pharmacokinetics of drug1 . 
Effective use of drugs in therapy depends not only on clinical acumen but also on the availability of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data . 
Such information assists in development of safe dosing regimens , prediction of abnormal handling of drugs in states of disease and disorder and anticipation of drug interactions . 
For the drug1 now available in the United States ( drug2 , drug3 and drug4 ) , these data appeared well after clinical patterns of use evolved . 
Nonetheless , their relevance continues to be demonstrated by the dependence of each agent on intact liver blood flow and function for normal rates of elimination ; 
by the nonlinear kinetic characteristics for drug1 and drug2 ( and probably for drug3 , as well ) and the derivative implications for decreased dosing frequency requirements ; 
and by observations now appearing on the relation between plasma drug levels and drug effects , both therapeutic and toxic . 
Such data are discussed herein , with emphasis on those aspects that impact on the clinical use of the drug1 . 
Herbal remedies , nephropathies , and renal disease . 
The use of herbal remedies is becoming increasingly popular in the United States . 
Research has shown that herbal remedy use may be associated with acute renal failure . 
In addition , the use of herbal remedies may be detrimental for the patient with compromised renal function . 
Patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure may be at risk for further kidney damage as well as complications related to interactions of herbal remedies with complex renal therapy regimens . 
This article will describe the escalating use of herbal therapy and the hazards of herbal remedy use among patients . 
drug1 and their complications . 
Drugs that suppress the immune system are widely used . 
They are part of the treatment of patients with organ transplants , malignancy , and increasingly those with conditions such as psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , and liver and bowel disease in which inflammation is an aetiological factor . 
Because of the broadening indications for drug1 , and the prolonged survival in conditions for which they are being used , many patients on immunosuppression are now cared for in the community or seen in non-specialist hospitals , usually in close collaboration with a specialist . 
This article looks at five commonly used drug1 in turn ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) , discussing the main , non-infection , unwanted effects , ways to avoid them and what to do if problems arise . 
The management of infection is dealt with as a separate section . 
drug1 and drug2 similarly inhibit and stimulate drug3 - or drug4 - induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium . 
Prostatic epithelium proliferates in a defined medium consisting of basal medium RPMI1640 containing drug1 ( 1 microgram/ml ) , drug2 ( 10 ng/ml ) , and drug3 ( 3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 IU/ml ) . 
Although neither drug1 nor drug2 affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing drug3 alone , they modify the mitogenic effect of drug4 and drug5 . 
drug1 at 10 ( -10 ) M or drug2 at about 3 X 10 ( -9 ) M inhibits proliferation stimulated by drug3 . 
Higher concentrations of drug1 ( 10 ( -8 ) - 10 ( -6 ) M ) or drug2 ( 3 X 10 ( -8 ) - 10 ( -7 ) M ) enhance the mitogenic activity of drug3 . 
drug1 had a similar effect in the presence of drug2 . 
However , drug1 stimulated , but did not significantly inhibit , proliferation in the presence of drug2 . 
These results suggest that both drug1 and drug2 , and possibly other drug3 and drug4 , may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of drug5 and drug6 . 
Death in drug1 users : causes and rates . 
The world medical literature contains 43 reports of deaths associated with drug1 in a 35-year period . 
These included seven cerebrovascular accidents , six sudden cardiac deaths , three cases of hyperpyrexia , eight poisonings of uncertain mechanism and seven cases of medical complications of intravenous injection ; 
the remainder were of uncertain cause . 
In contrast , in Ontario alone , in 1972 and 1973 there were 26 deaths in drug1 users , of which 16 were due to accident suicide or homicide . 
Of the remaining cases , two were cardiac , two hepatic and the rest were mixed drug overdose . 
Pulmonary granulomata , subacute hepatitis and other lesions resulting from intravenous drug use were common findings at autopsy . 
On the basis of the estimated number of regular users of intravenous drug1 in Ontario , the mortality rate in such users is at least four times as high as in the general population of the same age , and is comparable to that in alcoholics and drug2 addicts . 
However , the absolute number of drug1 - related deaths is far greater than the number of deaths in drug2 or drug3 users . 
[ A pharmacological analysis of the effect of drug1 on stimulated gastric secretion ] Chronic experiments on dogs with gastric fistulas were carried out to study the influence of drug2 and drug3 on drug4 - and drug5 - induced gastric acid secretion . 
It was established that both angiotensins inhibited gastric acid secretion stimulated by drug1 but not by drug2 . 
Comparative analysis of the effects of stimulation and inhibition of cholino - and adrenoreceptors on this inhibitory action of drug1 suggested the mediation of drug2 influence through the modulation of cholinergic reactions of parietal cells in the stomach . 
[ Stimulation by drug1 -- an analog of the octapeptide cholecystokinin -- of drug2 binding after the long-term administration of drug3 ] It has been established in experiments on white male rats that prolonged administration ( twice a day for 14 days ) of drug4 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) and drug5 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) resulted in the reduced interaction between drug6 and low affinity binding sites for drug7 in subcortical structures , whereas drug8 binding with high affinity binding sites for drug9 increased both in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures of the forebrain . 
After prolonged administration of drug1 the displacing effect of drug2 , an analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide , was replaced by the stimulant action on drug3 binding . 
It is assumed that increased interaction between drug1 and high affinity binding sites for drug2 on dopamine2 - and serotonin2-receptors underlies the antipsychotic action of drug3 after their prolonged administration . 
Cholecystokinin octapeptide is a necessary factor for realization of this action of drug1 . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in rats . 
The interaction of intramuscularly injected drug1 and its N-demethylated metabolite ( metabolite I ) with drug2 was evaluated in rats . 
Five , 10 , 20 , or 50 mg/kg of drug1 alone or 20 , 50 , or 100 mg/kg of metabolite I alone produced less than 10 minutes of hypnosis . 
However , drug1 anesthetic requirement ( i.e. , MAC ) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56 % 1-2 hours and as much as 14 % 5-6 hours after injection of drug2 , 50 mg/kg , im . 
The reduction in MAC was correlated with brain levels of drug1 or metabolite I , suggesting a drug2 : metabolite I potency ration of 3:1 . 
The half-life of drug1 in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of drug2 than when drug3 was given alone . 
It is concluded that drug1 is not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with drug2 would be expected to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system . 
In vitro interaction of drug1 and drug2 in placental vessels . 
The interaction of drug1 and synthetic drug2 on placental vessels was studied in vitro . 
Resistance was measured near the placental margin after spontaneous term delivery . 
In seven experiments reactions to drug1 and drug2 were drug3 . 
drug1 produced significantly increased vasoconstriction after a single administration of drug2 . 
In eight experiments the perfusion medium contained drug1 . 
There was no change after a single dose of drug1 . 
The reaction after drug1 remained the same in both groups of experiments . 
There is thus an enhancement effect 
There is thus an enhancement effect of drug1 upon the reaction of placental vessels to drug2 in vitro . 
Note : dissolution of aerosol particles of drug1 in drug2 , a model drug3 . 
The effect of a drug1 extract from bovine lung , drug2 , on the dissolution rate of aerosol particles of drug3 was determined . 
Aerosol particles of drug1 were generated from an drug2 solution , dried , and collected by a cascade impactor for characterization or by a liquid impinger for dissolution experiments . 
Powder x-ray diffraction , differential scanning calorimetry , differential thermal analysis , and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the aerosol particles and starting material . 
No change in phase was detected , although the aerosol particles appeared to contain residual drug1 . 
The dissolution rate of the aerosol particles in saline was low and variable . 
drug1 increased the extent of dissolution of drug2 in proportion to the added concentration , which was also verified by equilibrium solubilization studies . 
drug1 also increased rate of dissolution , in a manner similar to drug2 . 
Analysis of the concentration of drug1 following ultracentrifugation indicated that there is rapid equilibration of drug2 between the drug3 and aqueous phase . 
These results show that drug1 has the potential of enhancing the rate and extent of dissolution of drugs administered to the lung . 
Anaesthesia and the epileptic pateint . 
A review . 
A review is presented of some of the problems that may arise in association with anaesthesia for epileptic patients . 
There is the possibility of precipitating anticonvulsant drug toxicity . 
Numerous drug interactions are possible with some drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , which affect hepatic microsomal enzyme systems . 
There is the risk of convulsions occurring in susceptible patients following the use of the new drug1 which are capable of inducing CNS excitability . 
Interaction between drug1 and drug2 in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryos . 
In this study we investigated whether also drug1 fulfils the function as co-activator in glutamatergic activation of NMDA receptors in the neuronal apparatus of spontaneous motility in chick embryos . 
The successive application of drug1 ( 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight ( e.w. ) 
and drug1 ( 15 mg/kg e.w. ) 
The successive application of drug1 ( 5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight ( e.w. ) and drug2 ( 15 mg/kg e.w. ) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of drug3 alone . 
This effect did not depend on the order of application of the drugs . 
In 13-day-old embryos , drug1 was ineffective in both doses . 
It is concluded from these results that the modulatory effect of drug1 is evidently a later developmental acquisition ( after day 15 of incubation ) in the embryogenesis of NMDA-ergic activation of spontaneous motility in chick embryos similarly as glycinergic inhibition . 
Acute effect of different drug1 on glycemia in diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
Diabetic patients have a 20 % higher risk of depression than the general population . 
Treatment with drug1 can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with drug2 . 
The treatment of depression in diabetic patients must take into account variations of glycemic levels at different times and a comparison of the available drug1 is important . 
In the present study we evaluated the interference of drug1 with blood glucose levels of diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
In a first experiment , male adult Wistar rats were fasted for 12 h. 
drug1 ( 5 mg/kg ) , drug2 ( 30 mg/kg ) , drug3 ( 0.25 mg/kg ) , drug4 ( 20 mg/kg ) drug5 ( 30 mg/kg ) or vehicle was administered . 
After 30 min , fasting glycemia was measured . 
An oral drug1 overload of 1 ml of a 50 % drug2 solution was given to rats and blood glucose was determined after 30 , 60 and 90 min . 
drug1 and drug2 did not change fasting or overload glycemia . 
drug1 and drug2 increased blood drug3 at different times after the glucose overload . 
drug1 neutralized the increase of glycemia induced by oral drug2 overload . 
In the second experiment , non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were fasted , and the same procedures were followed for estimation of drug1 tolerance 30 min after drug2 overload . 
Again , drug1 neutralized the increase in glycemia after drug2 overload both in diabetic and non-diabetic rats . 
These data raise the question of whether drug1 is the best choice for prolonged use for diabetic individuals , because of its antihyperglycemic effects . 
drug1 would be useful in cases with potential risk of hypoglycemia . 
drug1 promotes the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the microsomal fraction of rat liver and it enhances the effects of oleate in this respect . 
drug1 ( 0.5-2 mM ) promoted the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction in a cell-free system derived from rat liver . 
By contrast , drug1 ( 1 mM ) and drug2 ( 1 mM ) had no significant effect on the translocation when added alone . 
drug1 , and to a lesser extent , drug2 , enhanced the translocating action of oleate and increased its effectiveness in transferring the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction . 
It is proposed that the phosphohydrolase becomes metabolically active when it combines with membranes and that polyamines might help to regulate this interaction . 
This could facilitate the action of fatty acids and enable cells to increase their capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis to match an increased availability of fatty acids . 
The effects of drug1 and of drug2 anesthesia on drug3 tolerance in dogs . 
In a comparison of drug1 tolerance in dogs anesthetized with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 , the dosage of drug5 needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher , as was the LD50 of drug6 , with drug7 or drug8 than with drug9 . 
Ventricular tachycardia induced by drug1 was generally converted to sinus rhythm following administration of drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 but not after administration of drug5 alone or after drug6 . 
Excretion of thioethers in urine after exposure to electrophilic chemicals . 
Electrophilic agents -- a class of chemicals that includes most genotoxic compounds -- can be inactivated by reaction with glutathione or other SH-bearing molecules . 
The conjugates so formed often appear in the urine as mercapturic acids or other thioether products . 
This paper critically reviews the suitability of the urinary thioether assay as a method for the detection of exposure to electrophilic agents or their precursors . 
In practice , the greatest value of the thioether assay appears to lie in its signal function . 
This is demonstrated for cigarette smokers and industrial workers involved in chemical waste incineration . 
Whenever increased thioether excretion is observed , it is likely to be due to exposure to one or more suspect compounds . 
However , when the thioether concentration ranges within the limits of the normal value , one must not conclude that there is no , or negligible , exposure . 
More specific applications of the assay of thio compounds in urine allow development of selective methods that may be useful for biological monitoring . 
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to a drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of rhabdomyolysis resulting from concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 . 
CASE SUMMARY : A 64-year-old African-American man was admitted to the hospital for worsening renal failure , elevated creatine phosphokinase , diffuse muscle pain , and severe muscle weakness . 
About three weeks prior to admission , the patient was started on drug1 for sinusitis . 
The patient had been receiving drug1 for approximately six months . 
He was treated aggressively with intravenous hydration , drug1 , and hemodialysis . 
A muscle biopsy revealed necrotizing myopathy secondary to a toxin . 
The patient continued to receive intermittent hemodialysis until his death from infectious complications that occurred three months after admission . 
There were several factors that could have increased his risk for developing rhabdomyolysis , including chronic renal failure . 
DISCUSSION : drug1 is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , the major enzyme responsible for drug2 metabolism . 
The concomitant administration of drug1 and other drug2 have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis . 
Other factors may increase the risk of this drug interaction , including the administration of other medications that are associated with myopathy , underlying renal insufficiency , and administration of high doses of drug1 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 inhibit the metabolism of drug2 that are metabolized by CYP3A4 ( i.e. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ) . 
This interaction may result in myopathy and rhabdomyolysis , particularly in patients with renal insufficiency or those who are concurrently taking medications associated with myopathy . 
Optimal designs for the individual and joint exposure general logistic regression models . 
Interest in administering compounds in combination lies both in enhancing efficacious effects and in limiting adverse effects . 
Although much statistical work has focused on developing mathematical functions to model the joint dose-response curves , relatively little work exists in regard to designing experiments for assessing joint action . 
A variety of parametric dose-response models based on either the normal or logistic probability distribution have been proposed in the literature . 
These models are typically nonlinear in the parameters , and as such , a nonlinear weighted least squares approach can be employed for the purpose of designing experiments . 
The approach is applicable across a wide variety of settings commonly associated with joint action data , including continuous and discrete responses , alternative error structures , and nonzero background response . 
Further , designs can be expressed in terms of proportionate responses associated with the individual compounds rather than dose levels , thereby providing for results that are applicable across compounds . 
As a precursor to this effort , optimal and minimal experimental designs for the case in which a single compound is administered have also been developed . 
Although the proposed methodology for deriving experimental designs can be applied to any nonlinear regression model , primary focus is given to the additive and nonadditive independent joint action ( IJA ) models for individual and combined exposures proposed by Barton , Braunberg , and Friedman ( 1 ) . 
[ The GABA-ergic system and brain edema ] It has been shown in rats with experimental toxic and traumatic edemas that drug1 ( 1 mg/kg ) removes the antiedematous action of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 and reduces the action of drug6 . 
When the dose of drug1 is minimized to 0.5 mg/kg such an effect is not observed . 
Prolonged daily administration of drug1 in a dose of 1 mg/kg results in the development of brain edema . 
It is recommended that GABA-positive drugs be included into a complex of treatment measures for edema . 
New oral therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus : The drug1 or insulin sensitizers . 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a growing problem not only in the United States but also across the world . 
There is now strong evidence that intensive control of blood glucose can significantly reduce and retard the microvascular complications of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy . 
Ultimately however , up to 80 % of type 2 diabetics die from macrovascular cardiovascular disease . 
This increased incidence of atherosclerotic disease is intricately associated with insulin resistance , which is a major pathophysiologic abnormality in type 2 diabetes . 
There is strong evidence that insulin resistance is involved in the development of not only hyperglycemia , but also dyslipidemia , hypertension , hypercoagulation , vasculopathy , and ultimately atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . 
This cluster of metabolic abnormalities has been termed the insulin resistance or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
The drug1 ( drug2 and drug3 ) , a new class of oral drug4 , are `` insulin sensitizers '' 
and exert direct effects on the mechanisms of insulin resistance . 
These effects not only improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control with reduced insulin requirements , but also have potentially favorable effects on other components of the cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome . 
Long-term studies are needed to determine whether the insulin-sensitizing effects of the drug1 can prevent or delay premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , morbidity , and death . 
Effect of drug1 on the apparent volume of distribution and elimination of drug2 . 
According to Gibaldi et al. . 
( 1968 , 1970 ) , the higher serum concentrations of drug1 and drug2 reached after administration of drug3 are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body . 
To determine whether drug1 has a direct effect on the distribution of drug2 , the elimination and distribution of drug3 was studied in six patients , five lacking kidney function and one with a partially impaired renal function , in the presence or absence of drug4 . 
No significant difference was found between the mean values of the volume of distribution of drug1 with and without drug2 ( 13.0 and 12.6 liters , respectively ) . 
Thus , the hypothesis of Gibaldi et al. . 
could not be confirmed for drug1 in patients lacking kidney function . 
In spite of the absence of kidney function , the value of the elimination rate constant was significantly decreased in the presence of drug1 ( from 0.326 to 0.263 / h ) . 
This might be explained by a blockade by drug1 of the elimination of drug2 by the liver . 
Stereoselective behavioral effects of drug1 in pigeons and squirrel monkeys . 
The behavioral effects of the stereoisomers of drug1 ( drug2 ) were compared with those of drug3 ( drug4 ) in pigeons and squirrel monkeys responding under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio ( FI FR ) schedule of food presentation . 
Intermediate doses of drug1 or drug2 produced transient increases in FI responding in monkeys and sustained increases in FI responding in pigeons ; 
higher doses decreased FI and FR responding in both species . 
In contrast to its enantiomer , drug1 failed to increase FI responding significantly in either species ; 
at high doses , drug1 decreased FI and FR responding . 
In monkeys , drug1 was about 10 times more potent than drug2 in decreasing responding , whereas in pigeons drug3 was about equipotent with drug4 . 
In both species , drug1 , but not drug2 , antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of drug3 on FI and FR responding . 
In monkeys , the effects of drug1 , but not drug2 or drug3 , were antagonized by drug4 ; 
the doses of drug1 required to antagonize the effects of drug2 were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of drug3 . 
In pigeons , drug1 did not systematically alter the effects of drug2 , drug3 or drug4 . 
drug1 reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either drug2 or drug3 in pigeons , but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of drug4 . 
The results demonstrate a high degree of stereoselectivity in the behavioral effects of drug1 . 
The levorotatory isomer had opioid-antagonist and non-opioid agonist effects in pigeons and mixed opioid agonist-antagonist effects in monkeys . 
The dextrorotatory isomer , on the other hand , had effects similar to those of drug1 in both species . 
Cancer in the elderly : basic science and clinical aspects . 
The incidence of cancer increases progressively with age . 
Rearrangements of genomes have been found to accompany cellular aging . 
These factors , in concert with age-dependent alterations in immune function and host defense , may help to explain the increased risk of malignant disease in aged persons . 
The clinical presentation and natural history of neoplasia are also affected by aging . 
This conference reviews recent developments in these areas , examines the effects of drug use in the elderly and implications for management , and discusses current information on how age may influence the response of cancer to therapy . 
Prescribing . 
Keys to maximizing benefit while avoiding adverse drug effects . 
When prescribing for older patients , some physicians are overly cautious , and this strategy can result in a less than optimal treatment outcome . 
The reluctance to treat aggressively is understandable because the geriatric population is susceptible to adverse drug reactions . 
The key to maximizing therapy lies in individualizing it as much as possible . 
There are a number of steps physicians can take to ensure that their patients are not being undertreated . 
These steps include regular reevaluations of dosages and plasma drug concentrations , recognition and understanding of drug side effects , and avoidance of certain agents . 
Close monitoring allows physicians to minimize risks , maximize benefits , and get the most out of what modern medications can do to help older patients . 
Determinants of cellular sensitivity to drug1 . 
It is now clear that topoisomerase activity level is an important determinant of sensitivity to topo drugs . 
The regulation of topoisomerases is no doubt complex and multifaceted and is probably accomplished through redundancy at many control levels . 
The mechanism ( s ) of altered topo I expression in certain tumor types is unknown , but may be related to the central importance of topoisomerases in proliferating cell functions ( transcription , replication , etc. ) , and the aberrant and chronic activation of these functions as a result of specific tumorigenic alterations . 
Small differences in sensitivity to chemotherapy can have a dramatic effect on cure rates , and therefore subtle cell type-specific differences may be important determinants of drug sensitivity . 
Whether abnormal topoisomerase quantity and specific activity are associated with resistance or sensitivity to topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy in the clinic is now being studied . 
Determinants downstream of cleavable complex formation that affect the sensitivity of tumor versus normal cells to topo drugs in particular and DNA-damaging agents in general are little known . 
The goal of enhancing selective tumor cell killing relative to the normal cells that are dose limiting may be achieved either by overcoming tumor cell resistance or by protecting normal cells . 
Both of these strategies will become more feasible as specific molecular differences between tumor and normal cells are being rapidly identified and new combination therapies that take advantage of these differences are being designed and tested . 
Interactions of drug1 and drug2 in absorption and retention . 
The effects of supplementary oral drug1 and drug2 , as well as the interaction between both at the absorption site , fecal and urinary excretion as well as the retention of these trace elements were determined by using four diets containing either 9 or 63 micrograms/kg of drug3 and 48 or 446 mg/kg of drug4 over a period of 19 days in a total of 24 rats . 
Retention was calculated by the balance technique and by the comparative slaughter technique . 
After one day , fecal as well as urinary excretion of both elements had already responded to the dietary treatments , with constant values being reached after approximately three days . 
drug1 excretion was enhanced by supplementary drug2 ; 
fecal excretion , too , was increased by supplementary drug1 ; 
whereas urinary excretion was decreased in both cases . 
Additional drug1 significantly inhibited the absorption of drug2 in both dietary drug3 treatments . 
The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg drug1 instead of 48 mg of drug2 per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of drug3 . 
Consequently , the effect of drug1 on the retention of drug2 was lower than on absorption . 
This suggests that interactions between the two elements only take place at the site of absorption . 
Because of the low dietary drug1 concentration as compared to the drug2 contents of the diets , no effect of drug3 on drug4 absorption and excretion occurred . 
Differences in drug1 balance were only observed between both dietary concentrations , showing a higher absolute but a lower relative absorption as well as retention in the groups fed further drug2 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) 
[ Importance of pharmacogenetics ] Pharmacogenetics deals with the differences in effect of drugs caused by genetic variation . 
Differences can occur in therapeutic effect and in adverse events . 
Genetic variation in metabolism may result in high concentrations of drugs and an increased risk of adverse effects in slow metabolizers , which is important when using for example drug1 or chemotherapy . 
Genetic variation also occurs in proteins interacting with drugs , which may change the effect of e.g. 
asthma drugs and drug1 . 
The selection of drugs and their dosages may be improved , and the number of adverse effects reduced by pharmacogenetic investigations . 
However , it may be important also in case of medical examinations for insurances and job appointments , since some patients may turn out to need expensive drugs or to be susceptible to a certain disease . 
Therefore , the use of genetic data in these instances has to be regulated . 
drug1 overdose recognized by a drug2 assay . 
Altered mental status in an adolescent presents a diagnostic challenge , and the clinician depends on clinical evaluation and laboratory studies to determine therapy and prognosis . 
We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by drug1 overdose with a positive drug2 level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of drug3 with a toxicology screen for drug4 . 
drug1 . 
Treatment plans for patients taking drug1 can become complicated . 
drug1 predispose a patient to bleeding problems . 
Many drugs used in dentistry can not be taken concomitantly with these medications . 
Acute drug1 administration does not affect subjective responses to drug2 in humans . 
RATIONALE : Stress and drug1 facilitate and reinstate psychostimulant self-administration in rodents . 
However , the effects of stress and drug1 on the subjective and behavioral effects of drug2 have not been well studied in humans . 
OBJECTIVES : To examine the effects of acute drug1 pretreatment on the subjective and behavioral effects of drug2 . 
METHODS : drug1 ( 100 mg ) and drug2 ( 20 mg ) were administered orally to 16 healthy male and female volunteers in a four-session , placebo-controlled , within-subject , crossover design . 
To prevent stomach irritation , subjects received drug1 before each experimental session . 
Dependent measures included self-reported mood and subjective effects ( Addiction Research Center inventory , the profile of mood states , and a series of visual analogue scales ) , vital signs , salivary cortisol , and psychomotor performance . 
RESULTS : drug1 elevated salivary cortisol levels , produced modest dysphoria , and reduced subjects ' reports of wanting more drug . 
However , drug1 pretreatment did not affect any of the physiological , behavioral , or subjective effects of drug2 . 
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the effects of drug1 in rodent studies , these results indicate that an acute increase in cortisol does not enhance the psychostimulant effects of drug2 in humans . 
Effect of drug1 on drug2 - induced changes in steroid hormone levels and lethality in male rats . 
We examined the effect of exogenous drug1 on the changes in serum steroid hormone levels induced by a nonlethal dose of Escherichia coli drug2 in male rats and the deaths due to nonlethal and lethal doses of drug3 . 
Injection of drug1 5 min before a nonlethal dose of drug2 changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to drug3 . 
The serum estrogen concentrations of drug1 + drug2 - treated rats decreased by 50 % , while those of the drug3 - treated rats increased ( 2 - to 5-fold ) . 
The serum androgen concentrations of drug1 + drug2 - treated rats did not change significantly , while those of drug3 - treated rats dropped to 30-40 % 
0.001 . 
Exogenous drug1 also appeared to influence the percentage of drug2 - induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner . 
It reduced the number of deaths induced by nonlethal ( 2 mg/kg ) dose of drug1 but increased the number of deaths induced by a highly lethal dose ( 8 mg/kg ) . 
These results , together with the known relationships between drug1 and the immune response , suggest that drug2 affect the course of septic shock in a complex fashion and may have either protective or deleterious effect . 
Studies on the mechanism of action of drug1 : effect of drug2 on respiration and cell permeability of Candida albicans . 
The drug1 , drug2 , inhibits the growth of several species of Candida . 
Candida albicans , one of the pathogenic species , was totally inhibited at a concentration of approximately 10 mug/ml . 
Endogenous respiration was unaffected by the drug at a concentration as high as 100 mug/ml , whereas exogenous respiration was markedly sensitive and inhibited to an extent of 85 % . 
The permeability of the cell membrane was changed as evidenced by the leakage of 260-nm absorbing materials , amino acids , proteins , and inorganic cations . 
The results we present clearly show that the drug alters the cellular permeability , and thus the exogenous respiration becomes sensitive to the drug . 
Interferon induction : tool for establishing interactions among homopolyribonucleotides . 
Hitherto unrecognized interactions between homopolyribonucleotides and complexes thereof are suggested by interferon induction data obtained in a highly sensitive assay system of primary rabbit kidney cell cultures superinduced by metabolic inhibitors . 
drug1 : a therapeutic update . 
BACKGROUND : Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998 , drug1 has been used by millions of men for the treatment of erectile dysfunction . 
Recent studies and consensus reports have expanded our understanding of its efficacy , safety , contraindications , and drug interactions . 
OBJECTIVE : This paper reviews recent studies of the efficacy of drug1 , its adverse effects and drug interactions , and socioeconomic factors involved in its use , with a focus on specific patient populations ( prostate cancer , diabetes mellitus , ischemic heart disease , spinal cord injuries , neurologic disorders ) . 
METHODS : Clinical studies , case reports , and commentaries and editorials concerning drug1 published in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE , PREMEDLINE , and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts , using the terms drug2 , drug3 , and erectile dysfunction . 
RESULTS : drug1 has demonstrated effectiveness in men with erectile dysfunction associated with prostatectomy , radiation therapy , diabetes mellitus , certain neurologic disorders , and drug therapy ( eg , drug2 [ drug3 ] ) . 
It has not been as effective in women with sexual dysfunction , with the exception of drug1 - associated sexual dysfunction . 
Some disorders unrelated to sexual dysfunction ( eg , esophageal motility dysfunction ) may also respond to drug1 . 
In the general population , drug1 is considered to have an acceptable tolerability profile ; 
however , patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking drug1 therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with drug2 therapy . 
In addition , patients taking drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme , which metabolizes drug1 , may experience increased drug concentrations and possible toxicity from normal doses of drug2 . 
CONCLUSIONS : drug1 is an effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in men . 
The decision to prescribe this agent should include such considerations as the cost-risk-benefit balance , patient access , drug distribution pathways , and prescription drug coverage . 
Tumor phenotype and susceptibility to progression as an expression of subpopulations of initiated murine cells . 
Currently , it is conceived that a number of events , or hits , are required for the induction of tumors by chemical agents . 
The first phase of this sequence , initiation , is considered to result from at least one event in the genetic apparatus . 
Analyses of this sequence , however , usually give little consideration to the nature of the target cell or to the characteristics of the resultant tumors . 
Vesselinovitch et al. . 
( Cancer Res. , 38 : 2003-2010 , 1978 ) have reported that a single , small pulse of carcinogen can induce early and numerous liver tumors when administered neonatally to mice with a genetic predisposition to hepatotumorigenesis . 
In the current study , the nonpredisposed strain C57BL/6N was also shown to be highly susceptible to diethylnitrosamine during the neonatal period . 
C57BL/6N demonstrated large numbers of two of the three types of liver tumors seen in livers of genetically predisposed mice , one of which required the additional stimulus of dietary drug1 for growth . 
Tumors of more malignant phenotype were demonstrated only in genetically predisposed mice ( C57BL/6N X C3H/HeN F1 ) that received one dose of carcinogen . 
These findings suggest that the phenotype of a tumor that results from a pulse of a chemical carcinogen may depend upon the target cell . 
The initiated cells that result from this hit may vary from those that demonstrate very little progression in cell type and may or may not require exogenous enhancement of growth to those that can progress very rapidly to fully malignant behavior . 
The latter might arise from a hit in a genetically initiated cell , the result of which is a more rapid progression in tumor type . 
Effects of drug1 upon the metabolism of chylomicron-like emulsions in patients with coronary artery disease . 
Slow chylomicron intravascular catabolism has been associated with coronary artery disease and screening for drugs that can speed-up this process can be important . 
In this study , the effects of drug1 upon chylomicron metabolism was tested by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 12 patients with coronary artery disease , aged 59 + / -11 years , ( total cholesterol : 240 + / -41 mg/dl ; triglycerides : 188 + / -42 mg/dl ) submitted to a randomized , crossover , double-blind , placebo-controlled study with administration of 1 g per day drug2 or placebo for 1-month . 
A 1-month washout period was inserted between the treatment periods . 
Patients were intravenously injected a chylomicron-like emulsion doubly labeled with 14C-cholesteryl oleate and 3H-triolein at baseline and after treatments . 
After drug1 treatment , there was decrease of total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels and a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma levels . 
drug1 elicited 62 % enhancement of post - drug2 lipolytic activity and 100 % increase of 3H-triglyceride fractional clearance rate compared with placebo treatment . 
14C-cholesterol ester fractional clearance rate was 260 % greater after drug1 than after placebo . 
Therefore , a potent effect of drug1 on both chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal was achieved , indicating that this drug can be used to improve this metabolism in future prospective studies . 
Selective survival in drug1 and drug2 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O11 from drug addicts . 
The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , particularly serotype O11 , in drug1 and drug2 
was evaluated as a possible explanation for the association of deep-seated infection with this organism and abuse of these drugs . 
The mean reduction of growth caused by the drugs was 1,000-fold greater for 49 Pseudomonas strains from normal subjects than for 32 strains from drug addicts ( 4.2 vs. 1.3 logs of reduction at 2 hr , P less than .0005 ) . 
A common phenotypic subset of the serotype O11 strains from drug addicts was especially resistant to the inhibitory effects . 
Twelve strains of Staphylococcus aureus ( a frequent cause of infection in drug1 , but not in drug2 and drug3 , addicts ) were completely inhibited by the drug combination . 
Dose-response curves ( derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders ) showed that drug1 was responsible for the inhibitory activity , which was partially antagonized by drug2 . 
We conclude that an ability of some P. 
aeruginosa serotype O11 strains , but not S. 
aureus , to survive in drug1 and drug2 may explain in part a shift from S. 
aureus to P. 
aeruginosa as common pathogens of drug addicts in areas where abuse of this combination of drugs has increased . 
Influence of coadministration of drug1 on drug2 pharmacokinetics and QTc intervals in healthy volunteers . 
STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of drug1 on the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular safety of drug2 at steady state in healthy men . 
DESIGN : Open-label , three-phase , sequential study . 
SETTING : Clinical research center . 
SUBJECTS : Twelve healthy male volunteers . 
INTERVENTIONS : Each subject was treated according to the following sequence : baseline ; 
phase 1 ( days 1-6 ) : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ; 
washout ( days 7-13 ) ; 
phase 2 ( days 14-44 ) : drug1 20 mg/day ; 
and phase 3 ( days 45-52 ) : drug1 10 mg 4 times/day ( days 45-51 ) plus drug2 20 mg/day ( days 45-52 ) . 
MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS : Blood samples were drawn and 12-lead electrocardiograms performed at specified time points after the last morning dose of drug1 in phases 1 and 3 . 
Blood samples also were taken before morning doses on the 3rd , 4th , and 5th days of phases 1 and 3 . 
Electrocardiograms were done at baseline and on the last day of the washout period and phase 2 . 
Coadministration of drug1 significantly decreased drug2 plasma concentrations . 
There were no clinically significant changes in corrected QT intervals during administration of drug1 alone or with drug2 . 
drug1 was well tolerated when administered alone or with drug2 . 
CONCLUSION : drug1 can be administered safely to patients receiving low therapeutic dosages of drug2 . 
Activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 against Cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture . 
The in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity of drug1 alone and in combination with drug2 and drug3 was investigated . 
drug1 showed moderate activity , which increased with increasing concentration to 55.7 % suppression of growth at 20 microM . 
Moreover , its activity was enhanced when it was combined with either drug1 or drug2 with 90 % parasite reduction at the highest concentration tested . 
drug1 may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either drug2 or drug3 . 
Modification of surface histidine residues abolishes the cytotoxic activity of drug1 . 
drug1 displays both cytotoxic and enterotoxic activities . 
It has recently been demonstrated that drug1 exerts its cytotoxic effect by the glucosylation of the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family . 
drug1 , at pH 7.0 , was used to chemically modify exposed histidine residues on drug2 . 
Modification of drug1 with drug2 abolished both its cytotoxic activity and the ability of the toxin to bind Zn-Sepharose gel . 
Treatment of drug1 with [ ( 14 ) C ] - drug2 revealed concentration dependent labelling of histidine residues on the toxin molecules . 
The effects of drug1 could be reversed by drug2 treatment . 
These data suggest the modified histidine residues on drug1 are critical to its cytotoxic activity . 
Histidine modification had no effect on the glucosyl transferase enzyme activity of drug1 . 
However , modification abolished the ` cold ' binding of toxin to bovine thyroglobulin in an ELISA and reduced ligand binding activity in a rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination assay . 
The data suggest that the histidine residues may be crucial to the receptor-binding activity of drug1 . 
Exposed histidines on drug1 are available for drug2 chelation , and these have been exploited in the development of a novel purification protocol for drug3 using drug4 - chelating chromatography . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 in vitro . 
The minimal inhibitory concentrations of drug1 and drug2 alone and in combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic , facultative , and anaerobic clinical isolates . 
All 77 strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Diplococcus pneumoniae , Streptococcus pyogenes , and anaerobic bacteria ( except for three strains of Clostridium ) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
drug1 did not interfere with the activity of drug2 within the range of concentrations tested ( 0.1 to 100 mug/ml ) ; 
for some strains combinations were synergistic . 
Sixty-two ( 94 % ) of 66 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of drug1 per ml . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains . 
All 20 strains of enterococcus , three strains of Clostridium , three strains of Escherichia coli , and one strain of Proteus rettgeri were resistant to both drug1 ( minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml ) and drug2 ( minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml ) . 
Combinations of drug1 and drug2 were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains . 
Except for drug1 - sensitive isolates , synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo . 
Antagonism was never observed . 
drug1 and the common cold . 
Evaluation of its efficacy and toxicity . 
We reviewed the clinical data relating to the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic doses of drug1 in the prevention and treatment of the common cold . 
Although one study tentatively supports the hypothesis that such doses of drug1 may be efficacious , a second study by the same group did not confirm the significant findings , and no clear , reproducible pattern of efficacy has emerged from the review of all the evidence . 
Similarly , there is currently little adequate evidence on either the presence or the absence of serious adverse reactions to such doses of drug1 , although many such reactions have been hypothesized . 
The unrestricted use of drug1 for these purposes can not be advocated on the basis of the evidence currently available . 
Effects of drug1 in a light/dark test in mice and the contribution of adenosine receptors . 
We investigated the effects of adenosine receptor antagonists , drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ( drug5 ) , in a light/dark test in mice . 
All antagonists decreased the time spent in the light zone in this test , which suggested that these compounds have anxiogenic effects . 
The anxiogenic effects of drug1 were reduced by pretreatment with drug2 , an A2-selective agonist , but not by drug3 ( drug4 ) , an A1-selective agonist . 
However , the antagonism of the drug1 - induced anxiogenic effects by drug2 was only observed in the time spent in the light zone , and drug3 - induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by drug4 nor by drug5 . 
Finally , it is notable that xanthine-derived adenosine antagonists tested here commonly showed anxiogenic effects in the light/dark test in mice . 
It is suggested that there is a minor contribution of adenosine receptors to these effects , although drug1 - induced anxiogenic effects were antagonized by an A2 receptor agonist . 
Restoration of drug1 susceptibility in Enterococcus faecalis by antiresistance determinant gene transfer . 
We assessed the ability of gene transfer to reverse drug1 resistance in class A ( VanA ) glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecalis . 
Recombinant shuttle vectors containing a vanH promoter-vanA antisense gene cassette fully restored drug1 susceptibility through a combined transcriptional activator binding domain decoy and inducible vanA antisense RNA effect . 
Induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to drug1 and drug2 . 
1 , drug1 ( drug2 ) , the active metabolite of drug3 , is a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro . 
We have shown that MCF-7 cells treated with 100 nM drug1 exhibit characteristic apoptotic morphology ( pyknotic nuclei , chromatin and cytoplasmic condensation , nuclear matrix protein reorganization ) within 48 h . 
In the experiments reported here , we examined the interactions between drug1 and the drug2 drug3 ( drug4 ) , which also induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells . 
Our data suggest that drug1 significantly potentiates the reduction in cell number induced by drug2 alone . 
Combined treatment with drug1 and drug2 enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation . 
We have selected a subclone of MCF-7 cells resistant to drug1 ( MCF-7D3Res ) . 
These cells express the vitamin D receptor and exhibit doubling times comparable to the parental MCF-7 cells , even when grown in 100 mM drug1 . 
Treatment of both parental and resistant MCF-7 cells with drug1 induces apoptosis and clusterin . 
These data emphasize that apoptosis can be induced in MCF-7 cells either by activation of drug1 - mediated signalling or disruption of drug2 - dependent signalling . 
Cholinergic role in drug1 's effects on evoked potentials in visual cortex of the albino rat . 
Photic evoked potentials were recorded from the visual cortex of chronically implanted albino rats . 
Since photic evoked potential components are representations of neural pathways which are activated during photic stimulation , study of the effects of drug1 on these components may help to trace pathways which are affected by drug2 . 
In the present study , evoked potentials were recorded at 5 , 20 , and 40 min following IP injections of saline , drug1 ( 2.0 g/kg ) , drug2 ( 0.6 mg/kg ) or drug3 ( 15.0 mg/kg ) on separate days . 
drug1 depressed the amplitudes of most evoked potential components in comparison to saline administration . 
Component P2 , however , was increased in amplitude . 
drug1 briefly reduced the amplitude of most components , including P2 . 
In contrast , drug1 increased the amplitudes of components P1 and P2 , while decreasing components N1 , N2 and N3 for varying durations of time . 
drug1 pretreatment augmented the depressant effect of drug2 on the early components P1 and N1 , while attenuating drug3 's influence on components P2 and P3 . 
Pretreatment with drug1 likewise further reduced the amplitudes of components P1 and N1 , and produced a similar effect on component N3 . 
drug1 , either alone or in combination with drug2 , produced approximately the same degree of enhancement of component P2 . 
In comparison to saline values , all three agents produced reliable increases in peak latency for most of the components , with only N3 showing no effects . 
The amplitude data from this study suggest that drug1 's augmentation of component P2 may result , at least in part , from alterations in cholinergic functions . 
Increased hepatotoxicity of drug1 by concomitant administration of drug2 in the rat . 
Since drug1 is frequently co-administered with drug2 , it is of clinical interest to study the effect of drug3 on the hepatotoxicity of drug4 . 
In male Sprague-Dawley rats fasted for 18 h , concomitant administration of drug1 ( 0.1 g/kg , i.p. ) 
as judged by increased serum enzyme activities and increased incidence of hepatic necrosis . 
Careful observations on hepatotoxicity are suggested when drug1 is prescribed with drug2 . 
Dual effect of drug1 on the drug2 - induced contraction and norepinephrine release in the guinea-pig vas deferens . 
drug1 ( drug2 ) , C129H223N3O54 , isolated from marine coelenterates of Palythoa tuberculosa , caused a first rapid contraction followed by the slow phasic contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens . 
In the presence of drug1 ( 10 ( -5 ) M ) , drug2 ( 10 ( -8 ) M ) failed to cause the first contraction ; 
however , the second contraction was potentiated . 
In the presence of drug1 ( 10 ( -6 ) M ) , the second contraction was inhibited selectively . 
When drug1 was applied to the muscle in the presence of drug2 , both first and second contractile responses to drug3 were abolished . 
When the muscle was exposed to the potassium-depleted solution , the first contractile response to drug1 was rather potentiated . 
drug1 caused the release of norepinephrine from the muscle . 
Exposure of the muscle to drug1 ( 10 ( -5 ) M ) markedly increased the drug2 - induced release . 
It is indicated that the first and second contractile responses to drug1 have entirely different properties . 
The second response is due to a release of norepinephrine from nerves and was potentiated by drug1 through the increase in the norepinephrine release , whereas the first response was not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and was inhibited by drug2 . 
The mechanism of the action of drug1 was discussed in the relation with Na,K-ATPase . 
Analgesic effects of drug1 . 
The literature provides considerable evidence indicating that several , but not all drug1 , are indeed drug2 and some are drug3 as well . 
Those for which effectiveness is reported includes drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 
The proposed mechanisms of analgesic action of drug1 are reviewed and discussed . 
The literature suggests that more than one mechanism of action exists for them . 
There is considerable evidence suggesting that histaminergic and serotoninergic central pathways are involved in nociception and that drug1 drugs can modulate their responses ( 1 ) . 
The evidence for a role for norepinephrine and dopamine and the effects of drug1 on them are less well established . 
Still other pathways have been proposed . 
A greater understanding of pain mechanisms will aid in elucidating the role of drug1 in analgesia . 
Effect of drug1 on voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes in bovine chromaffin cells . 
In previous reports we have shown that drug1 inhibit high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) channels in neuronal cells . 
However , these studies did not show whether drug1 - induced inhibition of Ca ( 2 + ) currents discriminates among the various Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes , although it is known that there are at least five different Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes in neuronal cells . 
In this study we investigated the effect of drug1 on high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) channel subtypes using their drug2 drug3 ( L-type ) , drug4 ( N-type ) , or drug5 ( P-type ) in bovine chromaffin cells . 
We could observe that drug1 inhibited high threshold voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) currents in a dose-dependent manner . 
The IC ( 50 ) was about 120 microgram/ml . 
drug1 had no effect on drug2 response . 
These data suggest that drug1 are negatively coupled to three types of calcium channels in bovine chromaffin cell , including an drug2 - sensitive ( N-type ) channel , an drug3 - sensitive ( P-type ) channel and drug4 / drug5 / drug6 - resistant ( presumptive Q-type ) channel . 
Thus , the selective regulation of voltage-dependent Ca ( 2 + ) subtypes by drug1 in bovine chromaffin cell could be the cellular basis of antistress effects induced by drug2 . 
A proposed mechanism for the potentiation of cAMP-mediated acid secretion by drug1 . 
Acid secretion in isolated rabbit gastric glands was monitored by the accumulation of [ ( 14 ) C ] drug1 . 
Stimulation of the glands with drug1 synergistically augmented the response to dibutyryl cAMP . 
The augmentation persisted even after drug1 was washed out and was resistant to chelated extracellular Ca ( 2 + ) and to inhibitors of either protein kinase C or calmodulin kinase II . 
drug1 at 10 microM preferentially blocked the secretory effect of drug2 and its synergism with cAMP , whereas it had no effect on histamine - or cAMP-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min . 
drug1 inhibited the drug2 - stimulated intracellular Ca ( 2 + ) concentration ( [ Ca ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) ) increase due to release from the Ca ( 2 + ) store . 
Treatment of the glands with drug1 redistributed type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor ( the major subtype in the parietal cell ) from the fraction containing membranes of large size to the microsomal fraction , suggesting a dissociation of the store from the plasma membrane . 
These findings suggest that intracellular Ca ( 2 + ) release by cholinergic stimulation is critical for determining synergism with cAMP in parietal cell activation and that functional coupling between the Ca ( 2 + ) store and the receptor is maintained by actin microfilaments .
