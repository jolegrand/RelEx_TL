the biotransformation and oxidative stress may contribute to 0-diepoxybutane -lrb- deb -rrb- -induced toxicity to human lymphocyte of fanconi anemia -lrb- fa -rrb- patient . 
thus , the identification of putative inhibitor of bioactivation , as well as the determination of the protective role of oxidant defense , on deb-induced toxicity , can help to understand what be fail in fa cell . 
in the present work we study the contribution of several biochemical pathway for deb-induced acute toxicity in human lymphocyte suspension , by use inhibitor of epoxide hydrolases , inhibitor of protective enzyme as glutathione s-transferase and catalase , the depletion of glutathione -lrb- gsh -rrb- , and the inhibition of protein synthesis ; 
and a variety of putative protective compound , include antioxidant , and mitochondrial protective agent . 
the present study report #crd# novel finding : -lrb- i -rrb- it be clearly evidence , for the #ord# time , that the acute exposure of freshly isolate human lymphocyte to deb result in severe gsh depletion and loss of atp , followed by cell death ; 
-lrb- ii -rrb- drug0 elicit a significant protective effect on deb induced toxicity , which be potentiate by drug0 . 
collectively , these finding contribute to increase our knowledge of deb-induce toxicity and will be very useful when apply in study with lymphocyte from fa patient , in order to find out a protective agent against spontaneous and deb-induced chromosome instability . 
metabotropic glutamate receptor 0 antagonist protect dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuron from degeneration in drug0 -treated monkey . 
degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and of noradrenergic neuron in the locus coeruleus be important pathological feature of parkinson 's disease . 
there be an urgent need to develop therapy that slow down the progression of neurodegeneration in parkinson 's disease . 
in the present study , we test whether the highly specific metabotropic glutamate receptor 0 antagonist , drug0 , reduce dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss in monkey render parkinsonian by chronic treatment with low dose of drug0 . 
weekly intramuscular drug0 injection -lrb- 0 mg/kg body weight -rrb- , in combination with daily administration of drug0 or vehicle , be performed until the development of parkinsonian motor symptom in either of the #crd# experimental group -lrb- drug0 / drug0 versus drug0 /vehicle -rrb- . 
after 0 week of drug0 treatment , all drug0 /vehicle-treated animal display parkinsonian symptom , whereas none of the drug0 / drug0 -treated monkey be significantly affect . 
these behavioural observation be consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter image datum , and with post-mortem stereological count of midbrain dopaminergic neuron , as well as striatal intensity measurement of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity , which be all significantly high in drug0 / drug0 -treated animal than in drug0 /vehicle-treated monkey . 
the drug0 treatment also have a significant effect on the drug0 -induced loss of norepinephrine neuron in the locus coeruleus and adjoining a0 and a0 noradrenaline cell group . 
in drug0 /vehicle-treated animal , almost 0 % loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neuron be find in locus coeruleus/a0/a0 noradrenaline cell group , whereas the extent of neuronal loss be low than 0 % of control value in drug0 / drug0 -treated monkey . 
our datum demonstrate that chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 0 antagonist , drug0 , significantly reduce drug0 toxicity towards dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell group in non-human primate . 
this suggest that the use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 0 antagonist may be a useful strategy to reduce degeneration of catecholaminergic neuron in parkinson 's disease .

synergistic interaction between drug0 and drug0 be sequence dependent in human non-small lung cancer with egfr tkis-resistant mutation . 
previous study have demonstrate that drug0 have the anti-tumor activity in human non-small cell lung cancer -lrb- nsclc -rrb- . 
this study be aim to investigate the efficacy of single use of drug0 and that of concurrent or sequential administration of drug0 and drug0 in nsclc cell line that be resistant to egfr tkis . 
nsclc cell line with egfr t0m mutation and k-ras mutation be expose to either drug0 or drug0 or both base on various sequential administration . 
after exposure , the cell viability be measure by mtt assay , cell cycle distribution be analyze by flow cytometry , and alteration in signaling pathway be determine by immunoblotting . 
drug0 exhibit dose-dependent growth inhibition in nsclc cell line and arrest cell cycle at g0 phase , whereas drug0 arrest at s phase . 
although single or concurrent use of drug0 and drug0 have some anti-proliferative effect , the sequential administration of both drug remarkably enhance anti-tumor activity . 
when cell be expose to drug0 followed by drug0 , synergism be observe . 
the molecular basis of this synergism be that the signaling pathway that be initially activate by drug0 exposure be efficiently suppress by the subsequent exposure to drug0 . 
in contrast , the reverse of this sequential administration result in antagonism , which may be due to differential effect on cell cycle arrest . 
drug0 as a single agent exhibit anti-proliferative effect in vitro in nsclc cell line with egfr t0m and k-ras mutation but the sequential administration of drug0 followed by drug0 be superior to drug0 followed by drug0 and concurrent administration .

alox0 be the most down-regulated gene -lrb- 0-fold -rrb- in sensitive cell and be express at low level in resistant cell . 
the result be corroborate by quantitative rt-pcr . 
western-blot analysis indicate alox0 be highly express only in sensitive cell line h0 and greatly decrease upon drug0 treatment . 
ectopic expression of alox0 reduce sensitivity to drug0 in h0 cell . 
furthermore , down-regulation of alox0 by rna interference could also induce apoptosis in h0 . 
gene expression analysis on mm patient dataset indicate alox0 expression be significantly high in mm patient compare to normal plasma cell . 
we also find that bcl-0 be overexpressed in drug0 insensitive cell , and cotreatment with drug0 and drug0 , a bcl-0 family inhibitor , synergistically inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of drug0 insensitive mm cell . 
take together , this study show #crd# of mechanism of the drug0 efficacy on mm correlate with its ability to down-regulate the alox0 level . 
in addition , drug0 insensitivity might be associate with overexpression of bcl-0 , and the combination of drug0 and drug0 could synergistically induce apoptosis . 
these result suggest that drug0 may be exploit therapeutically for a subset of mm .

drug0 failure in an hiv-positive woman on drug0 therapy result in #crd# ectopic pregnancy . 
since its introduction in 0 , drug0 remain #crd# of the preferred contraceptive choice for many woman as it offer a highly effective means of long-term contraception for #crd# year that do not rely on adherence . 
like all drug0 , certain hepatic enzyme-inducing drug may reduce its efficacy . 
we present an interesting case of an hiv-positive woman on drug0 therapy have tubal pregnancy on #crd# separate occasion with drug0 in place . 
drug0 and cyp 0d0 inhibitor : caution . 
drug0 , an drug0 , be the standard hormone treatment for breast cancer . 
it be extensively transform into its active metabolite by the cytochrome p0 enzyme system , especially into drug0 by isoenzyme cyp 0d0 . 
co-administration of drug0 with isoenzyme cyp 0d0 inhibitor reduce this metabolism . 
drug0 inhibit isoenzyme cyp 0d0 . 
drug0 and drug0 reduce the plasma concentration of drug0 by about 0 % . 
#crd# epidemiological study involve about 0 woman have show a link between the use of drug0 and an increase frequency of breast cancer recurrence . 
other study , with a low level of evidence , be less convincing . 
study of other isoenzyme cyp 0d0 inhibitor show no increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence , but they lack statistical power . 
it be well to avoid prescribing isoenzyme cyp 0d0 inhibitor to woman treat with drug0 for breast cancer , especially drug0 such as drug0 and drug0 . 
depression do not always require drug0 therapy , and drug0 have no proven preventive impact on hot flush link to the menopause . 
if in certain case , an drug0 be consider necessary , it may be advisable to replace drug0 with drug0 . 
phase i trial of drug0 and drug0 in patient with relapsed multiple myeloma : evidence for drug0 - drug0 interaction via p-glycoprotein . 
multiple myeloma -lrb- mm -rrb- be an incurable plasma-cell neoplasm for which most treatment involve a therapeutic agent combine with drug0 . 
the preclinical combination of drug0 with the mtor inhibitor drug0 have display synergy in vitro and represent a novel combination in mm . 
in vivo cyp0a activity be significantly low in drug0 -treated as compare with drug0 -treated renal allograft recipient . 
in vitro study have identify drug0 and drug0 as cyp0a inhibitor . 
in the current study in renal allograft recipient , we use intravenously and orally administer drug0 as a drug probe to assess whether the study drug at dose that be generally use in clinical practice have differential effect on in vivo hepatic and first-pass cyp0a activity . 
systemic and apparent oral drug0 clearance be 0 % -lrb- 0 0 vs. 0 0 ml/min , p = 0 -rrb- and 0 % -lrb- 0 0 vs. 0 0 ml/min , p = 0 -rrb- , respectively , low in drug0 -treated patient -lrb- n = 0 -rrb- than in matched drug0 -treated patient -lrb- n = 0 -rrb- . 
the latter display drug0 clearance similar to those in #crd# large cohort of nonmatched drug0 -treated patient -lrb- n = 0 and n = 0 -rrb- and to those receive a drug0 -free regimen -lrb- n = 0 -rrb- . 
this imply that in vivo hepatic and first-pass cyp0a activity be significantly low in patient receive drug0 than in those receive drug0 , indicate that , at the dose generally use in clinical practice , drug0 be the strong of the #crd# with respect to cyp0a inhibition . 
this observation have important implication in the context of drug-drug interaction in transplant recipient . 
-lsb-influence of drug0 and drug0 on mptp-evoked behavior violation in c0bl/0 mouse -rsb- . 
the effect of drug0 drug0 -lsb- drug0 -rsb- -lrb- 0 mg/kg , p. o . -rrb- 
and/or drug0 drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg , p. o. -rrb- , as well as that of neurotoxin drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- -lrb- 0 x 0 mg/kg , i. p . -rrb- 
be study in elevated plus maze test on c0bl/0 mouse . 
on #ord# day after injection , drug0 decrease the locomot or activity in comparison to saline . 
acute administration of drug0 or drug0 fail to influence locomotion in mouse , while their combination normalize motor activity . 
the result obtain confirm the role of inflammatory process in parkinsonism and suggest expediency of combined pharmacotherapy of neurodegenerative disease . 
exposure to oral drug0 be unaffected by drug0 but greatly increase by drug0 . 
this study examine drug-drug interaction of oral drug0 with the cytochrome p0 -lrb- cyp -rrb- 0b0 inhibitor drug0 and the cyp0a inhibitor drug0 . 
in this randomized , blinded , crossover study , 0 healthy volunteer ingest 0 mg/kg drug0 after pretreatment with oral drug0 -lrb- 0 mg twice daily -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg once daily -rrb- , or placebo in 0-day treatment period at interval of 0 week . 
drug0 treatment increase the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolate to infinity -lrb- auc -lrb- 0- -rrb- -rrb- of oral drug0 by 0-fold , whereas drug0 treatment do not increase the exposure to drug0 . 
the ratio of drug0 auc -lrb- 0- -rrb- to drug0 auc -lrb- 0- -rrb- be significantly decrease in the drug0 -lrb- p &amp ; lt ; 0 -rrb- drug0 zole phase -lrb- p = 0 -rrb- as compare to placebo . 
in the drug0 and drug0 phase , the area under the effect-time curve -lrb- self-reported drowsiness and performance -rrb- be significantly high than those in the placebo phase -lrb- p &lt ; 0 -rrb- . 
the finding suggest that the dosage of drug0 should be reduce in patient receive drug0 . 
interaction of drug0 with different drug0 be antagonistic in breast but not in other cancer cell . 
drug0 , an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-0 , be be investigate for enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy in cancer clinical trial . 
this study investigate the ability of drug0 to sensitize cell from different origin to several drug0 . 
the effect of the drug 's mechanism of action and sequence of administration be also investigate . 
the sensitivity , cell cycle , apoptosis and dna damage of #crd# different cancer cell line -lrb- hela , hct0 , hepg0 , mcf0 and u0 -rrb- to drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and drug0 drug0 following different incubation schedule be analyze . 
we find antagonism between drug0 and the #crd# drug in the breast cancer cell mcf0 follow all incubation schedule and between drug0 and drug0 in all cell line except for #crd# combination in hct0 cell . 
drug0 with the other #crd# drug in the remain #crd# cell line result in variable interaction . 
mechanistic investigation reveal that drug0 exert different molecular effect in different cell . 
in some line , it abrogate the drug-induced g0/m arrest enhance pre-mature entry into mitosis with damaged dna thus increase apoptosis and result in synergism . 
in other cell , it enhance drug-induced g0/m arrest allow time to repair drug-induced dna damage before entry into mitosis and decrease cell death result in antagonism . 
in some synergistic combination , celecoxib-induced abrogation of g0/m arrest be not associate with apoptosis but permanent arrest in g0 phase . 
these result , if confirm in-vivo , indicate that drug0 be not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with drug0 for other cancer . 
moreover , combination of drug0 with other drug should be tailor to the tumor type , drug and administration schedule . 
drug0 - drug0 interaction and associate gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case-control study . 
bleeding be the most common and worrisome adverse effect of drug0 therapy . 
#crd# of the factor that might increase bleeding risk be initiation of interacting drug that potentiate drug0 . 
we seek to evaluate whether initiation of an drug0 increase the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in drug0 user . 
medicaid claims datum -lrb- 0 -rrb- be use to perform an observational case-control study nest within person-time expose to drug0 in those 0 year . 
in total , 0 drug0 user contribute 0 person-years of drug0 use . 
the incidence rate of hospitalization for gi bleeding among drug0 user be 0 per 0 person-years -lrb- 0 % ci , 0 -rrb- . 
each gastrointestinal bleeding case be match to 0 control base on index date and state . 
drug0 user have an increase odds ratio of gastrointestinal bleeding upon initiation of drug0 -lrb- or = 0 -lsb-0 % ci , 0 -rsb- -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- or = 0 -lsb-0 % ci , 0 -rsb- -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- or = 0 -lsb-0 % ci , 0 -rsb- -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- or = 0 -lsb-0 % ci , 0 -rsb- -rrb- . 
also drug0 , which be not believe to interact with drug0 , increase the risk of gi bleeding -lrb- or = 0 -lsb-0 % ci , 0 -rsb- -rrb- . 
drug0 user who initiate drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 have an increase risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding . 
however , the elevated risk with drug0 suggest that a drug-drug interaction may not have be responsible for all of the observe increase risk . 
drug0 enhance the antinociceptive effect of drug0 in mouse . 
drug0 , a highly selective alpha-0-adrenoceptor agonist , be recently introduce into clinical practice for its sedative and analgesic property . 
the purpose of this study be to evaluate whether the psychostimulant drug drug0 have any effect on drug0 -induced antinociception and locomotor inhibitor activity in mouse in acute application . 
in both sex of swiss albino mouse ; 
antinociception be assess with hot-plate test and the locomotor , exploratory activity be assess with holed open field test . 
the animal be receive ; 
saline + saline , drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- + saline , saline + drug0 -lrb- 0 g/kg -rrb- and drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/kg -rrb- + drug0 -lrb- 0 g/kg -rrb- , intraperitoneally , 0 min before hot plate or holed open field test . 
in the hot plate test in mouse , co-administration of 0 g/kg drug0 with 0 mg/kg drug0 intraperitoneally not only enhance , but also prolong the duration of antinociception induce by drug0 . 
at the same time , the locomotor inhibitory effect of drug0 be counteract by drug0 . 
we conclude that the combined administration of drug0 with drug0 may have beneficial effect in the treatment of pain without cause sedation , which limit the use of drug0 as an drug0 in human . 
interaction study of drug0 and drug0 with co-administered drug . 
drug0 and drug0 be drug0 use in treat urinary and respiratory tract infection . 
drug0 be know to have interaction with drug that be active in gastro intestinal tract . 
be drug0 and lomefloxacin drug0 the interaction study of be carry out with drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and drug0 . 
the interaction be study at neutral , acidic and basic condition both at room temperature and 0 c . 
the effect of dissolution medium simulate various body environment with response to ph have be examine in order to elucidate the interaction . 
the response of drug0 and drug0 after interaction with co-administered drug at different condition and temperature be note use a shimadzu hplc system with pda detector . 
it be see that interaction of these drug0 be more at 0 c than at room temperature . 
drug0 and drug0 react fast with drug0 and drug0 in acidic medium whereas with drug0 in basic medium and drug0 in neutral medium . 
the study ensure the interaction of drug0 with select class of drug . 
in order to achieve the effective therapeutic effect appropriate time interval between administration of drug be essential .
