the effectiveness and safety of drug1 be similar between these patient and younger subject . 
Greater sensitivity of some older individual can not be rule out . 
interaction with drug1 : although drug2 do not itself cause orthostatic hypotension , its administration to patient already receive drug3 can result in profound orthostatic effect . 
if at all possible drug1 should be discontinue well before drug2 be begin . 
where this be not possible , drug1 therapy should be start in the hospital and the patient should remain institutionalized until severe orthostatic effect be no longer present or the patient have learn to avoid activity that provoke they . 
in a study in which 34 different drug be test , therapeutically relevant concentration of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 displace protein-bound drug4 in fresh human serum to a small but significant extent . 
because of the extremely high binding of drug1 to plasma protein , these small decrease in binding could cause substantial increase in free drug level in plasma which could result in potentiation of drug toxicity .

drug1 have no effect on the pharmacokinetic property of drug2 . 
drug1 decrease the elimination of drug2 cause a increase in overall exposure . the addition of drug3 have no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic property of drug4 . 
in a study of 11 hiv-infected patient receive drug1 - maintenance therapy -lrb- 40 mg and 90 mg daily -rrb- with 600 mg of drug2 twice daily -lrb- twice the currently recommend dose -rrb- , oral drug3 clearance increase 22 % -lrb- 90 % ci 6 % to 42 % -rrb- . 
this alteration will not result in a drug1 dose modification in the majority of patient ; 
however , a increase drug1 dose may be require in a small number of patient . 
other drug1 should not be use concomitantly with drug2 -lrb- drug3 usp -rrb- because they may have additive effect . 
drug1 should be administer with caution to patient be treat with drug2 or drug3 , since the action of drug4 on the vascular system may be potentiate . 
a study publish in 2002 find that drug1 cause a statistically significant increase in plasma clearance of drug2 . 
in 1984 , Drs Rimmer and Richens at the University of Wales report that administer drug1 with drug2 lower the serum drug3 concentration in patient with treatment-resistant epilepsy . 
the concentration of drug1 fall to 23 % within five week , accord to a experiment publish in 1989 by the same two scientist that try and fail to elucidate the mechanism behind this interaction .

in addition to bleeding associate with drug1 and drug2 , drug that alter platelet function -lrb- such as drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -rrb- may increase the risk of bleed if administer prior to or after drug6 therapy . 
the occurrence of stupor , muscular rigidity , severe agitation , and elevated temperature have be report in some patient receive the combination of drug1 and drug2 . 
symptom usually resolve over day when the combination be discontinue . 
this be typical of the interaction of drug1 and drug2 . 
other serious reaction -lrb- include severe agitation , hallucination , and death -rrb- have be report in patient receive this combination . 
severe toxicity have also be report in patient receive the combination of drug1 and drug2 and drug3 and drug4 . 
one case of hypertensive crisis have be report in a patient take the recommend dose of drug1 and a drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- . 
when drug1 and drug2 be use together , the sign of atropinization -lrb- flushing , mydriasis , tachycardia , dryness of the mouth and nose -rrb- may occur earlier than might be expect when drug3 be use alone . 
this be especially true if the total dose of drug1 have be large and the administration of drug2 have be delay . 
2 - 4 the follow precaution should be keep in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning , although they do not bear directly on the use of drug1 : since drug2 be potentiate by the drug3 , they should be use cautiously in the treatment of convulsion ; 
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 should be avoid in patient with organophosphate poisoning . 
no drug-drug interaction study have be conduct with drug1 . 
drug1 administer concomitantly with drug2 may significantly decrease the serum concentration of drug3 . 
laboratory test the pathologist should be advise of progestin therapy when relevant specimen be submit . 
the physician should be inform that certain endocrine and liver function test , and blood component may be affect by progestin therapy : -lrb- a -rrb- plasma and urinary steroid level be decrease -lrb- e.g. , progesterone , estradiol , pregnanediol , testosterone , cortisol -rrb- . 
-lrb- b -rrb- plasma and urinary gonadotropin level be decrease -lrb- e.g. , lh , fsh -rrb- . 
-lrb- c -rrb- shbg concentration be decrease . 
-lrb- d -rrb- t3-uptake value may decrease . 
-lrb- e -rrb- there may be small change in coagulation factor . 
-lrb- f -rrb- sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test value may be increase slightly . 
-lrb- g -rrb- there may be small change in lipid profile . 
in clinical study of drug1 , patient take drug2 concomitantly with drug3 -lrb- drug4 , Genentech -rrb- , drug5 , inhale drug6 , other drug7 , or parenteral drug8 demonstrate adverse experience profile similar to the study population as a whole . 
concurrent and/or sequential use of drug1 with other drug with neurotoxic or ototoxic potential should be avoid . 
some drug1 can enhance drug2 toxicity by alter drug3 concentration in serum and tissue . 
drug1 should not be administer concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
drug interaction there be no known drug/drug interaction with oral drug1 vaccination with drug2 be not recommend in immunocompromised individual drug3 together with high-dose intravenous drug4 have cause death in child due to haemorrhagic enterocolitis . 
impaired renal function have be describe in bone marrow transplant patient who be condition with high-dose intravenous drug1 and who subsequently receive drug2 to prevent graft-versus-host disease 
drug1 should be administer with caution to patient take drug2 because of the possibility of conduction disturbance . 
drug with parasympathomimetic effect administer concurrently with drug1 would be expect to result in additive pharmacologic effect . 
drug1 might antagonize the anticholinergic effect of drug use concomitantly . 
these effect should be consider when anticholinergic property may be contribute to the therapeutic effect of concomitant medication -lrb- e.g. , drug1 , inhale drug2 -rrb- . 
while no formal drug interaction study have be perform , the follow concomitant drug be use in at least 10 % of patient in either or both sj gren efficacy study : drug1 , artificial tear , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , and drug13 . 
the induction dose requirement of drug1 injectable emulsion may be reduce in patient with intramuscular or intravenous premedication , particularly with drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , etc. -rrb- 
and combination of drug1 and drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , etc. -rrb- . 
these agent may increase the anesthetic or sedative effect of drug1 injectable emulsion and may also result in more pronounced decrease in systolic , diastolic , and mean arterial pressure and cardiac output . 
during maintenance of anesthesia or sedation , the rate of drug1 injectable emulsion administration should be adjust accord to the desire level of anesthesia or sedation and may be reduce in the presence of supplemental drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 or drug4 -rrb- . 
the concurrent administration of potent inhalational agent -lrb- eg , drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 -rrb- during maintenance with drug4 injectable emulsion have not be extensively evaluate . 
these inhalational agent can also be expect to increase the anesthetic or sedative and cardiorespiratory effect of drug1 injectable emulsion . 
drug1 injectable emulsion do not cause a clinically significant change in onset , intensity , or duration of action of the commonly use drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 and drug4 -rrb- . 
no significant adverse interaction with commonly use premedication or drug use during anesthesia or sedation -lrb- include a range of drug1 , inhalational agent , drug2 , and local drug3 -rrb- have be observe . 
oral drug1 have be report to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of drug2 and drug3 , result in a prolongation of prothrombin time . 
drug interaction should be keep in mind when drug1 -lrb- drug2 gel -rrb- , 1 % be prescribe for patient who be receive anticoagulant treatment , although they be less likely to occur with topical drug3 administration because of low absorption . 
drug1 should be use with caution in patient on steroid therapy because of the potential for develop hypokalemia . 
caution be advise for patient receive high-dose drug1 and drug2 concomitantly , as anorexia , tachypnea , lethargy , coma and death have be report with concomitant use of high-dose drug3 and drug4 . 
drug1 may be use with drug2 , drug3 and other drug4 , and with other drug5 . 
if sign of folate deficiency develop , drug1 should be discontinue . 
drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- should be administer until normal hematopoiesis be restore . 
mild hepatotoxicity have be report in some patient when drug1 and drug2 be administer concomitantly . 
due to its effect on gastric emptying , drug1 therapy should not be consider for patient take drug that alter gastrointestinal motility -lrb- e.g. , drug2 such as drug3 -rrb- and agent that slow the intestinal absorption of nutrient -lrb- e.g. , drug4 -rrb- . 
patient use these drug have not be study in clinical trial . 
drug1 have the potential to delay the absorption of concomitantly administer oral medication . 
when the rapid onset of a concomitant orally administer agent be a critical determinant of effectiveness -lrb- such as drug1 -rrb- , the agent should be administer at least 1 hour prior to or 2 hour after drug2 injection . 
in clinical trial , the concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 do not alter the adverse event profile of drug3 . 
no formal interaction study have be perform to assess the effect of drug1 on the kinetics of oral drug2 . 
mix drug1 and drug2 the pharmacokinetic parameter of drug3 be alter when mix with regular , nph , and 70/30 premixed formulation of recombinant drug4 immediately prior to injection . 
thus , drug1 and drug2 should not be mixed and must be administer separately . 
since drug1 be a substrate for the metabolic pathway involve cyp2d6 and cyp1a2 enzyme , inhibition or induction of either of these enzyme would be expect to alter drug2 plasma concentration . 
in a formal , single-dose interaction study -lrb- n = 6 male -rrb- the clearance of drug1 be decrease by 38 % follow the coadministration of drug2 , a inhibitor of cyp1a2 . 
in another formal study -lrb- n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizer of cyp2d6 -rrb- , coadministration of drug1 do not alter the kinetics of drug2 in the poor cyp2d6 metabolizer group . 
however , the metabolic clearance of drug1 in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decrease by about 70 % make the poor and extensive metabolizer group indistinguishable . 
in this crossover steady state study , the pharmacokinetic of drug1 be unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of drug2 . 
addition of drug1 to drug2 do not lead to further electrocardiographic parameter change of QRS , QTc , RR , and pr interval than drug3 alone . 
when concomitant administration of either of these two drug with drug1 be initiate , the dose of drug2 should be slowly titrate to desire effect . 
in a large compassionate use program drug1 have be use concurrently with commonly employ antianginal , drug2 , and drug3 without observe interaction . 
a variety of drug1 such as drug2 or drug3 be also add , sometimes with improve control of ventricular ectopy . 
when drug1 or other hepatic enzyme inducer such as drug2 and drug3 have be take concurrently with drug4 , lower drug5 plasma level have be report . 
monitoring of drug1 plasma level be recommend during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy . 
in a formal study , drug1 be show not to affect drug2 plasma concentration . 
ecg interval -lrb- pr , QRS , and qt -rrb- be not affect by concurrent drug1 and drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 have be report to increase , decrease , or leave unchanged drug3 plasma level ; 
therefore patient should be follow carefully during concurrent therapy . 
drug1 do not alter serum drug2 level but drug3 , when use to treat gastrointestinal symptom due to drug4 , have be report to lower serum drug5 level . 
concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 may lead to increase plasma drug3 level . 
one controlled study in eight normal subject show a 72 % mean increase -lrb- range 35-136 % -rrb- in plasma drug1 level . 
this increase be observe at the first test point which be the second day after start drug1 . drug2 plasma level return to pre - drug3 value within 48 hour after discontinue drug4 . if drug5 and drug6 be to be use concurrently , drug7 blood level should be monitor , particularly when the drug8 dose be change . 
a appropriate adjustment in drug1 dose should be consider . 
additionally , in one controlled study in five normal subject and seven patient , the clearance of drug1 be decrease 50 % follow the administration of drug2 . 
drug1 -lrb- oral -rrb- : the activity of oral drug2 may be potentiate by anti-vitamin-k activity attribute to drug3 . 
- drug1 : hyperthyroidism may cause a increase clearance of beta ratio . 
a dose reduction of drug1 may be need when a hyperthyroid patient become euthyroid . 
drug1 : serum digitalis level may be increase when hyperthyroid patient on a stable drug2 regimen become euthyroid ; 
reduce dosage of drug1 may be require . 
drug1 : drug2 clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patient on a stable drug3 regimen become euthyroid ; 
a reduce dose of drug1 may be need . 
other drug1 should not be use concomitantly with drug2 because they may have additive effect . 
some drug1 may interact with drug2 . 
they can either increase or decrease the effect of drug1 . 
those drug1 include drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
drug1 may also affect the effect of other drug , which include some drug2 , drug3 , certain heart medicine , birth control pill , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 please note that drug7 may interact with other drug that be not list here . 
use with other drug1 : the depressant effect of drug2 be potentiate by the presence of other drug3 such as drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or drug7 . 
use of drug1 in conjunction with oral drug2 may increase the risk of respiratory depression , hypotension and profound sedation or coma . 
interaction with drug1 : drug2 -lrb- i.e. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 -rrb- should not be administer to patient who have receive or be receive a course of therapy with a proof drug7 . 
in these patient , the mixed agonist/antagonist may alter the analgesic effect or may precipitate withdrawal symptom . 
drug1 may decrease the hypotensive effect of drug2 . 
Use cautiously with pressor agent . 
human pharmacologic study have show that drug1 may inhibit the metabolism of drug2 , drug3 -lrb- drug4 , drug5 , drug6 -rrb- , drug7 , and drug8 -lrb- drug9 , drug10 , drug11 -rrb- . 
downward dosage adjustment of these drug may be require when give concomitantly with drug1 . 
serious adverse event have be report in concomitant use with drug1 , although no causality for the combination have be establish . 
the safety of use drug1 in combination with drug2 or other centrally act drug3 have not be systemically evaluate . 
co-administration of drug1 with strong inhibitor of the cyp3a4 family -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 -rrb- may increase drug13 concentration . 
grapefruit may also increase plasma concentration of drug1 . 
co-administration of drug1 with inducer of the cyp3a4 family -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , St. Johns Wort -rrb- may decrease drug9 concentration . 
St. 
Johns Wort may decrease drug1 plasma concentration unpredictably . 
patient receive drug1 should not take St. 
Johns Wort concomitantly . 
drug1 dose modification be recommend in patient use concomitant cyp3a4 inhibitor or inducer . 
drug1 : excessive reduction in blood pressure may occur in patient on diuretic therapy when drug2 be start . 
the possibility of hypotensive effect with drug1 can be minimize by discontinue diuretic therapy for several day or cautiously increase salt intake before initiation of treatment with drug2 . if this be not possible , the start dose of drug3 should be reduce . . 
drug1 supplement and drug2 : drug3 can increase serum potassium because it decrease aldosterone secretion . 
use of drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- or drug5 supplement concomitantly with drug6 can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . 
therefore , if concomitant use of such agent be indicate , they should be give with caution and the patient 's serum potassium should be monitor . 
oral drug1 : interaction study with drug2 fail to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentration of the drug3 or on its anticoagulant effect . 
drug1 : increase serum drug2 level and symptom of drug3 toxicity have be report in patient receive drug4 during therapy with drug5 . 
these drug should be coadminister with caution , and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 level be recommend . 
if a drug1 be also use , the risk of drug2 toxicity may be increase . 
other agent : no clinically important pharmacokinetic interaction occur when drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
drug1 have be use in clinical trial concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , oral drug6 , and cholesterol-lowering agent . 
there be no evidence of clinically important adverse interaction . 
drug1 be primarily eliminate unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion . 
concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drug could result in delay clearance of drug1 . 
concomitant administration of substance that be also tubularly secrete -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- could potentially result in delay clearance of drug2 . 
although drug1 -lrb- 400 mg qid -rrb- can be administer with drug2 in patient with normal renal function -lrb- creatinine clearance 80 ml/min -rrb- , caution should be use when administer drug3 concurrently with drug4 to patient with mild to moderate renal insufficiency -lrb- creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min -rrb- . 
patient with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should avoid take drug1 with short elimination half-life for a period of 2 day before , the day of , and 2 day follow administration of drug2 . 
in the absence of datum regard potential interaction between drug1 and drug2 with longer half-life , all patient take these drug3 should interrupt dosing for at least 5 day before , the day of , and 2 day follow drug4 administration . 
if concomitant administration of a drug1 be necessary , patient should be monitor closely for toxicity , especially myelosuppression , renal , and gastrointestinal toxicity . 
drug/laboratory test interaction none know . 
Prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitor if drug1 be administer with drug2 . 
concurrent use of drug1 with oral drug2 may render oral drug3 less effective . 
drug/laboratory test interaction there be no report drug-laboratory test interaction . 
drug1 may interact with the follow drug : drug2 and other drug3 -lrb- may lower drug4 level -rrb- , drug5 -lrb- bioavailability of oral drug6 be increase with coadministration -rrb- , drug7 -lrb- may decrease drug8 level -rrb- , drug9 -lrb- report of psychotic episode when coadminister -rrb- , drug10 -lrb- coadministration of drug11 with drug12 can inhibit ovarian function in woman -rrb- , drug13 and other sedate drug -lrb- may result in additive sedation and a increase incidence of adverse effect -rrb- , and drug14 -lrb- coadministration of drug15 and drug16 may interfere with the efficacy of the drug17 -rrb- . 
in vitro study with human liver microsome show that drug1 do not inhibit the metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 
in vitro study have also show that drug1 inhibit cyp2d6-mediated metabolism . 
this may be of clinical relevance for compound predominantly metabolize by this enzyme , such as drug1 , - blocker , drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , and drug4 , if they have a narrow therapeutic window . 
in vivo drug-drug interaction study conduct in normal volunteer subject show that drug1 do not affect the clearance of drug2 or drug3 . 
drug1 decrease the clearance of drug2 by 19 % . 
drug1 increase the clearance of drug2 by 15 % . 
there have be spontaneous report of increase or decrease in prothrombin time in patient concomitantly take oral drug1 and drug2 , however , a causal relationship between drug3 tablet and these change have not be establish . 
drug1 clearance be increase 100 % by drug2 , a cyp450 enzyme inducer , and decrease 33 % by drug3 , a cyp450 enzyme inhibitor . 
drug1 clearance be unaffected by drug2 . 
there be no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction study with the follow class of drug : oral drug1 , hormone replacement therapy , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 
drug1 may demonstrate additive toxicity when use in combination with other cytotoxic drug . 
drug1 have be report to prolong the elimination half-life of drug2 and may lead to severe bone marrow suppression ; 
a reduction of the drug1 dosage should be consider in patient receive drug2 concurrently . 
the concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 have be report in one case to result in reduce drug3 cytotoxicity . 
drug1 : drug2 cause a 60 % reduction in the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of drug3 and should not be coadminister with drug4 . 
drug1 : the coadministration of drug2 and drug3 have not be assess under chronic condition . 
however , 10 % decrease in prothrombin time have be observe in single-dose study . 
if drug1 be give concurrently with drug2 , prothrombin time should be monitor . 
other Highly Protein-Bound Drugs : drug1 be more than 95 % bind to plasma protein . 
in vitro , drug1 do not affect the binding of drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 
caution should be use when drug1 be coadminister with other highly protein-bound drug , such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 
see also clinical pharmacology , Drug-Drug interaction 
drug1 may increase the effect of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 
it may also interact with drug1 -lrb- increase thrombocytopenia -rrb- , drug2 -lrb- increase nephrotoxicity -rrb- , drug3 -lrb- increase hypoglycemic response -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- increase anticoagulant effect -rrb- , drug5 -lrb- decrease renal excretion of drug6 -rrb- , drug7 -lrb- decrease hepatic clearance of drug8 -rrb- . 
drug1 , such as the drug2 -lrb- drug3 , drug4 , drug5 -rrb- or drug6 , ordinarily should not be administer concurrently with drug7 -lrb- a drug8 -rrb- ; 
these agent may diminish the effectiveness of drug1 . 
because drug1 be approximately 90 % bind to plasma protein , caution should be exercise if drug2 be coadminister with other drug know to affect protein binding . 
drug interaction : woman on oral drug1 have show a significant increase in plasma drug2 level . 
the effect of drug1 on gastrointestinal motility be antagonize by drug2 and drug3 . 
additive sedative effect can occur when drug1 be give with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 . 
the finding that drug1 release catecholamine in patient with essential hypertension suggest that it should be use cautiously , if at all , in patient receive drug2 . 
absorption of drug from the stomach may be diminish -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- by drug2 , whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drug from the small bowel may be increase -lrb- e.g. , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 -rrb- . 
gastroparesis -lrb- gastric stasis -rrb- may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patient . 
exogenously administer drug1 may begin to act before food have leave the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia . 
because the action of drug1 will influence the delivery of food to the intestine and thus the rate of absorption , drug2 dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment . 
the pharmacokinetic interaction list below be potentially clinically important . 
drug that induce hepatic enzyme such as drug1 , drug2 and drug3 may increase the clearance of drug4 and may require increase in drug5 dose to achieve the desire response . 
drug such as drug1 and drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 and thus decrease they clearance . 
therefore , the dose of drug1 should be titrate to avoid steroid toxicity . 
drug1 may increase the clearance of chronic high dose drug2 . 
this could lead to decrease drug1 serum level or increase the risk of drug2 toxicity when drug3 be withdraw . 
drug1 should be use cautiously in conjunction with drug2 in patient suffer from hypoprothrombinemia . 
the effect of drug1 on oral drug2 be variable . 
there be report of enhance as well as diminished effect of drug1 when give concurrently with drug2 . 
therefore , coagulation index should be monitor to maintain the desire anticoagulant effect . 
co-administration of oral drug1 200 mg twice daily increase drug2 geometric mean auc -lrb- 0-24 -rrb- and cmax by 81 % after topical application of drug3 ointment , 1 % on the abraded skin of healthy adult male . 
due to low systemic exposure to drug1 follow topical application in patient , dosage adjustment for drug2 be unnecessary when co-administer with cyp3a4 inhibitor , such as drug3 . 
base on in vitro p450 inhibition study and the low systemic exposure observe follow topical application of drug1 , drug2 be unlikely to affect the metabolism of other p450 substrate . 
the effect of concurrent application of drug1 and other topical product to the same area of skin have not be study . 
drug1 may interact with drug2 -lrb- drug3 type -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- e.g. , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 -rrb- , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 -lrb- e.g. , drug14 -rrb- , other drug15 , drug16 supplement , drug17 , drug18 -lrb- e.g. , drug19 - drug20 -rrb- , drug21 -lrb- e.g. , drug22 , drug23 -rrb- . 
drug1 be highly protein bind , and therefore , might be expect to displace other protein-bound drug . 
although this have not occur in in vitro study with drug1 , interaction with drug2 have be report with drug3 since marketing , therefore , physician should closely monitor patient for a change in dosage requirement when administer drug4 to patient on drug5 and other highly protein-bound drug . 
plasma level of drug1 be depress to approximately 80 % of they normal value when drug2 be administer in conjunction with drug3 -lrb- 3900 mg/day -rrb- , but concomitant administration of drug4 have no effect on drug5 plasma level . drug6 , include drug7 , have be report to increase steady state plasma drug8 level . 
it be recommend that plasma drug1 level be monitor when initiate , adjust and discontinue drug2 . 
when administer concurrently , drug1 may increase the effect of oral drug2 ; 
monitor and adjust drug1 dosage accordingly . 
drug/laboratory test interaction : physiologic effect of drug1 may result in decrease estradiol concentration with radioimmunoassay for estradiol , increase plasma calcium concentration , and increase 24-hour urinary excretion of creatine and 17-ketosteroid . 
although a causal relationship have not be establish , there have be report of bleeding and/or prolonged prothrombin time in patient treat with drug1 with and without drug2 or drug3 . 
patient on drug1 should have more frequent monitoring of prothrombin time , while patient with other risk factor complicate by hemorrhage -lrb- e.g. , recent surgery , peptic ulceration -rrb- should have periodic examination for bleed include hematocrit and/or hemoglobin . 
concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 - contain drug lead to increase drug3 level and drug4 toxicity in some individual . 
such patient should be closely monitor for sign of toxicity and have they drug1 dosage adjust as necessary . 
drug1 have be use concurrently with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 , without observe problem . 
small decrease in blood pressure have be observe in some patient treat with drug1 ; 
periodic systemic blood pressure monitoring be recommend for patient receive concomitant antihypertensive therapy . 
if indicate , dosage of the drug1 should be reduce . 
drug interaction : the use of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- injection before drug3 , for the purpose of attenuate some of the side effect of drug4 , have not be study . 
if drug1 be administer follow administration of drug2 , it should not be give until recovery from drug3 have be observe . 
the median duration of action of drug1 0.6 mg/kg administer after a 1 mg/kg dose of drug2 when t 1 return to 75 % of control be 36 minute -lrb- range 14-57 , n = 12 -rrb- vs. 
28 minute -lrb- 17-51 , n = 12 -rrb- without drug1 . 
there be no controlled study document the use of drug1 before or after other drug2 . 
interaction have be observe when other drug1 have be administer in succession . 
drug/laboratory test interaction : none know . 
concurrent administration of drug1 -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 -rrb- may diminish the bactericidal effect of drug4 by slow the rate of bacterial growth . 
bactericidal agent work most effectively against the immature cell wall of rapidly proliferate microorganism . 
this have be demonstrate in vitro ; 
however , the clinical significance of this interaction be not well document . 
there be few clinical situation in which the concurrent use of '' static '' and '' cidal '' drug1 be indicate . 
however , in select circumstance in which such therapy be appropriate , use adequate dose of drug1 agent and begin penicillin therapy first , should minimize the potential for interaction . 
drug1 blood level may be prolong by concurrent administration of drug2 which block the renal tubular secretion of drug3 . 
displacement of drug1 from plasma protein binding site will elevate the level of free drug2 in the serum . 
catecholamine-depleting drug -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- may have a additive effect when give with drug2 . 
patient receive drug1 plus a catecholamine-depleting agent should , therefore , be closely observe for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
drug1 have be use with a variety of drug2 , include drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 without unexpected adverse interaction . 
drug1 have be show to increase serum drug2 level when both drug be co-administered . 
drug1 level may also be increase with this combination . 
risk of anaphylactic reaction : while take drug1 , patient with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergen may be more reactive to repeat challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
such patient may be unresponsive to the usual dose of drug1 use to treat allergic reaction . 
although specific drug or food interaction with drug1 have not be study , on the basis of this drug s metabolism by cyp 3a4 , it be possible that drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism -lrb- increase serum level of drug5 -rrb- . 
furthermore , drug1 , drug2 , St. 
John be Wort , and certain drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- may induce drug5 metabolism -lrb- lower serum level of drug6 -rrb- . 
base on in vitro inhibition information , coadministration of drug1 may lead to a increase in serum level of drug that be cyp 3a4 substrate . 
due to the slow elimination of drug1 from the body , such interaction may be observe for a prolonged period after its administration . 
therefore , caution should be exercise when drug1 be administer with drug that be cyp 3a4 substrate and have narrow therapeutic range , include some agent use during general anesthesia . 
concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 have be associate with erythema and histamine-like flushing and anaphylactoid reaction . 
concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drug , such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or drug7 , when indicate , require careful monitoring . 
potential for drug1 to affect other drug drug2 be not expect to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interaction with drug that be metabolize by cytochrome p450 isozyme . 
in vitro study in human liver microsome show that drug1 do not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drug metabolize by cytochrome p450 isozyme , include cyp1a2 , cyp2a6 , cyp2c8/9/10 , cyp2d6 , cyp2e1 , cyp3a4 , and cyp3a5 . 
therefore , drug1 be not expect to inhibit clearance of drug that be metabolize by these metabolic pathway in a clinically relevant manner . 
drug1 be also not expect to have enzyme induce property . 
at therapeutic concentration , drug1 do not inhibit p-glycoprotein . 
drug1 be therefore not expect to inhibit p-glycoprotein-mediated transport of other drug in a clinically relevant manner . 
give the primary cns effect of drug1 , drug2 should be use with caution in combination with other drug3 and drug4 . 
drug1 may antagonize the effect of drug2 and other drug3 . 
because of its potential for induce orthostatic hypotension , a additive effect may be observe when drug1 be administer with other therapeutic agent that have this potential . 
potential for other drug to affect drug1 drug2 be not a substrate of cyp1a2 , cyp2a6 , cyp2c9 , and cyp2c19 , so that a interaction with inhibitor or inducer of these isozyme be unlikely . 
while in vitro study indicate that cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 may be minimally involve in drug1 metabolism , in vivo study do not show decrease elimination by these isozyme and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance . 
the interaction of drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- with other drug have not be study in human . 
patient who be receive drug1 concurrently with other drug , especially drug with cns activity , should be monitor carefully . 
decrease seizure threshold have be report in patient receive drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 
cyp 3a4 inhibitor -lrb- e.g. drug1 and drug2 -rrb- there have be rare report of serious adverse event in connection with the coadministration of certain drug3 -lrb- e.g. drug4 and drug5 -rrb- and potent cyp 3a4 inhibitor , result in vasospasm lead to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremity . 
although there have be no report of such interaction with drug1 alone , potent cyp 3a4 inhibitor should not be coadminister with methylergonovine . 
example of some of the more potent cyp 3a4 inhibitor include drug1 -lrb- e.g. , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- , drug5 or drug6 -lrb- e.g. , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 -rrb- or drug11 -lrb- e.g. , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 -rrb- . 
less potent cyp 3a4 inhibitor should be administer with caution . 
less potent inhibitor include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , grapefruit juice , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 
these list be not exhaustive , and the prescriber should consider the effect on cyp 3a4 of other agent be consider for concomitant use with drug1 . 
no pharmacokinetic interaction involve other cytochrome p450 isoenzyme be know . 
caution should be exercise when drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- be use concurrently with other drug3 or drug4 .

drug1 may compete with other drug , such as drug2 , for site of metabolism in the liver , thus elevate the serum level of such compound to potentially toxic level . 
therefore , when concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 be anticipate , it may be necessary to monitor blood level and/or reduce the dosage of such compound . 
such concomitant use should be administer under careful medical supervision . 
administration of drug1 decrease oral clearance of drug2 by about 5 % . 
the clinical implication of this effect be not know . 
patient with severe hepatic or renal impairment caution should be exercise when drug1 capsule be administer to patient with severe hepatic or renal impairment .

drug1 : absorption of a single dose of drug2 be decrease when administer to 12 stable renal transplant patient also take drug3 - drug4 contain drug5 -lrb- 30 ml -rrb- : the mean cmax and auc -lrb- 0-t -rrb- value for MPA be 25 % and 37 % lower , respectively , than when drug6 be administer alone under fasting condition . 
it be recommend that drug1 and drug2 not be administer simultaneously . 
drug1 : when study in stable renal transplant patient , drug2 , usp -lrb- modify -rrb- pharmacokinetic be unaffected by steady state dosing of drug3 . 
drug1 / drug2 : may be take with drug3 ; 
however , during the period of treatment , physician should monitor blood cell count . 
both drug1 / drug2 and drug3 concentration be increase in the presence of renal impairment , they coexistence may compete for tubular secretion and further increase in the concentration of the two . 
drug1 / drug2 : give that drug3 and drug4 inhibit purine metabolism , it be recommend that drug5 not be administer concomitantly with drug6 or drug7 . 
drug1 and drug that bind Bile Acids : these drug interrupt enterohepatic recirculation and reduce drug2 exposure when coadminister with drug3 . 
therefore , do not administer drug1 with drug2 or other agent that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drug that may bind bile acid , for example bile acid sequestrate or oral drug3 , because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of drug4 . 
oral drug1 : give the different metabolism of drug2 and oral drug3 , no drug interaction between these two class of drug be expect . 
however , in a drug-drug interaction study , mean drug1 auc be decrease by 15 % when coadminister with drug2 . 
therefore , it be recommend that oral drug1 be co - administer with drug2 with caution and additional birth control method be consider . 
drug1 : during treatment with drug2 , the use of drug3 should be avoid and patient should be advise that vaccination may be less effective . 
influenza vaccination may be of value . 
prescriber should refer to national guideline for influenza vaccination . 
drug that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with drug1 by disrupt enterohepatic recirculation . 
interference of drug1 hydrolysis may lead to less drug2 available for absorption . 
drug1 have be use concomitantly with other drug commonly use in copd without increase in adverse drug reaction . 
these include drug1 , drug2 , and oral and inhale drug3 . 
however , the co administration of drug1 with other drug2 contain drug -lrb- e.g. , drug3 -rrb- have not be study and be therefore not recommend . 
interaction with other drug1 : drug2 should be USED with great caution and in REDUCED DOSAGE in patient who be concurrently receive other drug3 , GENERAL drug4 , drug5 , other drug6 , drug7 -lrb- include drug8 -rrb- , drug9 and other drug10 -lrb- include drug11 -rrb- .

the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 capsule be investigate . 
the result indicate significant change in drug1 clearance -lrb- 26 % decrease -rrb- and auc -lrb- 44 % increase -rrb- . 
therefore , drug1 capsule should be use with caution in combination with drug2 , particularly at dose higher than 0.4 mg . 
result from limit in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction study between drug1 and drug2 be inconclusive . 
therefore , caution should be exercise with concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 capsule . 
catecholamine-depleting drug -lrb- e.g. , drug1 -rrb- may have a additive effect when give with drug2 . 
patient treat with extended release drug1 plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observe for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia , which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
concomitant administration contra-indicate : - vasoconstrictive drug1 . 
concomitant administration not recommend : - drug1 and drug2 : certain drug3 interact with drug4 and drug5 lead to increase serum concentration of the latter . 
this may result in severe ventricular arrhythmia , typically torsades de pointe . 
although such a reaction have not be demonstrate with drug1 , concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 or drug4 be not recommend . 
- drug1 , drug2 : other drug such as drug3 or drug4 , which be metabolise by hepatic cyp3a isozyme have be associate with qt interval prolongation and/or cardiac arrythmia -lrb- typically torsades de pointe -rrb- as a result of increase in they serum level subsequent to interaction with significant inhibitor of the isozyme , include some drug5 . 
although such a risk be not verify for drug1 , combination of drug2 with such drug be not recommend . 
drug1 : the effect of chronic drug2 use on the metabolism of drug3 be not know . 
when a single 100 mg dose of drug1 be administer one hour after the initiation of drug2 -lrb- 300 mg four time a day -rrb- , the apparent total drug3 clearance of this single dose in normal healthy adult be reduce by 18 % -lrb- compare to the apparent total drug4 clearance in the same subject in the absence of drug5 -rrb- . 
drug1 : drug2 , 100 mg , be give twice daily for 13 day to 12 healthy volunteer . 
on day 11 , drug1 -lrb- 650 mg four time daily -rrb- be start and continue for 8 day . 
the pharmacokinetic of drug1 be assess on day 11 and 13 .

on day 11 , drug1 -lrb- 650 mg , four time daily -rrb- be start and continue for 8 day . 
the pharmacokinetic of drug1 be assess on day 11 and 13 . 
peak plasma concentration and auc of drug1 be reduce approximately 10 % in the presence of drug2 . 
because drug1 have be show to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patient who be on drug2 therapy may require downward adjustment of they drug3 dosage . 
since bacteriostatic drug may interfere with the bactericidal action of drug1 , it be advisable to avoid give drug2 in conjunction with drug3 . 
absorption of drug1 be impair by drug2 contain drug3 , drug4 or drug5 , and drug6 - contain preparation . 
the concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 have be report to result in fatal renal toxicity . 
concurrent use of drug1 with oral drug2 may render oral drug3 less effective . 
there have be no formal drug interaction study perform with drug1 in human . 
administration of drug1 in combination with drug2 result in a two-fold decrease in drug3 clearance in a non-human primate study and in a 1.5-fold increase in drug4 serum level in clinical study . 
the concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 that produce dry mouth , constipation , and other anticholinergic pharmacological effect may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effect . 
drug1 may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administer drug due to anticholinergic effect on gastrointestinal motility . 
drug eliminate by active tubular secretion : although study to assess drug-drug interaction with drug1 have not be conduct , drug2 have the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction with other drug that be eliminate by active tubular secretion -lrb- e.g. drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and drug9 -rrb- . 
coadministration of drug1 with drug that be eliminate by active renal tubular secretion may increase the serum concentration of drug2 and/or the coadminister drug due to competition for this elimination pathway . 
careful patient monitoring be recommend in patient receive such drug . 
Drug-Laboratory-Test interaction interaction between drug1 and laboratory test have not be study . 
caution should be observe in administer drug1 to patient receive drug2 or drug3 because the extrapyramidal effect of these drug can be expect to be potentiate by inhibition of catecholamine synthesis .

while in vitro study have show that drug1 be not a potent inhibitor of any of these enzyme , a indication that drug2 be not likely to have a clinically significant inhibitory effect on the metabolism of other drug that be substrate for these cytochrome p450 enzyme , the concomitant use of drug3 with most other drug metabolize by these enzyme have not be formally study . 
consequently , it be not possible to make any definitive statement about the risk of coadministration of drug1 with such drug . 
drug1 : concomitant administration of drug2 -lrb- equivalent to 60 g -rrb- have a minimal effect on plasma level of drug3 -lrb- 15 mg -rrb- in 6 healthy male subject . 
however , the impairment of cognitive and motor skill produce by drug1 be show to be additive with those produce by drug2 . 
accordingly , patient should be advise to avoid drug1 while take drug2 . drug3 : concomitant administration of drug4 -lrb- 15 mg -rrb- have a minimal effect on plasma level of drug5 -lrb- 15 mg -rrb- in 12 healthy subject . 
however , the impairment of motor skill produce by drug1 have be show to be additive with those cause by drug2 . 
accordingly , patient should be advise to avoid drug1 and other similar drug while take drug2 . 
drug1 : spontaneous adverse reaction report of patient take concomitant drug2 with recommend dose of drug3 demonstrate qt interval prolongation and rare serious cardiac event , e.g. 
death , cardiac arrest , and ventricular arrhythmia include torsade de pointe . 
pharmacokinetic datum indicate that drug1 markedly inhibit the metabolism of drug2 , result in elevated plasma drug3 level . 
presence of unchanged drug1 be associate with statistically significant prolongation of the QT and QTc interval . 
concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 be contraindicate . 
drug1 : Torsades de pointes and elevated parent drug2 level have be report during concomitant use of drug3 and drug4 in clinical trial of drug5 and from foreign post-marketing source . 
one death have also be report from foreign post - marketing source . 
concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 be contraindicate . 
due to the chemical similarity of other drug1 -lrb- include drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 -rrb- to drug5 , and drug6 , concomitant use of these product with drug7 be not recommend pend full examination of potential interaction . 
drug1 : clinical drug interaction study indicate that drug2 and drug3 can exert a effect on drug4 metabolism by a mechanism which may be similar to that of drug5 , but to a lesser extent . 
although erythromycin measurably decrease the clearance of the drug1 acid metabolite , its influence on terfenadine plasma level be still under investigation . 
a few spontaneous account of qt interval prolongation with ventricular arrhythmia include torsade de pointe , have be report in patient receive drug1 or drug2 . 
concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 be contraindicate : pend full characterization of potential interaction , concomitant administration of drug5 with other drug6 , include drug7 , be not recommend . 
study to evaluate potential interaction of drug1 with drug2 be in progress . 
acromegalic patient with diabetes mellitus be treat with drug1 and/or oral drug2 agent may require dose reduction of these therapeutic agent after the initiation of therapy with drug3 . 
in clinical study , patient on drug1 often need higher serum drug2 concentration to achieve appropriate igf-i suppression compare with patient not receive drug3 . 
the mechanism of this interaction be not know . 
drug1 should be use with caution in digitalized patient , since the combination of drug2 and drug3 may cause ectopic arrhythmia . 
drug1 or drug2 may potentiate the action of drug3 . 
therefore , when initiate pressor therapy in patient receive these drug , the initial dose should be small and give with caution . 
drug1 , a bacteriostatic drug2 , may antagonize the bactericidal effect of drug3 and concurrent use of these drug should be avoid . 
concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 may result in a adverse drug interaction . 
drug1 have be study on a background of drug2 and drug3 . 
the use of drug1 , in combination with drug2 and drug3 , have be associate with a increase in bleed compare to drug4 and drug5 alone -lrb- see 
drug interaction : inhibitor of cyp3a4 isozyme : caution be advise when drug1 be administer concomitantly with drug that be know to inhibit the cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme system -lrb- ie , some drug in the drug class of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -rrb- . 
drug such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 be show to significantly increase the c max and auc of orally administer drug7 . 
these drug interaction may result in increase and prolong sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of drug1 . 
although not study , the potent cytochrome p450 3a4 inhibitor drug1 and drug2 may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of drug3 . 
caution be advise when drug1 be use concomitantly with these drug . 
dose adjustment should be consider and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipate . 
inducer of cyp3a4 isozyme : cytochrome p450 inducer , such as drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 , induce metabolism and cause a markedly decrease c max and auc of oral drug4 in adult study . 
although clinical study have not be perform , drug1 be expect to have the same effect . 
caution be advise when administer drug1 to patient receive these medication and if necessary dose adjustment should be consider . 
the difficulty in achieve adequate sedation may have be the result of decrease absorption of the drug1 due to both the gastrointestinal effect and stimulant effect of drug2 . 
the sedative effect of drug1 be accentuate by any concomitantly administer medication which depress the central nervous system , particularly drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 -rrb- , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 and drug10 . 
consequently , the dose of drug1 should be adjust accord to the type and amount of concomitant medication administer and the desire clinical response . 
no significant adverse interaction with common premedication -lrb- such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and other drug6 -rrb- or local drug7 have be observe . 
the concomitant use of other drug1 include drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , general drug5 , drug6 , other drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 may produce additive cn depressant effect . 
when such combined therapy be contemplate , the dose of one or both agent should be reduce . 
drug1 or other medication with anticholinergic activity when use concurrently with drug2 may result in increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation , which may lead to paralytic ileus . 
it have be report that the incidence of bradycardia be increase when drug1 be combine with drug2 for induction of anesthesia . 
in addition , cns toxicity have be report -lrb- confusion , disorientation , respiratory depression , apnea , seizure -rrb- follow coadministration of drug1 with drug2 ; 
no clear-cut cause and effect relationship be establish . 
dosage of concomitantly administer drug1 should be reduce by approximately half , because drug2 amplify the therapeutic action and side-effect of drug3 . 
combination with drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- be associate with increase risk of seizure . 
additive sedative effect and confusional state may emerge if drug1 be give with drug2 or drug3 . 
this may be avoid by use the lowest dose possible with the substance in question . 
exert particular caution in combine drug1 with other drug2 -lrb- drug3 and drug4 -rrb- : particularly the elderly may develop delirium , high fever , severe obstipation , even ileus and glaucoma . 
reduce both the dose of drug1 and the dose of the other drug . 
if possible , avoid such combination . 
drug1 and/or stimulante of the drug2 / drug3 type may counteract the specific action of drug4 . 
concomitant use of these substance should be avoid . 
Coffee and black tea should be avoid because they decrease the absorption of drug1 considerably . 
the same be true for drug1 ; 
these should be give 1 to 2 hour before or after oral administration of drug1 . 
usage with drug1 : due to the potential for increase cns depressant effect , drug2 should be use with caution in patient who be currently receive drug3 . 
the cns depressant effect of drug1 may be additive with that of other drug2 . . 
limited evidence suggest that drug1 may influence the intensity and duration of action of drug2 . 
drug1 : in a multiple-dose study in 30 normal weight subject , coadministration of drug2 and 40 gram of drug3 -lrb- e.g. , approximately 3 glass of wine -rrb- do not result in alteration of drug4 pharmacokinetic , drug5 pharmacodynamic -lrb- fecal fat excretion -rrb- , or systemic exposure to drug6 . 
drug1 : preliminary datum from a drug2 and drug3 drug interaction study indicate a reduction in drug4 plasma level when drug5 be coadminister with drug6 . 
drug1 : in 12 normal-weight subject receive drug2 120 mg three time a day for 6 day , drug3 do not alter the pharmacokinetic of a single dose of drug4 . 
drug1 and analogue : a pharmacokinetic interaction study show a 30 % reduction in drug2 supplement absorption when concomitantly administer with drug3 . 
drug1 inhibit absorption of a drug2 supplement by approximately 60 % . 
the effect of drug1 on the absorption of supplemental drug2 , drug3 , and nutritionally-derived drug4 be not know at this time . 
drug1 : in 12 normal-weight subject receive drug2 80 mg three time a day for 5 day , drug3 do not alter the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic -lrb- blood glucose-lowering -rrb- of drug4 .

oral drug1 : in 20 normal-weight female subject , the treatment of drug2 120 mg three time a day for 23 day result in no change in the ovulation-suppressing action of oral drug3 . 
drug1 : in 12 normal-weight subject receive drug2 120 mg three time a day for 7 day , drug3 do not alter the pharmacokinetic of a single 300-mg dose of drug4 . 
drug1 : in a 2-way crossover study of 24 normal-weight , mildly hypercholesterolemic patient receive drug2 120 mg three time a day for 6 day , drug3 do not affect the pharmacokinetic of drug4 . 
drug1 : in 12 normal-weight subject , administration of drug2 120 mg three time a day for 16 day do not result in any change in either drug3 pharmacokinetic -lrb- both r - and s-enantiomer -rrb- or pharmacodynamic -lrb- prothrombin time and serum factor vii -rrb- . 
although undercarboxylated osteocalcin , a marker of vitamin k nutritional status , be unaltered with drug1 administration , vitamin k level tend to decline in subject take drug2 . 
therefore , as drug1 absorption may be decrease with drug2 , patient on chronic stable dose of drug3 who be prescribe drug4 should be monitor closely for change in coagulation parameter . 
drug1 compete with drug2 for active tubular secretion and thus inhibit the renal excretion of drug3 . 
this lead to statistically significant increase in the elimination half-life -lrb- 38 % -rrb- and in the extent of systemic exposure -lrb- 56 % -rrb- . 
therefore , the coadministration of drug1 with drug2 be not recommend . 
there be evidence that drug1 may reduce serum level of drug2 to subtherapeutic level -lrb- therapeutic range consider to be 50 to 100 g/ml total drug3 -rrb- . 
drug1 do not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome p-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver . 
because drug1 be metabolize by hepatic cytochrome p-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme -lrb- cyp3a4 , cyp2d6 , cyp1a2 -rrb- , inducer or inhibitor of these enzyme may change the clearance and , hence , the half-life of drug2 . 
on the basis of limited available datum , no dosage adjustment be recommend for patient on these drug . 
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 : in patient treat with potent inducer of cyp3a4 -lrb- i.e. , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 -rrb- , the clearance of drug7 be significantly increase and drug8 blood concentration be decrease . 
however , on the basis of available datum , no dosage adjustment for drug1 be recommend for patient on these drug .1,3 drug2 : although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between drug3 and drug4 have be observe , datum from 2 small study indicate that drug5 may be associate with a increase in patient controlled administration of drug6 .4,5 Chemotherapy : tumor response to chemotherapy in the p 388 mouse leukemia model be not affect by drug7 . 
in human , drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 do not affect the pharmacokinetic of drug4 . 
in a crossover study in 76 pediatric patient , I.V. 
drug1 do not increase blood level of high-dose drug2 . 
cyp3a4 inhibitor : drug1 , a inhibitor of the drug metabolize enzyme cyp3a4 , significantly increase plasma concentration of drug2 when coadminister to subject who be poor metabolizer -lrb- see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , variability in metabolism and Drug-Drug interaction -rrb- . 
for patient receive drug1 or other potent cyp3a4 inhibitor such as other drug2 -lrb- eg , drug3 , drug4 -rrb- or drug5 -lrb- eg , drug6 , drug7 -rrb- or drug8 or drug9 , the recommend dose of drug10 be 2 mg daily . 
Drug-Laboratory-Test interaction interaction between drug1 and laboratory test have not be study . 
since drug1 be metabolize by a p450 enzyme system , drug that induce or inhibit this drug metabolize enzyme system may elicit important drug-drug interaction that may alter drug2 plasma concentration . 
agent that might be coadminister with drug1 in aids patient for other indication that could elicit this activity include drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
in vitro perfusion of isolate rat liver have show that drug1 cause a significant reduction in drug2 metabolism and that drug3 alter the relative concentration of trimetrexate metabolite possibly by compete for sulfate metabolite .

these agent may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of drug1 by as much as 35 % to 40 % . 
a greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effect of drug1 may be expect with higher concentration of drug2 or drug3 . 
drug1 have little or no effect on the ed50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20 % . 
other drug which may enhance the neuromuscular block action of drug1 such as drug2 include certain drug3 -lrb- e.g. , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 -rrb- , drug12 salt , drug13 , local drug14 , drug15 , and drug16 . 
the neuromuscular blocking effect of drug1 may be enhance by drug that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity -lrb- e.g. , chronically administer oral drug2 , drug3 , or certain drug4 -rrb- or by drug that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . resistance to the neuromuscular block action of nondepolarizing drug5 have be demonstrate in patient chronically administer drug6 or drug7 . 
while the effect of chronic drug1 or drug2 therapy on the action of drug3 be unknown , slightly shorter duration of neuromuscular block may be anticipate and infusion rate requirement may be higher . 
some drug interaction be : - birth control pill - drug1 - medicine for angina or high blood pressure - medicine for pain - medicine to control seizure such as drug2 or drug3 - certain drug4 give by injection - drug5 - drug6 - drug7 - drug8 or drug9 - local drug10 such as drug11 - general drug12 - drug13 or other drug14 
clinically or potentially significant drug interaction between drug1 and the follow agents/classes have be observe . 
these be describe in greater detail below : drug1 and the follow agents/classes have be observe . 
these be describe in greater detail below : oral drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , oral drug13 : clinically significant hypoglycemia may be precipitate by the use of drug14 with oral drug15 ; 
one fatality have be report from hypoglycemia in association with combined drug1 and drug2 use . 
drug1 reduce the metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 and increase the plasma concentration of these agent .

depend on clinical circumstance , consideration should be give to increase the dose of drug1 when it be administer with drug2 . 
drug1 : drug2 increase the serum concentration of drug3 . 
careful monitoring of serum drug1 concentration in patient receive drug2 and drug3 be recommend . 
drug1 : because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmia secondary to prolongation of the qtc interval in patient receive drug2 in conjunction with drug3 , interaction study have be perform . 
one study at a 200-mg daily dose of drug1 fail to demonstrate a prolongation in qtc interval . 
another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of drug1 demonstrate that drug2 take in dose of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increase plasma level of drug3 when take concomitantly . 
the combine use of drug1 at dose of 400 mg or greater with drug2 be contraindicate . 
the coadministration of drug1 at dose lower than 400 mg/day with drug2 should be carefully monitor . 
drug1 : there have be report of cardiac event , include torsade de pointe in patient to whom drug2 and drug3 be coadminister . 
a controlled study find that concomitant drug1 200 mg once daily and drug2 20 mg four time a day yield a significant increase in drug3 plasma level and prolongation of qtc interval . 
the combine use of drug1 with drug2 be contraindicate . 
drug1 : the use of drug2 in patient concurrently take drug3 or other drug metabolize by the cytochrome p450 system may be associate with elevation in serum level of these drug . 
in the absence of definitive information , caution should be use when coadminister drug1 . 
patient should be carefully monitor . 
drug1 : there have be report of uveitis in patient to whom drug2 and drug3 be coadminister . 
patient receive drug1 and drug2 concomitantly should be carefully monitor . 
drug1 : there have be report of nephrotoxicity in patient to whom drug2 and drug3 be coadminister . 
patient receive drug1 and drug2 concomitantly should be carefully monitor . 
drug1 : follow oral administration of drug2 , drug3 result in substantial increase in drug4 concentration and psychomotor effect . 
this effect on drug1 appear to be more pronounced follow oral administration of drug2 than with drug3 administer intravenously . 
if drug1 , which be metabolize by the cytochrome p450 system , be concomitantly administer with drug2 , consideration should be give to decrease the drug3 dosage , and the patient should be appropriately monitor . 
drug1 tablet coadminister with drug2 - and drug3 - contain oral drug4 produce a overall mean increase in drug5 and drug6 level ; 
however , in some patient there be decrease up to 47 % and 33 % of drug1 and drug2 level . 
the datum presently available indicate that the decrease in some individual drug1 and drug2 auc value with drug3 treatment be likely the result of random variation . 
while there be evidence that drug1 can inhibit the metabolism of drug2 and drug3 , there be no evidence that drug4 be a net inducer of drug5 or drug6 metabolism . 
the clinical significance of these effect be presently unknown . 
Physicians should be aware that interaction study with medication other than those list in the < a href = `` flucon_cp . htm #cp '' > CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not be conduct , but such interaction may occur . 
the interaction of drug1 , drug2 , with other drug have not be well study . 
use of drug1 and drug2 -- drug3 , drug4 , alone or in combination with drug5 and drug6 , may cause bleeding complication . 
therefore , careful monitoring be advise . 
in the treatment of acute MI , drug1 , when not otherwise contraindicate , should be administer with drug2 -lrb- see below -rrb- . 
anticoagulation and drug1 after treatment for myocardial infarction -- in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction , the use of drug2 have be show to reduce the incidence of reinfarction and stroke . 
the addition of drug1 to drug2 cause a minimal increase in the risk of minor bleeding -lrb- 3.9 % vs. 3.1 % -rrb- , but do not appear to increase the incidence of major bleeding -lrb- see 
when drug1 be use with other drug2 , potentiation of antihypertensive effect may occur . 
patient should be follow carefully to detect side reaction or unusual manifestation of drug idiosyncrasy . 
patient may require reduced dose of drug1 when on drug2 . 
if hypotension do occur during anesthesia , it usually can be control by drug1 . 
the adrenergic receptor remain sensitive during treatment with drug1 . 
when drug1 and drug2 be give concomitantly the patient should be carefully monitor for symptom of drug3 toxicity . 
read the circular for drug1 preparation . 
several study demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of drug1 when it be ingest with drug2 or drug3 . 
this may adversely affect blood pressure control in patient treat with drug1 . 
coadministration of drug1 with drug2 or drug3 be not recommend . 
drug1 : see contraindication . 
drug/laboratory test interaction drug1 may interfere with measurement of : urinary uric acid by the phosphotungstate method , serum creatinine by the alkaline picrate method , and sgot by colorimetric method . 
interference with spectrophotometric method for sgot analysis have not be report . 
since drug1 cause fluorescence in urine sample at the same wave length as catecholamine , falsely high level of urinary catecholamine may be report . 
this will interfere with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma . 
it be important to recognize this phenomenon before a patient with a possible pheochromocytoma be subject to surgery . 
drug1 do not interfere with measurement of drug2 -lrb- drug3 -rrb- , a test for pheochromocytoma , by those method which convert drug4 to drug5 . 
drug1 be not recommend for the treatment of patient with pheochromocytoma . 
rarely , when urine be expose to air after void , it may darken because of breakdown of drug1 or its metabolite . 
drug1 : concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may result in increase systemic toxicity since drug4 inhibit the breakdown of drug5 . 
Antimyasthenics concurrent use of drug1 and antimyasthenic may result in loss of control of symptom of myasthenia gravis due to antagonism of the effect of antimyasthenic on skeletal muscle . 
temporary dosage adjustment of antimyasthenic may be require . 
also antimyasthenic may have anticholinesterase activity . 
drug1 medication : concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may result in additive depressant effect . 
drug1 : drug2 may increase the diffusion rate of drug3 , result in a decrease time of onset , but a increase in systemic toxicity . 
drug1 -lrb- such as drug2 -rrb- : concurrent use of drug3 and drug4 may result in prolongation or enhancement of the neuromuscular blockade . 
drug1 : concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may result in a reduction of the antibacterial action of the drug4 . 
drug1 : concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may extend the plasma half-life of drug4 . 
drug1 : patient on drug2 , and especially those start recently , may occasionally experience a excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of drug3 tablet therapy . 
the possibility of hypotensive effect can be minimize by either discontinue the drug1 or increase the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug2 . 
if drug1 can not be interrupted , close medical supervision should be provide with the first dose of drug2 tablet , for at least two hour and until blood pressure have stabilize for another hour . 
the rate and extent of drug1 absorption and elimination be not affect by concomitant drug2 . 
the bioavailability of drug1 be reduce by drug2 , however , and this be associate with a decrease in plasma ace inhibition . 
drug1 supplement and drug2 : drug3 tablet may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production . 
use of drug1 -lrb- drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and other -rrb- , drug5 supplement or other drug capable of increase serum potassium -lrb- drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and other -rrb- can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . 
therefore , if concomitant use of such agent be indicate , they should be give with caution and the patient 's serum potassium should be monitor frequently . 
drug1 : increase serum drug2 and symptom of drug3 toxicity have be report in patient receive concomitant drug4 and ace inhibitor therapy . 
these drug should be coadminister with caution and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 concentration be recommend . 
use of a drug1 may further increase the risk of drug2 toxicity . 
drug1 : a controlled pharmacokinetic study have show no effect on plasma drug2 concentration when coadminister with drug3 tablet , but a effect of drug4 on the plasma concentration of drug5 / drug6 have not be exclude . 
drug1 : Animal datum have suggest the possibility of interaction between drug2 and drug3 . 
however , this have not be investigate in human study . 
Coadministration of both drug should proceed with caution . 
Food interaction : oral administration of drug1 tablet with food do not significantly lower the rate or extent of drug2 absorption relative to the fasted state . 
however , the extent of biotransformation of drug1 to the active metabolite , drug2 , be reduce approximately 43 % , result in a reduction in the plasma ace inhibition curve of approximately 20 % , probably clinically insignificant . 
in clinical trial , drug1 be generally administer in a non-fasting state . 
drug1 can interact with the drug of the follow category : - blood dyscrasia : can cause unpredictable myelotoxicity - bone marrow depressant : can cause a predictable dose-related myelotoxicity - Radiation therapy : may cause marrow depression - neurotoxic medication : can cause neurologic toxicity - drug2 : can increase seizure activity - drug3 : may potentiate the replication of the drug4 virus , may increase the side effect of the vaccination , and decrease patient 's response to the vaccine - drug5 : may cause shortness of breath and bronchospasm - drug6 : may decrease patient 's response to the drug7 
drug1 inhibit some of the liver 's ability to metabolize some other drug - drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 
thus the concentration of these drug would increase mean side effect may be see . 
a dose adjustment may be require . 
the concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 or with other agent which produce dry mouth , constipation , somnolence -lrb- drowsiness -rrb- , and/or other anticholinergic-like effect may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effect . 
drug1 may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administer drug due to anticholinergic effect on gastrointestinal motility . 
this may be of concern for drug with a narrow therapeutic index . 
mean drug1 plasma concentration be approximately 2 fold higher when drug2 be administer with drug3 , a potent cyp3a4 inhibitor . 
other inhibitor of the cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme system , such as drug1 -lrb- e.g. , drug2 and drug3 -rrb- or drug4 -lrb- e.g. , drug5 and drug6 -rrb- , may alter drug7 mean pharmacokinetic parameter -lrb- i.e. , cmax and auc -rrb- . 
the clinical relevance of such potential interaction be not know . 
caution should be use when such drug be co-administered . 
concurrent ingestion of drug1 -lrb- 20 ml of drug2 contain drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 -rrb- do not significantly affect the exposure of drug6 or drug7 .
