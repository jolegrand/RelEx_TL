drug0 may interact with the following drug : drug0 and other drug0 -lrb- may low drug0 level -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- bioavailability of oral drug0 be increase with coadministration -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- may decrease drug0 level -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- report of psychotic episode when coadministered -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- coadministration of drug0 with drug0 can inhibit ovarian function in woman -rrb- , drug0 and other sedating drug -lrb- may result in additive sedation and an increase incidence of adverse effect -rrb- , and drug0 -lrb- coadministration of drug0 and drug0 may interfere with the efficacy of the drug0 -rrb- . 
in vitro study with human liver microsome show that drug0 do not inhibit the metabolism of drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
in vitro study have also show that drug0 inhibit cyp0d0-mediated metabolism . 
this may be of clinical relevance for compound predominantly metabolize by this enzyme , such as drug0 , -blockers , drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- , and drug0 , if they have a narrow therapeutic window . 
in vivo drug-drug interaction study conduct in normal volunteer subject show that drug0 do not affect the clearance of drug0 or drug0 . 
drug0 decrease the clearance of drug0 by 0 % . 
drug0 increase the clearance of drug0 by 0 % . 
there have be spontaneous report of increase or decrease in prothrombin time in patient concomitantly take oral drug0 and drug0 , however , a causal relationship between drug0 tablet and these change have not be establish . 
drug0 clearance be increase 0 % by drug0 , a cyp0 enzyme inducer , and decrease 0 % by drug0 , a cyp0 enzyme inhibitor . 
drug0 clearance be unaffected by drug0 . 
there be no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction study with the following class of drug : oral drug0 , hormone replacement therapy , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
drug0 may demonstrate additive toxicity when use in combination with other cytotoxic drug . 
drug0 have be report to prolong the elimination half-life of drug0 and may lead to severe bone marrow suppression ; 
a reduction of the drug0 dosage should be consider in patient receive drug0 concurrently . 
the concurrent use of drug0 and drug0 have be report in #crd# case to result in reduce drug0 cytotoxicity . 
drug0 : drug0 cause a 0 % reduction in the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of drug0 and should not be coadministered with drug0 . 
drug0 : the coadministration of drug0 and drug0 have not be assess under chronic condition . 
however , 0 % decrease in prothrombin time have be observe in single-dose study . 
if drug0 be give concurrently with drug0 , prothrombin time should be monitor . 
other highly protein-bound drug : drug0 be more than 0 % bind to plasma protein . 
in vitro , drug0 do not affect the binding of drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 . 
caution should be use when drug0 be coadministered with other highly protein-bound drug , such as drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
see also clinical pharmacology , drug-drug interaction 
drug0 may increase the effect of drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
it may also interact with drug0 -lrb- increase thrombocytopenia -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- increase nephrotoxicity -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- increase hypoglycemic response -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- increase anticoagulant effect -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- decrease renal excretion of drug0 -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- decrease hepatic clearance of drug0 -rrb- . 
drug0 , such as the drug0 -lrb- drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- or drug0 , ordinarily should not be administer concurrently with drug0 -lrb- a drug0 -rrb- ; 
these agent may diminish the effectiveness of drug0 . 
because drug0 be approximately 0 % bind to plasma protein , caution should be exercise if drug0 be coadministered with other drug know to affect protein binding . 
drug interaction : woman on oral drug0 have show a significant increase in plasma drug0 level . 
the effect of drug0 on gastrointestinal motility be antagonize by drug0 and drug0 . 
additive sedative effect can occur when drug0 be give with drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 . 
the finding that drug0 release catecholamine in patient with essential hypertension suggest that it should be use cautiously , if at all , in patient receive drug0 . 
absorption of drug from the stomach may be diminish -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- by drug0 , whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drug from the small bowel may be increase -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- . 
gastroparesis -lrb- gastric stasis -rrb- may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patient . 
exogenously administer drug0 may begin to act before food have left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia . 
because the action of drug0 will influence the delivery of food to the intestine and thus the rate of absorption , drug0 dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment . 
the pharmacokinetic interaction list below be potentially clinically important . 
drug that induce hepatic enzyme such as drug0 , drug0 and drug0 may increase the clearance of drug0 and may require increase in drug0 dose to achieve the desired response . 
drug such as drug0 and drug0 may inhibit the metabolism of drug0 and thus decrease their clearance . 
therefore , the dose of drug0 should be titrate to avoid steroid toxicity . 
drug0 may increase the clearance of chronic high dose drug0 . 
this could lead to decrease drug0 serum level or increase the risk of drug0 toxicity when drug0 be withdraw . 
drug0 should be use cautiously in conjunction with drug0 in patient suffer from hypoprothrombinemia . 
the effect of drug0 on oral drug0 be variable . 
there be report of enhance as well as diminish effect of drug0 when give concurrently with drug0 . 
therefore , coagulation index should be monitor to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect . 
co-administration of oral drug0 0 mg twice daily increase drug0 geometric mean auc -lrb- 0 -rrb- and cmax by 0 % after topical application of drug0 ointment , 0 % on the abraded skin of healthy adult male . 
due to low systemic exposure to drug0 follow topical application in patient , dosage adjustment for drug0 be unnecessary when co-administered with cyp0a0 inhibitor , such as drug0 . 
base on in vitro p0 inhibition study and the low systemic exposure observe follow topical application of drug0 , drug0 be unlikely to affect the metabolism of other p0 substrate . 
the effect of concurrent application of drug0 and other topical product to the same area of skin have not be study . 
drug0 may interact with drug0 -lrb- drug0 type -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- , other drug0 , drug0 supplement , drug0 , drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 - drug0 -rrb- , drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- . 
drug0 be highly protein bind , and therefore , might be expect to displace other protein-bound drug . 
although this have not occur in in vitro study with drug0 , interaction with drug0 have be report with drug0 since marketing , therefore , physician should closely monitor patient for a change in dosage requirement when administer drug0 to patient on drug0 and other highly protein-bound drug . 
plasma level of drug0 be depress to approximately 0 % of their normal value when drug0 be administer in conjunction with drug0 -lrb- 0 mg/day -rrb- , but concomitant administration of drug0 have no effect on drug0 plasma level . drug0 , include drug0 , have be report to increase steady state plasma drug0 level . 
it be recommend that plasma drug0 level be monitor when initiate , adjust and discontinue drug0 . 
when administer concurrently , drug0 may increase the effect of oral drug0 ; 
monitor and adjust drug0 dosage accordingly . 
drug/laboratory test interaction : physiologic effect of drug0 may result in decrease estradiol concentration with radioimmunoassay for estradiol , increase plasma calcium concentration , and increase 0-hour urinary excretion of creatine and 0-ketosteroids . 
although a causal relationship have not be establish , there have be report of bleeding and/or prolonged prothrombin time in patient treat with drug0 with and without drug0 or drug0 . 
patient on drug0 should have more frequent monitoring of prothrombin time , while patient with other risk factor complicate by hemorrhage -lrb- e.g. , recent surgery , peptic ulceration -rrb- should have periodic examination for bleeding include hematocrit and/or hemoglobin . 
concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 -containing drug lead to increase drug0 level and drug0 toxicity in some individual . 
such patient should be closely monitor for sign of toxicity and have their drug0 dosage adjust as necessary . 
drug0 have be use concurrently with drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 , without observe problem . 
small decrease in blood pressure have be observe in some patient treat with drug0 ; 
periodic systemic blood pressure monitoring be recommend for patient receive concomitant antihypertensive therapy . 
if indicate , dosage of the drug0 should be reduce . 
drug interaction : the use of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- injection before drug0 , for the purpose of attenuate some of the side effect of drug0 , have not be study . 
if drug0 be administer follow administration of drug0 , it should not be give until recovery from drug0 have be observe . 
the median duration of action of drug0 0 mg/kg administer after a 0 mg/kg dose of drug0 when t 0 return to 0 % of control be 0 minute -lrb- range 0 , n=0 -rrb- vs . 
0 minute -lrb- 0 , n=0 -rrb- without drug0 . 
there be no controlled study document the use of drug0 before or after other drug0 . 
interaction have be observe when other drug0 have be administer in succession . 
drug/laboratory test interaction : none know . 
concurrent administration of drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- may diminish the bactericidal effect of drug0 by slow the rate of bacterial growth . 
bactericidal agent work most effectively against the immature cell wall of rapidly proliferate microorganism . 
this have be demonstrate in vitro ; 
however , the clinical significance of this interaction be not well document . 
there be few clinical situation in which the concurrent use of '' static '' and '' cidal ' ' drug0 be indicate . 
however , in select circumstance in which such therapy be appropriate , use adequate dose of drug0 agent and begin penicillin therapy #ord# , should minimize the potential for interaction . 
drug0 blood level may be prolong by concurrent administration of drug0 which block the renal tubular secretion of drug0 . 
displacement of drug0 from plasma protein binding site will elevate the level of free drug0 in the serum . 
catecholamine-depleting drug -lrb- e.g. , drug0 -rrb- may have an additive effect when give with drug0 . 
patient receive drug0 plus a catecholamine-depleting agent should , therefore , be closely observe for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo , syncope , or postural hypotension . 
drug0 have be use with a variety of drug0 , include drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 without unexpected adverse interaction . 
drug0 have be show to increase serum drug0 level when both drug be co-administered . 
drug0 level may also be increase with this combination . 
risk of anaphylactic reaction : while take drug0 , patient with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergen may be more reactive to repeated challenge , either accidental , diagnostic , or therapeutic . 
such patient may be unresponsive to the usual dose of drug0 use to treat allergic reaction . 
although specific drug or food interaction with drug0 have not be study , on the basis of this drug s metabolism by cyp 0a0 , it be possible that drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism -lrb- increase serum level of drug0 -rrb- . 
furthermore , drug0 , drug0 , st. 
john s wort , and certain drug0 -lrb- drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- may induce drug0 metabolism -lrb- lower serum level of drug0 -rrb- . 
base on in vitro inhibition information , coadministration of drug0 may lead to an increase in serum level of drug that be cyp 0a0 substrate . 
due to the slow elimination of drug0 from the body , such interaction may be observe for a prolonged period after its administration . 
therefore , caution should be exercise when drug0 be administer with drug that be cyp 0a0 substrate and have narrow therapeutic range , include some agent use during general anesthesia . 
concomitant administration of drug0 and drug0 have be associate with erythema and histamine-like flushing and anaphylactoid reaction . 
concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drug , such as drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , or drug0 , when indicate , require careful monitoring . 
potential for drug0 to affect other drug drug0 be not expect to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interaction with drug that be metabolize by cytochrome p0 isozymes . 
in vitro study in human liver microsome show that drug0 do not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drug metabolize by cytochrome p0 isozymes , include cyp0a0 , cyp0a0 , cyp0c0 , cyp0d0 , cyp0e0 , cyp0a0 , and cyp0a0 . 
therefore , drug0 be not expect to inhibit clearance of drug that be metabolize by these metabolic pathway in a clinically relevant manner . 
drug0 be also not expect to have enzyme inducing property . 
at therapeutic concentration , drug0 do not inhibit p-glycoprotein . 
drug0 be therefore not expect to inhibit p-glycoprotein-mediated transport of other drug in a clinically relevant manner . 
given the primary cns effect of drug0 , drug0 should be use with caution in combination with other drug0 and drug0 . 
drug0 may antagonize the effect of drug0 and other drug0 . 
because of its potential for induce orthostatic hypotension , an additive effect may be observe when drug0 be administer with other therapeutic agent that have this potential . 
potential for other drug to affect drug0 drug0 be not a substrate of cyp0a0 , cyp0a0 , cyp0c0 , and cyp0c0 , so that an interaction with inhibitor or inducer of these isozymes be unlikely . 
while in vitro study indicate that cyp0d0 and cyp0a0 may be minimally involve in drug0 metabolism , in vivo study do not show decrease elimination by these isozymes and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance . 
the interaction of drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- with other drug have not be study in human . 
patient who be receive drug0 concurrently with other drug , especially drug with cns activity , should be monitor carefully . 
decrease seizure threshold have be report in patient receive drug0 concomitantly with drug0 . 
cyp 0a0 inhibitor -lrb- e.g. drug0 and drug0 -rrb- there have be rare report of serious adverse event in connection with the coadministration of certain drug0 -lrb- e.g. drug0 and drug0 -rrb- and potent cyp 0a0 inhibitor , result in vasospasm lead to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremity . 
although there have be no report of such interaction with drug0 alone , potent cyp 0a0 inhibitor should not be coadministered with methylergonovine . 
example of some of the more potent cyp 0a0 inhibitor include drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- , drug0 or drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- or drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- . 
less potent cyp 0a0 inhibitor should be administer with caution . 
less potent inhibitor include drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , grapefruit juice , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
these list be not exhaustive , and the prescriber should consider the effect on cyp 0a0 of other agent be consider for concomitant use with drug0 . 
no pharmacokinetic interaction involve other cytochrome p0 isoenzymes be know . 
caution should be exercise when drug0 -lrb- drug0 -rrb- be use concurrently with other drug0 or drug0 . 
to minimize cns depression and possible potentiation , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 or drug0 should be use with caution . 
drug0 should not be use since there may be an antabuse -lrb- disulfiram -rrb- -like reaction . 
because drug0 exhibit some monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity , drug0 , drug0 drug -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 -rrb- and other drug and food with known high drug0 content , such as wine , yogurt , ripe cheese and bananas , should be avoid . 
a far phenomenon of toxicity common to many drug0 be hemolysis and the appearance of heinz-ehrlich inclusion body in erythrocyte . 
no cross-resistance with other drug0 , radiotherapy or drug0 have be demonstrate . 
drug0 be capable of potentiating drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , etc . -rrb- 
as well as drug0 and drug0 .

also antimyasthenics may have anticholinesterase activity . 
drug0 medication : concurrent use of drug0 and drug0 may result in additive depressant effect . 
drug0 : drug0 may increase the diffusion rate of drug0 , result in a decrease time of onset , but an increase in systemic toxicity . 
drug0 -lrb- such as drug0 -rrb- : concurrent use of drug0 and drug0 may result in prolongation or enhancement of the neuromuscular blockade . 
drug0 : concurrent use of drug0 and drug0 may result in a reduction of the antibacterial action of the drug0 . 
drug0 : concurrent use of drug0 and drug0 may extend the plasma half-life of drug0 . 
drug0 : patient on drug0 , and especially those start recently , may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of drug0 tablet therapy . 
the possibility of hypotensive effect can be minimize by either discontinue the drug0 or increase the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug0 . 
if drug0 cannot be interrupt , close medical supervision should be provided with the #ord# dose of drug0 tablet , for at least #crd# hour and until blood pressure have stabilize for another hour . 
the rate and extent of drug0 absorption and elimination be not affect by concomitant drug0 . 
the bioavailability of drug0 be reduce by drug0 , however , and this be associate with a decrease in plasma ace inhibition . 
drug0 supplement and drug0 : drug0 tablet may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production . 
use of drug0 -lrb- drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and other -rrb- , drug0 supplement or other drug capable of increase serum potassium -lrb- drug0 , drug0 , drug0 and other -rrb- can increase the risk of hyperkalemia . 
therefore , if concomitant use of such agent be indicate , they should be give with caution and the patient 's serum potassium should be monitor frequently . 
drug0 : increase serum drug0 and symptom of drug0 toxicity have be report in patient receive concomitant drug0 and ace inhibitor therapy . 
these drug should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum drug0 concentration be recommend . 
use of a drug0 may far increase the risk of drug0 toxicity . 
drug0 : a controlled pharmacokinetic study have show no effect on plasma drug0 concentration when coadministered with drug0 tablet , but an effect of drug0 on the plasma concentration of drug0 / drug0 have not be exclude . 
drug0 : animal datum have suggest the possibility of interaction between drug0 and drug0 . 
however , this have not be investigate in human study . 
coadministration of both drug should proceed with caution . 
food interaction : oral administration of drug0 tablet with food do not significantly low the rate or extent of drug0 absorption relative to the fasted state . 
however , the extent of biotransformation of drug0 to the active metabolite , drug0 , be reduce approximately 0 % , result in a reduction in the plasma ace inhibition curve of approximately 0 % , probably clinically insignificant . 
in clinical trial , drug0 be generally administer in a non-fasting state . 
drug0 can interact with the drug of the following category : - blood dyscrasia : can cause unpredictable myelotoxicity - bone marrow depressant : can cause a predictable dose-related myelotoxicity - radiation therapy : may cause marrow depression - neurotoxic medication : can cause neurologic toxicity - drug0 : can increase seizure activity - drug0 : may potentiate the replication of the drug0 virus , may increase the side effect of the vaccination , and decrease patient 's response to the vaccine - drug0 : may cause shortness of breath and bronchospasm - drug0 : may decrease patient 's response to the drug0 
drug0 inhibit some of the liver 's ability to metabolize some other drug - drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 . 
thus the concentration of these drug would increase meaning side effect may be see . 
a dose adjustment may be require . 
the concomitant use of drug0 with other drug0 or with other agent which produce dry mouth , constipation , somnolence -lrb- drowsiness -rrb- , and/or other anticholinergic-like effect may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effect . 
drug0 may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administer drug due to anticholinergic effect on gastrointestinal motility . 
this may be of concern for drug with a narrow therapeutic index . 
mean drug0 plasma concentration be approximately 0 fold high when drug0 be administer with drug0 , a potent cyp0a0 inhibitor . 
other inhibitor of the cytochrome p0 0a0 enzyme system , such as drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 and drug0 -rrb- or drug0 -lrb- e.g. , drug0 and drug0 -rrb- , may alter drug0 mean pharmacokinetic parameter -lrb- i.e. , cmax and auc -rrb- . 
the clinical relevance of such potential interaction be not know . 
caution should be use when such drug be co-administered . 
concurrent ingestion of drug0 -lrb- 0 ml of drug0 contain drug0 , drug0 , and drug0 -rrb- do not significantly affect the exposure of drug0 or drug0 .
