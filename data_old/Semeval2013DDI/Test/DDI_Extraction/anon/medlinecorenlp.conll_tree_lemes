protective effect of drug1 and drug2 against the acute toxicity of diepoxybutane to human lymphocyte . 
the biotransformation and oxidative stress may contribute to 1,2:3,4 - diepoxybutane -lrb- deb -rrb- - induce toxicity to human lymphocyte of Fanconi Anemia -lrb- FA -rrb- patient . 
thus , the identification of putative inhibitor of bioactivation , as well as the determination of the protective role of oxidant defens , on deb-induced toxicity , can help to understand what be fail in fa cell . 
in the present work we study the contribution of several biochemical pathway for deb-induced acute toxicity in human lymphocyte suspension , by use inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase , inhibitor of protective enzyme as glutathione s-transferase and catalase , the depletion of glutathione -lrb- gsh -rrb- , and the inhibition of protein synthesis ; 
and a variety of putative protective compound , include antioxidant , and mitochondrial protective agent . 
the present study report two novel finding : -lrb- i -rrb- it be clearly evidence , for the first time , that the acute exposure of freshly isolate human lymphocyte to DEB result in severe gsh depletion and loss of atp , follow by cell death ; 
-lrb- ii -rrb- drug1 elicit a significant protective effect on deb induce toxicity , which be potentiate by drug2 . 
collectively , these finding contribute to increase we knowledge of deb-induce toxicity and will be very useful when apply in study with lymphocyte from fa patient , in order to find out a protective agent against spontaneous and deb-induced chromosome instability . 
metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist protect dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuron from degeneration in drug1 - treat monkey . 
Degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and of noradrenergic neuron in the locus coeruleus be important pathological feature of Parkinson 's disease . 
there be a urgent need to develop therapy that slow down the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson 's disease . 
in the present study , we test whether the highly specific metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist , drug1 , reduce dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss in monkey render parkinsonian by chronic treatment with low dose of drug2 . 
Weekly intramuscular drug1 injection -lrb- 0.2-0 .5 mg/kg body weight -rrb- , in combination with daily administration of drug2 or vehicle , be perform until the development of parkinsonian motor symptom in either of the two experimental group -lrb- drug3 / drug4 versus drug5 / vehicle -rrb- . 
after 21 week of drug1 treatment , all drug2 / vehicle-treated animal display parkinsonian symptom , whereas none of the drug3 / drug4 - treat monkey be significantly affect . 
these behavioural observation be consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter imaging datum , and with post-mortem stereological count of midbrain dopaminergic neuron , as well as striatal intensity measurement of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity , which be all significantly higher in drug1 / drug2 - treat animal than in drug3 / vehicle-treated monkey . 
the drug1 treatment also have a significant effect on the drug2 - induced loss of norepinephrine neuron in the locus coeruleus and adjoining a5 and a7 noradrenaline cell group . 
in drug1 / vehicle-treated animal , almost 40 % loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neuron be find in locus coeruleus/a5/a7 noradrenaline cell group , whereas the extent of neuronal loss be lower than 15 % of control value in drug2 / drug3 - treat monkey . 
we datum demonstrate that chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist , drug1 , significantly reduce drug2 toxicity towards dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell group in non-human primate . 
this suggest that the use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist may be a useful strategy to reduce degeneration of catecholaminergic neuron in Parkinson 's disease . 
in vitro activity of drug1 combine with drug2 against clinical isolate of drug3 - resistant staphylococcus aureus . 
this study aim to evaluate the in vitro activity of drug1 combine with drug2 against isolate of drug3 - resistant staphylococcus aureus -lrb- mrsa -rrb- .

drug1 enhance drug2 - mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by up-regulation of cell surface her2 expression . 
although it be previously report that drug1 combine with drug2 improve the progression-free survival rate compare with drug3 alone for patient with drug4 - refractory her2-positive metastatic breast cancer , the mechanism be purported to be a antiproliferative effect relate to the synergism of these two agent . 
we evaluate how drug1 interact with drug2 in her2-positive breast cancer , with a particular focus on drug3 - mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity -lrb- adcc -rrb- . 
in a in vitro assay , drug1 induce her2 expression at the cell surface of her2-positive breast cancer cell line , lead to the enhancement of drug2 - mediate adcc . 
furthermore , we present a case report in which a second drug1 treatment follow drug2 result in the marked shrinkage of multiple metastatic tumor in her2-positive breast cancer . 
drug1 may have the potential to convert drug2 - refractory to drug3 - sensitive tumor in her2-positive breast cancer by up-regulation of the cell surface expression of her2 . 
improve parathyroid hormone control by drug1 be associate with reduction in drug2 requirement in patient with end-stage renal disease . 
uncontrolled hy-per-parathyroidism cause bone marrow fibrosis , lead to drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- resistance . 
medical treatment with drug1 be effective in reduce plasma parathyroid hormone -lrb- pth -rrb- level , but its effect on drug2 dosing be unknown . 
method and aim : we conduct a retrospective cohort study of 40 end-stage renal disease -lrb- esrd -rrb- patient -lrb- age : 55 14 ; mean sd ; 21 : male -rrb- who have at least 12 month of drug1 therapy . 
the distribution of renal replacement therapy be : 14 peritoneal dialysis , 18 conventional hemodialysis and 8 nocturnal hemodialysis . 
Standard dialysis related biochemical index and medication use be record . 
the primary objective of the study be to ascertain the difference in drug1 responsiveness before and after 12 month of drug2 therapy . 
we secondary objective be to determine if there be a relationship between the change in pth and drug1 requirement . 
overall , pth level decrease from 197.5 -lrb- 151.8 ; 249.2 -rrb- to 66.1 -lrb- 41.2 ; 136.5 -rrb- -lrb- median -lrb- 25th ; 75th percentile -rrb- -rrb- pmol/l ; 
p & lt ; 
0.001 . 
drug1 dose increase from 30.0 6 to 63 25 mg/day , p < 
0.05 . 
hemoglobin remain unchanged -lrb- 116 13 to 116 13 g/l -rrb- , while drug1 requirement decrease from 40 -lrb- 20 ; 60 -rrb- to 24 -lrb- 19 ; 59 -rrb- g/week , p = 0.02 . 
the remainder of the dialysis-related biochemistry -lrb- electrolyte , calcium , phosphate , iron status -rrb- and vitamin d use remain unchanged . 
a reduction in pth level of greater than 30 % be experience by 82.5 % -lrb- 33/40 -rrb- of we cohort .

drug1 do not inhibit the absorption of 5 milligram of drug2 or drug3 at dose less than 800 milligram in nonpregnant woman . 
drug1 be the only known component in the diet that may affect absorption of both drug2 and drug3 . 
however , the evidence for a drug1 effect on drug2 absorption mainly come from study that do not isolate the effect of drug3 from that of other dietary component , because it be detect in single-meal study . 
we objective be to establish potential effect of drug1 on absorption of drug2 and drug3 and the dose response for this effect in the absence of a meal . 
fifty-four healthy , nonpregnant woman be select to participate in 4 drug1 absorption study use iron radioactive tracer . 
we evaluate the effect of drug1 dose between 200 and 1500 mg on absorption of 5 mg drug2 -lrb- as drug3 -rrb- . 
we also evaluate the effect of drug1 dose between 200 and 800 mg on absorption of 5 mg drug2 -lsb- as concentrated rbc -lrb- crbc -rrb- -rsb- . 
drug1 be administer as drug2 in all study and drug3 be ingest on a empty stomach . 
drug1 dose 1000 mg diminish drug2 absorption by a average of 49.6 % . 
a drug1 dose of 800 mg diminish absorption of 5 mg drug2 by 37.7 % . 
in conclusion , we demonstrate a isolate effect of drug1 -lrb- as chloride -rrb- on absorption of 5 mg of iron provide as drug2 -lrb- as sulfate -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- as crbc -rrb- drug3 . 
this effect be observe at dose higher than previously report from single-meal study , start at ~ 800 mg of drug1 . 
synergistic interaction between drug1 and drug2 be sequence dependent in human non-small lung cancer with egfr tkis-resistant mutation . 
previous study have demonstrate that drug1 have the anti-tumor activity in human non-small cell lung cancer -lrb- nsclc -rrb- . 
this study be aim to investigate the efficacy of single use of drug1 and that of concurrent or sequential administration of drug2 and drug3 in nsclc cell line that be resistant to egfr tki . 
nsclc cell line with egfr t790m mutation and k-ras mutation be expose to either drug1 or drug2 or both base on various sequential administration . 
after exposure , the cell viability be measure by MTT assay , cell cycle distribution be analyze by flow cytometry , and alteration in signaling pathway be determine by immunoblotting . 
drug1 exhibit dose-dependent growth inhibition in nsclc cell line and arrest cell cycle at g1 phase , whereas drug2 arrest at s phase . 
although single or concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 have some anti-proliferative effect , the sequential administration of both drug remarkably enhance anti-tumor activity . 
when cell be expose to drug1 follow by drug2 , synergism be observe . 
the molecular basis of this synergism be that the signaling pathway that be initially activate by drug1 exposure be efficiently suppress by the subsequent exposure to drug2 . 
in contrast , the reverse of this sequential administration result in antagonism , which may be due to differential effect on cell cycle arrest . 
drug1 as a single agent exhibit anti-proliferative effect in vitro in nsclc cell line with egfr t790m and k-ras mutation but the sequential administration of drug2 follow by drug3 be superior to drug4 follow by drug5 and concurrent administration . 
determinant of sensitivity to drug1 induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cell . 
the drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- , one of s-adenosylhomocysteine -lrb- adohcy -rrb- hydrolase inhibitor , have show antitumor activity in a broad range of solid tumor and acute myeloid leukemia . 
here , we examine its effect on multiple myeloma -lrb- mm -rrb- cell and find that , at 500 nm , it potently inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in 2 of 8 mm cell line . 
rna from un-treated and drug1 treated cell be profile by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and gene with a significant change in gene expression be determine by significance analysis of microarray -lrb- sam -rrb- testing . 
alox5 be the most down-regulate gene -lrb- 5.8-fold -rrb- in sensitive cell and be express at low level in resistant cell . 
the result be corroborate by quantitative rt-pcr . 
western-blot analysis indicate alox5 be highly express only in sensitive cell line h929 and greatly decrease upon drug1 treatment . 
ectopic expression of alox5 reduce sensitivity to drug1 in h929 cell . 
furthermore , down-regulation of alox5 by rna interference could also induce apoptosis in h929 . 
gene expression analysis on mm patient dataset indicate alox5 expression be significantly higher in mm patient compare to normal plasma cell . 
we also find that bcl-2 be overexpress in drug1 insensitive cell , and cotreatment with drug2 and drug3 , a bcl-2 family inhibitor , synergistically inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of drug4 insensitive mm cell . 
take together , this study show one of mechanism of the drug1 efficacy on mm correlate with its ability to down-regulate the alox5 level . 
in addition , drug1 insensitivity might be associate with overexpression of bcl-2 , and the combination of drug2 and drug3 could synergistically induce apoptosis . 
these result suggest that drug1 may be exploit therapeutically for a subset of mm .

effect of cyp inhibitor on drug1 metabolism and toxicity in rat liver slice . 
we present a comprehensive in vitro approach to assess metabolism-mediated hepatotoxicity use male sprague-dawley rat liver slice incubate with the well characterize hepatotoxicant , drug1 , and inhibitor of cytochrome p450 -lrb- cyp -rrb- enzyme . 
this approach combine liquid chromatography mass spectrometry -lrb- lc ms -rrb- detection method with multiple toxicity endpoint to enable identification of critical metabolic pathway for hepatotoxicity . 
the incubation be perform in the absence and presence of the non-specific cyp inhibitor , drug1 -lrb- drug2 -rrb- and isoform-specific inhibitor . 
the metabolite profile of drug1 in rat liver slice share some feature of the in vivo profile , but also have a major difference in that epoxide dihydrodiol hydrolysis product be not observe to a measurable extent . 
as example of we liver slice metabolite identification procedure , a minor glutathione adduct and previously unreported 7-o-desmethyl and glucuronidate metabolite of drug1 be report . 
drug1 induce hepatocellular necrosis in a dose - and time-dependent manner . 
drug1 decrease the toxicity of drug2 , increase exposure to parent compound , and decrease metabolite level in a dose-dependent manner . 
of the isoform-specific cyp inhibitor test for a effect on the drug1 metabolite profile , only drug2 be noticeably effective , indicate a role of cyp 2a6 , 2c9 , 2cl9 , and 2e1 . 
with respect to toxicity , the order of cyp inhibitor effectiveness be drug1 > drug2 ~ drug3 > drug4 . 
drug1 and drug2 have no effect , while drug3 appear to augment drug4 toxicity . 
these result suggest that rat liver slice do not reproduce the report in vivo biotransformation of drug1 and therefore may not be a appropriate model for drug2 metabolism . 
however , these result provide a example of how small molecule manipulation of cyp activity in a in vitro model can be use to confirm metabolism-mediated toxicity .

it be know to possess both anticancer and antibacterial activity . 
such observation prompt to investigate the ability of drug1 as a potent drug against multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa . 
a total of 12 test P. 
aeruginosa strain isolate from various hospital be test for they resistance against many drug1 , most of which be apply in the treatment of P. 
aeruginosa infection . 
result reveal that the strain be resistant to many drug at high level , only drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 show resistance at comparatively lower level . 
follow multiple experimentation it be observe that drug1 be also antimicrobic against all the strain at comparable level . 
distinct and statistically significant synergism be observe between drug1 and drug2 by disc diffusion test when compare with they individual effect . 
the fractional inhibitory concentration index of this combination evaluate by checkerboard analysis , be 0.5 , which confirm synergism between the pair . 
synergism be also note when drug1 be combine with drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 failure in a hiv-positive woman on drug2 therapy result in two ectopic pregnancy . 
since its introduction in 1999 , drug1 remain one of the preferred contraceptive choice for many woman as it offer a highly effective means of long-term contraception for three year that do not rely on adherence . 
like all drug1 , certain hepatic enzyme-inducing drug may reduce its efficacy . 
we present a interesting case of a hiv-positive woman on drug1 therapy have tubal pregnancy on two separate occasion with drug2 in place . 
drug1 and cyp 2d6 inhibitor : caution . 
drug1 , a drug2 , be the standard hormone treatment for breast cancer . 
it be extensively transform into its active metabolite by the cytochrome p450 enzyme system , especially into drug1 by isoenzyme cyp 2d6 . 
co-administration of drug1 with isoenzyme cyp 2d6 inhibitor reduce this metabolism . 
drug1 inhibit isoenzyme cyp 2d6 . 
drug1 and drug2 reduce the plasma concentration of drug3 by about 50 % . 
two epidemiological study involve about 3700 woman have show a link between the use of drug1 and a increase frequency of breast cancer recurrence . 
other study , with a lower level of evidence , be less convincing . 
study of other isoenzyme cyp 2d6 inhibitor show no increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence , but they lack statistical power . 
it be better to avoid prescribe isoenzyme cyp 2d6 inhibitor to woman treat with drug1 for breast cancer , especially drug2 such as drug3 and drug4 . 
depression do not always require drug1 therapy , and drug2 have no proven preventive impact on hot flush link to the menopause . 
if in certain case , a drug1 be consider necessary , it may be advisable to replace drug2 with drug3 . 
phase i trial of drug1 and drug2 in patient with relapse multiple myeloma : evidence for drug3 - drug4 interaction via p-glycoprotein . 
multiple myeloma -lrb- mm -rrb- be a incurable plasma-cell neoplasm for which most treatment involve a therapeutic agent combine with drug1 . 
the preclinical combination of drug1 with the mtor inhibitor drug2 have display synergy in vitro and represent a novel combination in mm . 
in vivo cyp3a activity be significantly lower in drug1 - treat as compare with drug2 - treat renal allograft recipient . 
in vitro study have identify drug1 and drug2 as cyp3a inhibitor . 
in the current study in renal allograft recipient , we use intravenously and orally administer drug1 as a drug probe to assess whether the study drug at dose that be generally use in clinical practice have differential effect on in vivo hepatic and first-pass cyp3a activity . 
systemic and apparent oral drug1 clearance be 24 % -lrb- 269 73 vs. 354 102 ml/min , p = 0.022 -rrb- and 31 % -lrb- 479 190 vs. 688 265 ml/min , p = 0.013 -rrb- , respectively , lower in drug2 - treated patient -lrb- n = 20 -rrb- than in match drug3 - treated patient -lrb- n = 20 -rrb- . 
the latter display drug1 clearance similar to those in two larger cohort of nonmatched drug2 - treated patient -lrb- n = 58 and n = 80 -rrb- and to those receive a drug3 - free regimen -lrb- n = 6 -rrb- . 
this imply that in vivo hepatic and first-pass cyp3a activity be significantly lower in patient receive drug1 than in those receive drug2 , indicate that , at the dose generally use in clinical practice , drug3 be the stronger of the two with respect to cyp3a inhibition . 
this observation have important implication in the context of drug-drug interaction in transplant recipient . 
-lsb- influence of drug1 and drug2 on mptp-evoked behavior violation in c57bl/6 mouse -rsb- . 
the effect of drug1 drug2 -lsb- drug3 -rsb- -lrb- 10 mg/kg , p. o. -rrb- 
and/or drug1 drug2 -lrb- 100 mg/kg , p. o. -rrb- , as well as that of neurotoxin drug3 -lrb- drug4 -rrb- -lrb- 4 x 20 mg/kg , i. p. -rrb- 
be study in elevated plus maze test on c57bl/6 mouse . 
on second day after injection , drug1 decrease the locomot or activity in comparison to saline . 
acute administration of drug1 or drug2 fail to influence locomotion in mouse , while they combination normalize motor activity . 
the result obtain confirm the role of inflammatory process in parkinsonism and suggest expediency of combined pharmacotherapy of neurodegenerative disease . 
exposure to oral drug1 be unaffected by drug2 but greatly increase by drug3 . 
this study examine drug-drug interaction of oral drug1 with the cytochrome p450 -lrb- cyp -rrb- 2b6 inhibitor drug2 and the cyp3a inhibitor drug3 . 
in this randomize , blind , crossover study , 11 healthy volunteer ingest 0.2 mg/kg drug1 after pretreatment with oral drug2 -lrb- 250 mg twice daily -rrb- , drug3 -lrb- 200 mg once daily -rrb- , or placebo in 6-day treatment period at interval of 4 week . 
drug1 treatment increase the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolate to infinity -lrb- auc -lrb- 0 - -rrb- -rrb- of oral drug2 by 2.4-fold , whereas drug3 treatment do not increase the exposure to drug4 . 
the ratio of drug1 auc -lrb- 0 - -rrb- to drug2 auc -lrb- 0 - -rrb- be significantly decrease in the drug3 -lrb- p & lt ; 0.001 -rrb- drug4 zole phase -lrb- p = 0.006 -rrb- as compare to placebo . 
in the drug1 and drug2 phase , the area under the effect-time curve -lrb- self-reported drowsiness and performance -rrb- be significantly higher than those in the placebo phase -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- . 
the finding suggest that the dosage of drug1 should be reduce in patient receive drug2 . 
interaction of drug1 with different drug2 be antagonistic in breast but not in other cancer cell . 
drug1 , a inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 , be be investigate for enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy in cancer clinical trial . 
this study investigate the ability of drug1 to sensitize cell from different origin to several drug2 . 
the effect of the drug 's mechanism of action and sequence of administration be also investigate . 
the sensitivity , cell cycle , apoptosis and dna damage of five different cancer cell line -lrb- hela , hct116 , hepg2 , mcf7 and u251 -rrb- to drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 drug5 follow different incubation schedule be analyze . 
we find antagonism between drug1 and the four drug in the breast cancer cell mcf7 follow all incubation schedule and between drug2 and drug3 in all cell line except for two combination in hct116 cell . 
drug1 with the other three drug in the remain four cell line result in variable interaction . 
mechanistic investigation reveal that drug1 exert different molecular effect in different cell . 
in some line , it abrogate the drug-induced g2/m arrest enhance pre-mature entry into mitosis with damaged dna thus increase apoptosis and result in synergism . 
in other cell , it enhance drug-induced g2/m arrest allow time to repair drug-induced dna damage before entry into mitosis and decrease cell death result in antagonism . 
in some synergistic combination , celecoxib-induced abrogation of g2/m arrest be not associate with apoptosis but permanent arrest in g1 phase . 
these result , if confirm in-vivo , indicate that drug1 be not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with drug2 for other cancer . 
moreover , combination of drug1 with other drug should be tailor to the tumor type , drug and administration schedule . 
drug1 - drug2 interaction and associate gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case-control study . 
bleeding be the most common and worrisome adverse effect of drug1 therapy . 
one of the factor that might increase bleeding risk be initiation of interact drug that potentiate drug1 . 
we seek to evaluate whether initiation of a drug1 increase the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in drug2 user . 
Medicaid claim datum -lrb- 1999-2005 -rrb- be use to perform a observational case-control study nested within person-time expose to drug1 in those 18 year . 
in total , 430,455 drug1 user contribute 407,370 person-year of drug2 use . 
the incidence rate of hospitalization for gi bleeding among drug1 user be 4.48 per 100 person-year -lrb- 95 % ci , 4.42-4 .55 -rrb- . 
each gastrointestinal bleeding case be match to 50 control base on index date and state . 
drug1 user have a increase odds ratio of gastrointestinal bleeding upon initiation of drug2 -lrb- or = 1.73 -lsb- 95 % ci , 1.25-2 .38 -rsb- -rrb- , drug3 -lrb- or = 1.63 -lsb- 95 % ci , 1.11-2 .38 -rsb- -rrb- , drug4 -lrb- or = 1.64 -lsb- 95 % ci , 1.27-2 .12 -rsb- -rrb- , drug5 -lrb- or = 1.47 -lsb- 95 % ci , 1.02-2 .11 -rsb- -rrb- . 
also drug1 , which be not believe to interact with drug2 , increase the risk of gi bleeding -lrb- or = 1.75 -lsb- 95 % ci , 1.30-2 .35 -rsb- -rrb- . 
drug1 user who initiate drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 have a increase risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding . 
however , the elevated risk with drug1 suggest that a drug-drug interaction may not have be responsible for all of the observe increase risk . 
drug1 enhance the antinociceptive effect of drug2 in mouse . 
drug1 , a highly selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist , be recently introduce into clinical practice for its sedative and analgesic property . 
the purpose of this study be to evaluate whether the psychostimulant drug drug1 have any effect on drug2 - induce antinociception and locomotor inhibitor activity in mouse in acute application . 
in both sex of swiss albino mouse ; 
antinociception be assess with hot-plate test and the locomotor , exploratory activity be assess with hole open field test . 
the animal be receive ; 
saline + saline , drug1 -lrb- 10 mg/kg -rrb- + saline , saline + drug2 -lrb- 15 g/kg -rrb- and drug3 -lrb- 10 mg/kg -rrb- + drug4 -lrb- 15 g/kg -rrb- , intraperitoneally , 30 min before hot plate or hole open field test . 
in the hot plate test in mouse , co-administration of 15 g/kg drug1 with 10 mg/kg drug2 intraperitoneally not only enhance , but also prolong the duration of antinociception induce by drug3 . 
at the same time , the locomotor inhibitory effect of drug1 be counteract by drug2 . 
we conclude that the combined administration of drug1 with drug2 may have beneficial effect in the treatment of pain without cause sedation , which limit the use of drug3 as a drug4 in human . 
interaction study of drug1 and drug2 with co-administered drug . 
drug1 and drug2 be drug3 use in treat urinary and respiratory tract infection . 
drug1 be know to have interaction with drug that be active in gastro intestinal tract . 
be drug1 and lomefloxacin drug2 the interaction study of be carry out with drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 . 
the interaction be study at neutral , acidic and basic condition both at room temperature and 37 c . 
the effect of dissolution medium simulate various body environment with response to ph have be examine in order to elucidate the interaction . 
the response of drug1 and drug2 after interaction with co-administered drug at different condition and temperature be note use a Shimadzu hplc system with pda detector . 
it be see that interaction of these drug1 be more at 37 c than at room temperature . 
drug1 and drug2 react faster with drug3 and drug4 in acidic media whereas with drug5 in basic media and drug6 in neutral media . 
the study ensure the interaction of drug1 with select class of drug . 
in order to achieve the effective therapeutic effect appropriate time interval between administration of drug be essential .
