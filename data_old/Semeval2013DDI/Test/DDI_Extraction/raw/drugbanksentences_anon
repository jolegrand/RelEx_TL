drug1 : Concomitant drug2 administration decreased the mean AUC of total drug3 approximately 55%. 	
The incremental LDL-C reduction due to adding drug1 to drug2 may be reduced by this interaction. 	
drug1 : The safety and effectiveness of drug2 administered with drug3 have not been established. 	
 drug1 may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. 	
In a preclinical study in dogs, drug1 increased cholesterol in the gallbladder bile. 	
Co-administration of drug1 with drug2 is not recommended until use in patients is studied. 	
drug1 : In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant drug2 administration increased total drug3 concentrations approximately 1.5-fold. 	
drug1 : In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant drug2 administration increased total drug3 concentrations approximately 1.7-fold. 	
drug1 : No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were seen when drug2 was co-administered with drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or drug7 . 	
drug1 : The total drug2 level increased 12-fold in one renal transplant patient receiving multiple medications, including drug3 . 	
Patients who take both drug1 and drug2 should be carefully monitored. 	
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with drug1 was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (males) and 500 mg/kg/day (females) (~20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total drug2 ). 	
A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with drug1 was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (>150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total drug2 ). 	
There were no statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in drug-treated rats or mice. 	
No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation. 	
No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation. 	
In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. 	
In oral (gavage) fertility studies of drug1 conducted in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male or female rats (~7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total drug2 ). 	
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category: C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of drug1 in pregnant women. 	
 drug1 should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. 	
In oral (gavage) embryo-fetal development studies of drug1 conducted in rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there was no evidence of embryolethal effects at the doses tested (250, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day). 	
In rats, increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings (extra pair of thoracic ribs, unossified cervical vertebral centra, shortened ribs) were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (~10 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total drug1 ). 	
In rabbits treated with drug1 , an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total drug2 ). 	
 drug1 crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses. 	
Multiple dose studies of drug1 given in combination with drug2 ( drug3 ) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher drug4 and statin exposures. 	
Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy. 	
All drug1 are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women. 	
When drug1 is administered with an drug2 in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the drug3 . 	
Labor and Delivery The effects of drug1 on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. 	
Nursing Mothers In rat studies, exposure to total drug1 in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma. 	
It is not known whether drug1 is excreted into human breast milk; 	
therefore, drug1 should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant. 	
Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of drug1 in adolescents (10 to 18 years) have been shown to be similar to that in adults. 	
Treatment experience with drug1 in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients (9 to 17 years) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients (11 to 17 years) in the HoFH study. 	
Treatment with drug1 in children (&lt;10 years) is not recommended. 	
Geriatric Use Of the patients who received drug1 in clinical studies, 948 were 65 and older (this included 206 who were 75 and older). 	
The effectiveness and safety of drug1 were similar between these patients and younger subjects. 	
Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.	
Interaction with drug1 : Although drug2 does not itself cause orthostatic hypotension, its administration to patients already receiving drug3 can result in profound orthostatic effects. 	
If at all possible drug1 should be discontinued well before drug2 is begun. 	
Where this is not possible, drug1 therapy should be started in the hospital and the patient should remain institutionalized until severe orthostatic effects are no longer present or the patient has learned to avoid activities that provoke them.	
In a study in which 34 different drugs were tested, therapeutically relevant concentrations of drug1 , drug2 and drug3 displaced protein-bound drug4 in fresh human serum to a small but significant extent. 	
Because of the extremely high binding of drug1 to plasma proteins, these small decreases in binding could cause substantial increases in free drug levels in plasma which could result in potentiation of drug toxicity. 	
Therefore, caution should be used in administering drug1 ( drug2 injection) to patients receiving these other agents. 	
There was no change in the plasma kinetics of drug1 when coadministered with drug2 . 	
However, the plasma clearance of drug1 was slightly increased. 	
An increase in intracellular levels of drug1 was observed in vitro in the presence of drug2 .	
 drug1 antagonize the uricosuric action of . drugs used to treat gout. 	
drug1 AND OTHER drug2 WILL BE ADDITIVE TO drug3 AND MAY INCREASE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF drug4 TO TOXIC LEVELS. 	
Drugs and foods that raise urine pH will increase renal clearance and urinary excretion of drug1 , thus lowering plasma levels; 	
acidifying drugs or foods will decrease urinary excretion and increase plasma levels. 	
drug1 given concomitantly with drug2 may predispose to systemic bleeding. 	
drug1 may enhance the hypoglycemic effect of oral drug2 of the sulfonylurea class. 	
drug1 competes with a number of drugs for protein binding sites, notably drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and possibly drug11 . 	
Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 competes with thyroid hormone for binding to plasma proteins, which may be reflected in a depressed plasma T4 value in some patients; 	
thyroid function and basal metabolism are unaffected.	
In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain drug1 , primarily drug2 , an increased incidence of thrombopenia with purpura has been reported. 	
It has been reported that drug1 may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the drug2 drug3 . 	
This interaction should be kept in mind when drug1 is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed. 	
drug1 may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of drug2 . 	
At a 1.6-g dose, drug1 produced a slight but significant increase in the half-life of drug2 but did not produce a corresponding decrease in the metabolic clearance rate. 	
When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive drug1 effect. 	
drug1 can also displace drug2 from plasma protein-binding sites, thus increasing free drug3 concentrations. 	
The presence of drug1 may interfere with the Jaff    alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.	
The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important. 	
Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 ; 	
therefore, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. 	
convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 . 	
Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 may increase the clearance of drug4 and may require increased in drug5 dose to achieve the desired response. 	
Drugs such as drug1 and drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 and thus decrease its clearance. 	
Therefore, the dose of drug1 should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. 	
drug1 may increase the clearance of chronic high dose drug2 . 	
This could lead to decreased drug1 serum levels or increase the risk of drug2 toxicity when drug3 is withdrawn. 	
drug1 should be used cautiously in conjunction with drug2 in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. 	
The effect of drug1 on oral drug2 is variable. 	
There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of drug1 when given concurrently with drug2 . 	
Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.	
Patients receiving drug1 and drug2 generally should not be treated with drug3 .  	
The action of drug1 may be potentiated by anesthesia, other drug2 and drug3 .	
In clinical studies, the concurrent administration of the drug1 inhaler and other drugs commonly used in the treatment of asthma was not associated with any unusual adverse events. 	
However, drug1 , a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, may increase plasma levels of drug2 during concomitant dosing.	
No formal drug interaction studies between drug1 and other drugs have been performed. 	
Drugs such as drug1 may potentiate the release of neutrophils; 	
patients receiving drug1 and drug2 should have more frequent monitoring of neutrophil counts.	
drug1 drug2 may increase sensitivity to oral drug3 . 	
Dosage of the drug1 may have to be decreased in order to maintain desired prothrombin time. 	
Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when drug1 are started or stopped. 	
drug1 : A multidose study of drug2 , given as 5 or 10 mg BID in 15 healthy subjects concurrently treated with drug3 , resulted in a mean increase in drug4 half-life from 26 to 48 hours and AUC from 4.55 to 12.08 ng*hr/mL: similar increases in drug5 half-life and AUC were also detected. 	
Microscopic hematuria (9/15) and gingival bleeding (1/15) were also observed. 	
A 5.5-fold decrease in the mean drug1 dose from 6.13 mg/day to 1.13 mg/day (approximately 80-85% reduction of drug2 dose), was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1.5. 	
When drug1 therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with drug2 , the INR or prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of drug3 adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved. 	
Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the drug1 dosage if indicated are recommended when the drug2 dose is changed or discontinued. 	
Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of occult bleeding. 	
Oral drug1 drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of oral drug3 . 	
drug1 or drug2 In patients with edema, concomitant administration with drug3 or drug4 may increase the edema. 	
Drug/Laboratory test interactions drug1 may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. 	
Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged. 	
In addition, a decrease in PBI and radioactive iodine uptake may occur.    	
The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of drug1 : drug2 , drug3 (e.g., drug4 ), drug5 , drug6 (e.g., drug7 ), drug8 , drug9 , drug10 (e.g., drug11 ), drug12 and drug13 , drug14 , drug15 , and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. 	
drug1 antagonize the effects of drug2 . 	
drug1 in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as drug2 . 	
drug1 may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of drug2 ; 	
increased serum drug1 concentrations may result. 	
drug1 may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as drug2 . 	
Because drug1 may interfere with the absorption of drug2 , simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. 	
The inhibiting effects of drug1 on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion.	
Since drug1 ( drug2 ) may interact with concurrently administered drug3 , periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary (eg drug4 may increase the plasma concentrations of drug5 and drug6 ).	
drug1 : drug2 and probably other drug3 given concomitantly with drug4 can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes. 	
Other drug1 : When drug2 Tablets are used with other drug3 , care must be taken, especially during initial therapy. 	
Dosage adjustments of other drug1 may be necessary. 	
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 : The hypotensive effects of these drugs may be potentiated by the volume contraction that may be associated with drug4 therapy. 	
drug1 : drug2 -induced hypokalemia can increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to drug3 . 	
Serious arrhythmias can result. 	
drug1 or drug2 : May increase the risk of hypokalemia and increase salt and water retention. 	
drug1 : Serum drug2 levels may increase. 	
drug1 : drug2 -induced hypokalemia may enhance neuromuscular blocking effects of drug3 (such as drug4 ) the most serious effect would be respiratory depression which could proceed to apnea. 	
Accordingly, it may be advisable to discontinue drug1 Tablets three days before elective surgery. 	
drug1 and Other drug2 : May decrease the antihypertensive effects of drug3 Tablets. 	
drug1 : drug2 may decrease arterial responsiveness to drug3 , but this diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. 	
drug1 : Efficacy may be decreased due to urinary alkalizing effect of drug2 . 	
drug1 : drug2 , as well as other drug3 , may affect the hypoprothrombinemic response to drug4 ; 	
dosage adjustments may be necessary.	
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 resulted in increased plasma drug3 concentrations (57%), increased plasma bismuth trough concentrations (48%), and increased drug4 plasma concentrations (31%). 	
Coadministration with drug1 results in a slight decrease in the rate of drug2 absorption that is clinically unimportant. 	
Coadministration with a high dose of drug1 (170 mEq) results in a 28% decrease in plasma concentrations of drug2 and may decrease plasma concentrations of bismuth from drug3 . 	
These effects are clinically insignificant. 	
For information on drug interactions associated with drug1 , refer to the drug2 package insert.	
drug1 should be used with caution in patients receiving other local drug2 or agents structurally related to drug3 , since the toxic effects of these drugs are additive. 	
Cytochrome P4501A2 is involved in the formation of drug1 , the major metabolite. 	
In vivo, the plasma clearance of drug1 was reduced by 70% during coadministration of drug2 (25 mg bid for 2 days), a selective and potent CYP1A2 inhibitor. 	
Thus strong inhibitors of cytochrome P4501A2, such as drug1 , given concomitantly during administration of drug2 , can interact with drug3 leading to increased drug4 plasma levels. 	
Caution should be exercised when CYP1A2 inhibitors are coadministered. 	
Possible interactions with drugs known to be metabolized by CYP1A2 via competitive inhibition such as drug1 and drug2 may also occur. 	
Coadministration of a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, drug1 (100 mg bid for 2 days with drug2 infusion administered 1 hour after drug3 ) caused a 15% reduction in in-vivo plasma clearance of drug4 .	
Additives may be incompatible; 	
drug1 and drug2 are incompatible with drug3 solution. 	
The addition of drug1 to parenteral solutions containing drug2 should be avoided, except where compatibility has been previously established. 	
Precipitation or haze may result from sodium bicarbonate-calcium admixtures. 	
NOTE: Do not use the injection if it contains precipitate. 	
Additives may be incompatible. 	
Consult with pharmacist, if available. 	
When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store.	
Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of drug1 ( drug2 ) on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: drug3 is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases. 	
Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. 	
Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, or CYP2C19. 	
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between drug1 and drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 in studies in healthy volunteers. 	
The elevation of prothrombin time induced by drug1 is not affected by administration of drug2 . 	
Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of drug1 : Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of drug2 . 	
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of drug1 is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 	
Population PK analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of drug1 were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as drug2 (n=77), drug3 (n=72), drug4 (n=75), drug5 (n=21), drug6 (n=79), drug7 (n=70), drug8 (n=177), drug9 (n=35), and drug10 (n=15). 	
Use with drug1 : Because of their mechanism of action, drug2 have the potential to interfere with the activity of drug3 . 	
Use with drug1 and Other drug2 : A synergistic effect may be expected when drug3 are given concurrently with drug4 , similar drug5 or drug6 such as drug7 .	
drug1 Reports suggest that drug2 may diminish the antihypertensive effect of drug3 . 	
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking drug1 concomitantly with drug2 . 	
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of drug3 . 	
The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; 	
however, as with other drug1 , concomitant administration of drug2 and drug3 is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects. 	
Concomitant administration of low-dose drug1 with drug2 may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of drug3 alone. 	
drug1 is not a substitute for drug2 for cardiovascular prophylaxis. 	
drug1 : Pretreatment for four days with drug2 significantly increased the clearance of drug3 by 50%. 	
This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC. 	
This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for drug1 in the gastrointestinal tract. 	
The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established. 	
drug1 : Concomitant administration of 200 mg drug2 QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg drug3 . 	
drug1 : drug2 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of drug3 after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses. 	
In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 . 	
drug1 : Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that drug2 can reduce the natriuretic effect of drug3 and drug4 in some patients. 	
This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. 	
Studies with drug1 agents and drug2 have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect. 	
drug1 : single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of drug2 . 	
Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with drug1 and drug2 , patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. 	
drug1 : In clinical trials, drug2 have produced an elevation of plasma drug3 levels and a reduction in renal drug4 clearance. 	
In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose drug1 concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving drug2 doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with drug3 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving drug4 alone. 	
These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by drug1 . 	
Patients on drug1 treatment should be closely monitored when drug2 is introduced or withdrawn. 	
drug1 : A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of drug2 on the pharmacokinetics of drug3 taken once weekly. 	
drug1 did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of drug2 . 	
In vitro, drug1 did not displace drug2 from its human serum binding sites. 	
drug1 : Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing drug2 therapy in patients receiving drug3 or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding. 	
The effect of drug1 on the anticoagulant effect of drug2 was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of drug3 that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8. 	
In these subjects, drug1 did not alter drug2 pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of drug3 as determined by prothrombin time. 	
However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1. 	
Caution should be used when administering drug1 with drug2 since patients on drug3 may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced.	
drug1 may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of drug2 . 	
drug1 , given at a common clinical dosage, increased the drug2 half-life by 51% and decreased the drug3 metabolic clearance rate by 30%. 	
When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive drug1 effect.	
Excessive glucocorticoid therapy will inhibit the growth-promoting effect of drug1 . 	
Patients with ACTH deficiency should have their drug1 -replacement dose carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth. 	
The use of drug1 in patients with chronic renal insufficiency receiving glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated. 	
Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy may inhibit the growth-promoting effect of drug1 . 	
If drug1 replacement is required, the drug2 dose should be carefully adjusted. 	
There was no evidence in the controlled studies of drug1 s interaction with drugs commonly used in chronic renal insufficiency patients. 	
Limited published data indicate that drug1 treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450) mediated drug2 clearance in man. 	
These data suggest that drug1 administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes (e.g., drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ). 	
Careful monitoring is advisable when drug1 is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes.	
 drug1 may interact with other addictive medications, in that it may increase the likelyhood of addiction and abuse. 	
Concurrent use of drug1 and other drug2 may increase the CNS depressant effects of drug3 or these other medications.	
drug1 may decrease the effectiveness of oral drug2 , certain drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 .	
Caution is recommended when administering drug1 with compounds that are metabolized/eliminated predominantly by the UGT1A1 pathway (e.g. drug2 ). 	
Concomitant treatment with drug1 resulted in a 21% increase in the AUC of drug2 . 	
Caution is recommended when administering drug1 with drug2 . 	
 drug1 inhibits CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 in vitro with Ki values of 6 and 1-2 ?M, respectively. 	
Systemic exposure to substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 is expected to increase when co-administered with drug1 . 	
Caution is recommended when administering substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 with drug1 .	
When administered concomitantly with drug1 , drug2 may enhance or precipitate bradycardia, A.V. 	
block or arrhythmia. 	
The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 ) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of drug6 . Therefore, caution should be used when drug7 is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction. 	
drug1 has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt-retaining steroid therapy (i.e., drug2 ), with or without salt supplementation. 	
The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of drug1 or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with. 	
drug1 . drug2 , such as drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , can antagonize the effects of drug6 . Potential for Drug Interactions: It appears possible, although there is no supporting experimental evidence, that the high renal clearance of drug7 (a base) is due to active tubular secretion by the base-secreting system also responsible for the secretion of such drugs as drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , and drug14 . 	
Thus there may be a potential for drug-drug interactions with these drugs.	
drug1 has been reported to enhance the sedative activity of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 	
Peripheral Neuropathy: Medications known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving drug1 . 	
Oral drug1 : In 10 healthy women, the pharmacokinetic profiles of drug2 and drug3 following administration of a single dose containing 1.0 mg of drug4 and 75    g of drug5 were studied. 	
The results were similar with and without coadministration of drug1 200 mg/day to steady-state levels. 	
Important Non- drug1 Drug Interactions Drugs That Interfere with drug2 : Concomitant use of drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , or certain herbal supplements such as St. 	
drug1 with drug2 may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception and up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies. 	
Therefore, women requiring treatment with one or more of these drugs must use two OTHER effective or highly effective methods of contraception or abstain from heterosexual sexual contact while taking drug1 .    	
drug1 may enhance the effects of drug2 , drug3 and other drug4 .	
drug1 and drug2 increase the effects of drug3 . 	
drug1 may reduce the antihypertensive effects of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and drug5 .	
Interactions between drug1 and other drugs have not been fully evaluated. 	
Drugs which may potentiate the myeloproliferative effects of drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 , should be used with caution.	
The in vitro binding of drug1 to human plasma proteins is unaffected by drug2 , and drug3 does not alter the prothrombin time of normal volunteers. 	
However, increased prothrombin time and bleeding have been reported in patients on concomitant drug1 and drug2 therapy. 	
Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering drug1 to patients on drug2 . 	
In adult diabetic patients under treatment with either drug1 or drug2 there is no change in the clinical effects of either drug3 or the drug4 . 	
Caution should be used if drug1 is administered concomitantly with drug2 . 	
drug1 and other drug2 have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of drug3 in an animal model, possibly enhancing the toxicity of drug4 . 	
Laboratory Tests Because serious GI tract ulceration and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should follow chronically treated patients for the signs and symptoms of ulceration and bleeding and should inform them of the importance of this follow-up.	
An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (such as drug1 ) may increase the AUC of drug2 and an inducer of CYP2C8 (such as drug3 ) may decrease the AUC of drug4 . 	
Therefore, if an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with drug1 , changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based upon clinical response.	
Pharmacokinetic properties of drug1 were not altered by the addition of either drug2 or drug3 or the combination of drug4 and drug5 . 	
No clinically significant changes to drug1 or drug2 pharmacokinetics were observed following concomitant administration of drug3 . 	
drug1 has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of drug2 . 	
drug1 decreases the elimination of drug2 causing an increase in overall exposure . The addition of drug3 has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of drug4 . 	
In a study of 11 HIV-infected patients receiving drug1 -maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily) with 600 mg of drug2 twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral drug3 clearance increased 22% (90% CI 6% to 42%). 	
This alteration will not result in a drug1 dose modification in the majority of patients; 	
however, an increased drug1 dose may be required in a small number of patients.	
Other drug1 should not be used concomitantly with drug2 ( drug3 USP) because they may have additive effects. 	
drug1 should be administered with caution to patients being treated with drug2 or drug3 , since the action of drug4 on the vascular system may be potentiated.	
A study published in 2002 found that drug1 causes a statistically significant increase in plasma clearance of drug2 . 	
In 1984, Drs Rimmer and Richens at the University of Wales reported that administering drug1 with drug2 lowered the serum drug3 concentration in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. 	
The concentration of drug1 falls to 23% within five weeks, according to an experiment published in 1989 by the same two scientists that tried and failed to elucidate the mechanism behind this interaction.	
drug1 may enhance the sedative effects of drug2 including drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , and drug8 . 	
The effects of drug1 , such as drug2 and drug3 may be enhanced by the concomitant administration of drug4 . 	
 drug1 may effect the metabolism of drugs in the liver.	
Interactions between drug1 and other drugs have not been fully evaluated. 	
Caution should be exercised when administering drug1 therapy in combination with other drug2 . 	
 drug1 should not be mixed with any other drug.	
The interaction of drug1 with other cardioactive drugs has not been studied. 	
In addition to bleeding associated with drug1 and drug2 , drugs that alter platelet function (such as drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to or after drug6 therapy.	
The occurrence of stupor, muscular rigidity, severe agitation, and elevated temperature has been reported in some patients receiving the combination of drug1 and drug2 . 	
Symptoms usually resolve over days when the combination is discontinued. 	
This is typical of the interaction of drug1 and drug2 . 	
Other serious reactions (including severe agitation, hallucinations, and death) have been reported in patients receiving this combination. 	
Severe toxicity has also been reported in patients receiving the combination of drug1 and drug2 and drug3 and drug4 . 	
One case of hypertensive crisis has been reported in a patient taking the recommended doses of drug1 and a drug2 ( drug3 ).	
When drug1 and drug2 are used together, the signs of atropinization (flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, dryness of the mouth and nose) may occur earlier than might be expected when drug3 is used alone. 	
This is especially true if the total dose of drug1 has been large and the administration of drug2 has been delayed. 	
2 - 4 The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning, although they do not bear directly on the use of drug1 : since drug2 are potentiated by the drug3 , they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions; 	
drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 should be avoided in patients with organophosphate poisoning.	
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with drug1 . 	
drug1 administered concomitantly with drug2 may significantly decrease the serum concentrations of drug3 . 	
Laboratory Tests The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. 	
The physician should be informed that certain endocrine and liver function tests, and blood components may be affected by progestin therapy: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). 	
(b) Plasma and urinary gonadotropin levels are decreased (e.g., LH, FSH). 	
(c) SHBG concentrations are decreased. 	
(d) T3-uptake values may decrease. 	
(e) There may be small changes in coagulation factors. 	
(f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased slightly. 	
(g) There may be small changes in lipid profiles.	
In clinical studies of drug1 , patients taking drug2 concomitantly with drug3 ( drug4 , Genentech), drug5 , inhaled drug6 , other drug7 , or parenteral drug8 demonstrated adverse experience profiles similar to the study population as a whole. 	
Concurrent and/or sequential use of drug1 with other drugs with neurotoxic or ototoxic potential should be avoided. 	
Some drug1 can enhance drug2 toxicity by altering drug3 concentrations in serum and tissue. 	
drug1 should not be administered concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 .	
DRUG INTERACTIONS  There are no known drug/drug interactions with oral drug1 Vaccinations with drug2 are not recommended in immunocompromised individuals drug3 together with high-dose intravenous drug4 has caused deaths in children due to haemorrhagic enterocolitis.  	
Impaired renal function has been described in bone marrow transplant patients who were conditioned with high-dose intravenous drug1 and who subsequently received drug2 to prevent graft-versus-host disease	
drug1 should be administered with caution to patients taking drug2 because of the possibility of conduction disturbances. 	
Drugs with parasympathomimetic effects administered concurrently with drug1 would be expected to result in additive pharmacologic effects. 	
 drug1 might antagonize the anticholinergic effects of drugs used concomitantly. 	
These effects should be considered when anticholinergic properties may be contributing to the therapeutic effect of concomitant medication (e.g., drug1 , inhaled drug2 ). 	
While no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, the following concomitant drugs were used in at least 10% of patients in either or both Sj   grens efficacy studies: drug1 , artificial tears, drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , and drug13 .	
The induction dose requirements of drug1 Injectable Emulsion may be reduced in patients with intramuscular or intravenous premedication, particularly with drug2 (eg, drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 , etc.) 	
and combinations of drug1 and drug2 (eg, drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , etc.). 	
These agents may increase the anesthetic or sedative effects of drug1 Injectable Emulsion and may also result in more pronounced decreases in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures and cardiac output. 	
During maintenance of anesthesia or sedation, the rate of drug1 Injectable Emulsion administration should be adjusted according to the desired level of anesthesia or sedation and may be reduced in the presence of supplemental drug2 (eg, drug3 or drug4 ). 	
The concurrent administration of potent inhalational agents (eg, drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 ) during maintenance with drug4 Injectable Emulsion has not been extensively evaluated. 	
These inhalational agents can also be expected to increase the anesthetic or sedative and cardiorespiratory effects of drug1 Injectable Emulsion. 	
drug1 Injectable Emulsion does not cause a clinically significant change in onset, intensity, or duration of action of the commonly used drug2 (eg, drug3 and drug4 ). 	
No significant adverse interactions with commonly used premedications or drugs used during anesthesia or sedation (including a range of drug1 , inhalational agents, drug2 , and local drug3 ) have been observed.	
Oral drug1 has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of drug2 and drug3 , resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. 	
Drug interactions should be kept in mind when drug1 ( drug2 gel), 1% is prescribed for patients who are receiving anticoagulant treatment, although they are less likely to occur with topical drug3 administration because of low absorption.    	
 drug1 should be used with caution in patients on steroid therapy because of the potential for developing hypokalemia. 	
Caution is advised for patients receiving high-dose drug1 and drug2 concomitantly, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, coma and death have been reported with concomitant use of high-dose drug3 and drug4 .	
drug1 may be used with drug2 , drug3 and other drug4 , and with other drug5 . 	
If signs of folate deficiency develop, drug1 should be discontinued. 	
drug1 ( drug2 ) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored. 	
Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when drug1 and drug2 were administered concomitantly.	
Due to its effects on gastric emptying, drug1 therapy should not be considered for patients taking drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility (e.g., drug2 such as drug3 ) and agents that slow the intestinal absorption of nutrients (e.g., drug4 ). 	
Patients using these drugs have not been studied in clinical trials. 	
 drug1 has the potential to delay the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. 	
When the rapid onset of a concomitant orally administered agent is a critical determinant of effectiveness (such as drug1 ), the agent should be administered at least 1 hour prior to or 2 hours after drug2 injection. 	
In clinical trials, the concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 did not alter the adverse event profile of drug3 . 	
No formal interaction studies have been performed to assess the effect of drug1 on the kinetics of oral drug2 . 	
Mixing drug1 and drug2 The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug3 were altered when mixed with regular, NPH, and 70/30 premixed formulations of recombinant drug4 immediately prior to injection. 	
Thus, drug1 and drug2 should not be mixed and must be administered separately.	
Since drug1 is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter drug2 plasma concentrations. 	
In a formal, single-dose interaction study (n = 6 males) the clearance of drug1 was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of drug2 , an inhibitor of CYP1A2. 	
In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of drug1 did not alter the kinetics of drug2 in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group. 	
However, the metabolic clearance of drug1 in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70% making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable. 	
In this crossover steady state study, the pharmacokinetics of drug1 were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of drug2 . 	
Addition of drug1 to drug2 did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS, QTc, RR, and PR intervals than drug3 alone. 	
When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs with drug1 is initiated, the dose of drug2 should be slowly titrated to desired effect. 	
In a large compassionate use program drug1 has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal, drug2 , and drug3 without observed interactions. 	
A variety of drug1 such as drug2 or drug3 were also added, sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy. 	
When drug1 or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as drug2 and drug3 have been taken concurrently with drug4 , lowered drug5 plasma levels have been reported. 	
Monitoring of drug1 plasma levels is recommended during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy. 	
In a formal study, drug1 were shown not to affect drug2 plasma concentrations. 	
ECG intervals (PR, QRS, and QT) were not affected by concurrent drug1 and drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 	
Concurrent administration of drug1 and drug2 has been reported to increase, decrease, or leave unchanged drug3 plasma levels; 	
therefore patients should be followed carefully during concurrent therapy. 	
drug1 does not alter serum drug2 levels but drug3 , when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to drug4 , has been reported to lower serum drug5 levels. 	
Concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 may lead to increased plasma drug3 levels. 	
One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72% mean increase (range 35-136%) in plasma drug1 levels. 	
This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting drug1 . drug2 plasma levels returned to pre- drug3 values within 48 hours after discontinuing drug4 . If drug5 and drug6 are to be used concurrently, drug7 blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the drug8 dose is changed. 	
An appropriate adjustment in drug1 dose should be considered. 	
Additionally, in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients, the clearance of drug1 was decreased 50% following the administration of drug2 .	
drug1 (oral): The activity of oral drug2 may be potentiated by anti-vitamin-K activity attributed to drug3 .    	
- drug1 : Hyperthyroidism may cause an increased clearance of beta ratio. 	
A dose reduction of drug1 may be needed when a hyperthyroid patient becomes euthyroid. 	
drug1 : Serum digitalis levels may be increased when hyperthyroid patients on a stable drug2 regimen become euthyroid; 	
reduced dosage of drug1 may be required. 	
drug1 : drug2 clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable drug3 regimen become euthyroid; 	
a reduced dose of drug1 may be needed.    	
Other drug1 should not be used concomitantly with drug2 because they may have additive effects.	
Some drug1 may interact with drug2 . 	
They can either increase or decrease the effect of drug1 . 	
Those drug1 include drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 	
drug1 may also affect the effects of other drugs, which include some drug2 , drug3 , certain heart medicines, birth control pills, drug4 , drug5 and drug6 Please note that drug7 may interact with other drugs that are not listed here.	
Use with Other drug1 : The depressant effects of drug2 are potentiated by the presence of other drug3 such as drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or drug7 . 	
Use of drug1 in conjunction with oral drug2 may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension and profound sedation or coma. 	
Interaction with drug1 : drug2 (i.e., drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 ) should NOT be administered to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a proof drug7 . 	
In these patients, the mixed agonist/antagonist may alter the analgesic effect or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.	
drug1 may decrease the hypotensive effect of drug2 . 	
Use cautiously with pressor agents. 	
Human pharmacologic studies have shown that drug1 may inhibit the metabolism of drug2 , drug3 ( drug4 , drug5 , drug6 ), drug7 , and drug8 ( drug9 , drug10 , drug11 ). 	
Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with drug1 . 	
Serious adverse events have been reported in concomitant use with drug1 , although no causality for the combination has been established. 	
The safety of using drug1 in combination with drug2 or other centrally acting drug3 has not been systemically evaluated.    	
Co-administration of drug1 with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ) may increases drug13 concentrations. 	
Grapefruit may also increase plasma concentrations of drug1 . 	
Co-administration of drug1 with inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , St. Johns Wort) may decrease drug9 concentrations. 	
St. 	
Johns Wort may decrease drug1 plasma concentrations unpredictably. 	
Patients receiving drug1 should not take St. 	
Johns Wort concomitantly. 	
 drug1 dose modification is recommended in patients using concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.	
drug1 : Excessive reductions in blood pressure may occur in patients on diuretic therapy when drug2 are started. 	
The possibility of hypotensive effects with drug1 can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with drug2 . If this is not possible, the starting dose of drug3 should be reduced.. 	
drug1 Supplements and drug2 : drug3 can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. 	
Use of drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) or drug5 supplements concomitantly with drug6 can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. 	
Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored. 	
Oral drug1 : Interaction studies with drug2 failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the drug3 or on its anticoagulant effect. 	
drug1 : Increased serum drug2 levels and symptoms of drug3 toxicity have been reported in patients receiving drug4 during therapy with drug5 . 	
These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 levels is recommended. 	
If a drug1 is also used, the risk of drug2 toxicity may be increased. 	
Other Agents: No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when drug1 was administered concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 	
drug1 has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , oral drug6 , and cholesterol-lowering agents. 	
There was no evidence of clinically important adverse interactions.	
 drug1 is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. 	
Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs could result in delayed clearance of drug1 . 	
Concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g., drug1 ) could potentially result in delayed clearance of drug2 . 	
Although drug1 (400 mg qid) can be administered with drug2 in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance    80 mL/min), caution should be used when administering drug3 concurrently with drug4 to patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min). 	
Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should avoid taking drug1 with short elimination half-lives for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of drug2 . 	
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between drug1 and drug2 with longer half-lives, all patients taking these drug3 should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following drug4 administration. 	
If concomitant administration of an drug1 is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity. 	
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None known.	
Prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored if drug1 is administered with drug2 .   	
Concurrent use of drug1 with oral drug2 may render oral drug3 less effective.  	
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  There are no reported drug-laboratory test interactions.	
drug1 may interact with the following drugs: drug2 and other drug3 (may lower drug4 levels), drug5 (bioavailability of oral drug6 is increased with coadministration), drug7 (may decrease drug8 levels), drug9 (reports of psychotic episodes when coadministered), drug10 (coadministration of drug11 with drug12 can inhibit ovarian function in women), drug13 and other sedating drugs (may result in additive sedation and an increased incidence of adverse effects), and drug14 (coadministration of drug15 and drug16 may interfere with the efficacy of the drug17 ).	
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that drug1 does not inhibit the metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 	
In vitro studies have also shown that drug1 inhibits CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. 	
This may be of clinical relevance for compounds predominantly metabolized by this enzyme, such as drug1 ,    -blockers, drug2 ( drug3 ), and drug4 , if they have a narrow therapeutic window. 	
In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in normal volunteer subjects showed that drug1 does not affect the clearance of drug2 or drug3 . 	
drug1 decreases the clearance of drug2 by 19%. 	
drug1 increases the clearance of drug2 by 15%. 	
There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral drug1 and drug2 , however, a causal relationship between drug3 Tablets and these changes has not been established. 	
drug1 clearance is increased 100% by drug2 , a CyP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by drug3 , a CyP450 enzyme inhibitor. 	
drug1 clearance is unaffected by drug2 . 	
There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral drug1 , hormone replacement therapies, drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 .	
 drug1 may demonstrate additive toxicity when used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. 	
drug1 has been reported to prolong the elimination half-life of drug2 and may lead to severe bone marrow suppression; 	
a reduction of the drug1 dosage should be considered in patients receiving drug2 concurrently. 	
The concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 has been reported in one case to result in reduced drug3 cytotoxicity.    	
drug1 : drug2 causes a 60% reduction in the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of drug3 and should not be coadministered with drug4 . 	
drug1 : The coadministration of drug2 and drug3 has not been assessed under chronic conditions. 	
However, 10% decreases in prothrombin time have been observed in single-dose studies. 	
If drug1 is given concurrently with drug2 , prothrombin time should be monitored. 	
Other Highly Protein-Bound Drugs: drug1 is more than 95% bound to plasma proteins. 	
In vitro, drug1 did not affect the binding of drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 	
Caution should be used when drug1 is coadministered with other highly protein-bound drugs, such as drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 	
See also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions	
drug1 may increase the effects of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 	
It may also interact with drug1 (increased thrombocytopenia), drug2 (increased nephrotoxicity), drug3 (increased hypoglycemic response), drug4 (increased anticoagulant effect), drug5 (decreased renal excretion of drug6 ), drug7 (decreased hepatic clearance of drug8 ).	
drug1 , such as the drug2 ( drug3 , drug4 , drug5 ) or drug6 , ordinarily should not be administered concurrently with drug7 (a drug8 ); 	
these agents may diminish the effectiveness of drug1 . 	
Because drug1 is approximately 90% bound to plasma proteins, caution should be exercised if drug2 is coadministered with other drugs known to affect protein binding.	
Drug Interactions: Women on oral drug1 have shown a significant increase in plasma drug2 levels.	
The effects of drug1 on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by drug2 and drug3 . 	
Additive sedative effects can occur when drug1 is given with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 . 	
The finding that drug1 releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving drug2 . 	
Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., drug1 ) by drug2 , whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 ). 	
Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. 	
Exogenously administered drug1 may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. 	
Because the action of drug1 will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, drug2 dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment.	
The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important. 	
Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as drug1 , drug2 and drug3 may increase the clearance of drug4 and may require increases in drug5 dose to achieve the desired response. 	
Drugs such as drug1 and drug2 may inhibit the metabolism of drug3 and thus decrease their clearance. 	
Therefore, the dose of drug1 should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. 	
drug1 may increase the clearance of chronic high dose drug2 . 	
This could lead to decreased drug1 serum levels or increase the risk of drug2 toxicity when drug3 is withdrawn. 	
drug1 should be used cautiously in conjunction with drug2 in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. 	
The effect of drug1 on oral drug2 is variable. 	
There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of drug1 when given concurrently with drug2 . 	
Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.	
Co-administration of oral drug1 200 mg twice daily increased drug2 geometric mean AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 81% after topical application of drug3 ointment, 1% on the abraded skin of healthy adult males. 	
Due to low systemic exposure to drug1 following topical application in patients, dosage adjustments for drug2 are unnecessary when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as drug3 . 	
Based on in vitro P450 inhibition studies and the low systemic exposure observed following topical application of drug1 , drug2 is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other P450 substrates. 	
The effect of concurrent application of drug1 and other topical products to the same area of skin has not been studied.	
drug1 may interact with drug2 ( drug3 type), drug4 (e.g., drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 ), drug11 , drug12 , drug13 (e.g., drug14 ), other drug15 , drug16 supplements, drug17 , drug18 (e.g., drug19 - drug20 ), drug21 (e.g., drug22 , drug23 ).	
 drug1 is highly protein bound, and therefore, might be expected to displace other protein-bound drugs. 	
Although this has not occurred in in vitro studies with drug1 , interactions with drug2 have been reported with drug3 since marketing, therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering drug4 to patients on drug5 and other highly protein-bound drugs. 	
Plasma levels of drug1 are depressed to approximately 80% of their normal values when drug2 is administered in conjunction with drug3 (3900 mg/day), but concomitant administration of drug4 has no effect on drug5 plasma levels . drug6 , including drug7 , have been reported to increase steady state plasma drug8 levels. 	
It is recommended that plasma drug1 levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing drug2 .	
When administered concurrently, drug1 may increase the effects of oral drug2 ; 	
monitor and adjust drug1 dosage accordingly. 	
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Physiologic effects of drug1 may result in decreased estradiol concentrations with radioimmunoassays for estradiol, increased plasma calcium concentrations, and increased 24-hour urinary excretion of creatine and 17-ketosteroids.	
Although a causal relationship has not been established, there have been reports of bleeding and/or prolonged prothrombin time in patients treated with drug1 with and without drug2 or drug3 . 	
Patients on drug1 should have more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times, while patients with other risk factors complicated by hemorrhage (e.g., recent surgery, peptic ulceration) should have periodic examinations for bleeding including hematocrit and/or hemoglobin. 	
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 -containing drugs leads to increased drug3 levels and drug4 toxicity in some individuals. 	
Such patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity and have their drug1 dosage adjusted as necessary. 	
drug1 has been used concurrently with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 , without observed problems. 	
Small decreases in blood pressure have been observed in some patients treated with drug1 ; 	
periodic systemic blood pressure monitoring is recommended for patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive therapy. 	
If indicated, dosage of the drug1 should be reduced.	
Drug Interactions: The use of drug1 ( drug2 ) Injection before drug3 , for the purpose of attenuating some of the side effects of drug4 , has not been studied. 	
If drug1 is administered following administration of drug2 , it should not be given until recovery from drug3 has been observed. 	
The median duration of action of drug1 0.6 mg/kg administered after a 1 mg/kg dose of drug2 when T 1 returned to 75% of control was 36 minutes (range 14-57, n=12) vs. 	
28 minutes (17-51, n=12) without drug1 . 	
There are no controlled studies documenting the use of drug1 before or after other drug2 . 	
Interactions have been observed when other drug1 have been administered in succession. 	
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:       None known.	
Concurrent administration of drug1 (e.g., drug2 , drug3 ) may diminish the bactericidal effects of drug4 by slowing the rate of bacterial growth. 	
Bactericidal agents work most effectively against the immature cell wall of rapidly proliferating microorganisms. 	
This has been demonstrated in vitro; 	
however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. 	
There are few clinical situations in which the concurrent use of ''static'' and ''cidal '' drug1 are indicated. 	
However, in selected circumstances in which such therapy is appropriate, using adequate doses of drug1 agents and beginning penicillin therapy first, should minimize the potential for interaction. 	
drug1 blood levels may be prolonged by concurrent administration of drug2 which blocks the renal tubular secretion of drug3 . 	
Displacement of drug1 from plasma protein binding sites will elevate the level of free drug2 in the serum.	
Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., drug1 ) may have an additive effect when given with drug2 . 	
Patients receiving drug1 plus a catecholamine-depleting agent should, therefore, be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 	
drug1 has been used with a variety of drug2 , including drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 without unexpected adverse interactions. 	
drug1 has been shown to increase serum drug2 levels when both drugs are co-administered. 	
 drug1 levels may also be increased with this combination. 	
Risk of anaphylactic reaction: While taking drug1 , patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. 	
Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of drug1 used to treat allergic reactions.	
Although specific drug or food interactions with drug1 have not been studied, on the basis of this drug   s metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of drug5 ). 	
Furthermore, drug1 , drug2 , St. 	
John   s Wort, and certain drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) may induce drug5 metabolism (lowering serum levels of drug6 ). 	
Based on in vitro inhibition information, coadministration of drug1 may lead to an increase in serum levels of drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates. 	
Due to the slow elimination of drug1 from the body, such interaction may be observed for a prolonged period after its administration. 	
Therefore, caution should be exercised when drug1 is administered with drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates and have narrow therapeutic range, including some agents used during general anesthesia.	
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 has been associated with erythema and histamine-like flushing and anaphylactoid reactions. 	
Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , or drug7 , when indicated, requires careful monitoring.	
Potential for drug1 to Affect Other Drugs drug2 is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes. 	
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that drug1 does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. 	
Therefore, drug1 is not expected to inhibit clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner. 	
 drug1 is also not expected to have enzyme inducing properties. 	
At therapeutic concentrations, drug1 did not inhibit P-glycoprotein. 	
 drug1 is therefore not expected to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of other drugs in a clinically relevant manner. 	
Given the primary CNS effects of drug1 , drug2 should be used with caution in combination with other drug3 and drug4 . 	
drug1 may antagonize the effect of drug2 and other drug3 . 	
Because of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension, an additive effect may be observed when drug1 is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential. 	
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect drug1 drug2 is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, so that an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely. 	
While in vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in drug1 metabolism, in vivo studies do not show decreased elimination by these isozymes and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance.	
The interaction of drug1 ( drug2 ) with other drugs has not been studied in humans. 	
Patients who are receiving drug1 concurrently with other drugs, especially drugs with CNS activity, should be monitored carefully. 	
Decreased seizure threshold has been reported in patients receiving drug1 concomitantly with drug2 .	
CYP 3A4 Inhibitors (e.g. drug1 and drug2 ) There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of certain drug3 (e.g. drug4 and drug5 ) and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, resulting in vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. 	
Although there have been no reports of such interactions with drug1 alone, potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should not be coadministered with methylergonovine. 	
Examples of some of the more potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors include drug1 (e.g., drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ), drug5 or drug6 (e.g., drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 ) or drug11 (e.g., drug12 , drug13 , drug14 ). 	
Less potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should be administered with caution. 	
Less potent inhibitors include drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , grapefruit juice, drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 . 	
These lists are not exhaustive, and the prescriber should consider the effects on CYP 3A4 of other agents being considered for concomitant use with drug1 . 	
No pharmacokinetic interactions involving other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are known. 	
Caution should be exercised when drug1 ( drug2 ) is used concurrently with other drug3 or drug4 .	
To minimize CNS depression and possible potentiation, drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 or drug5 should be used with caution. 	
 drug1 should not be used since there may be an Antabuse (disulfiram)-like reaction. 	
Because drug1 exhibits some monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity, drug2 , drug3 drugs (e.g., drug4 , drug5 ) and other drugs and foods with known high drug6 content, such as wine, yogurt, ripe cheese and bananas, should be avoided. 	
A further phenomenon of toxicity common to many drug1 is hemolysis and the appearance of Heinz-Ehrlich inclusion bodies in erythrocytes.  	
No cross-resistance with other drug1 , radiotherapy or drug2 has been demonstrated.	
drug1 are capable of potentiating drug2 (e.g., drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , etc.) 	
as well as drug1 and drug2 .	
Drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function, including all corticosteroid therapy, must be discontinued prior to and during testing with drug1 . 	
The metabolism of drug1 is accelerated by drug2 ; 	
therefore, results of the test may be inaccurate in patients taking drug1 within two weeks before. 	
Asubnormal response may occur in patients on estrogen therapy. 	
drug1 inhibits the glucuronidation of drug2 and could possibly potentiate drug3 toxicity.	
Preliminary evidence suggests that drug1 inhibits drug2 metabolism and may result in an increase in plasma concentrations of drug3 .	
 drug1 is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, primarily the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes, and subsequently undergoes Phase II conjugation. 	
Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of drug1 with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 (and its active metabolite, drug8 ), drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , an oral drug15 ( drug16 / drug17 ), drug18 , drug19 , drug20 , drug21 , drug22 , drug23 , drug24 , or drug25 . 	
Clinically relevant interactions of drug1 with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. 	
Therefore, when coadministered with drug1 , adjustment of the dosage of drug2 or of such drugs may not be necessary. 	
There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered drug1 . 	
There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving drug1 , including drug2 , and drug3 concomitantly. 	
Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. 	
Patients treated with drug1 and drug2 concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. 	
Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, drug1 may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, drug2 , drug3 esters, and drug4 salts). 	
Laboratory Tests There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for drug1 ( drug2 ) in patients receiving most drug3 , including drug4 . 	
An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.	
drug1 may increase the effects of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 . 	
It may also interact with drug1 (increased thrombocytopenia), drug2 (increased nephrotoxicity), drug3 (increased hypoglycemic response), drug4 (increased anticoagulant effect), drug5 (decreased renal excretion of drug6 ), drug7 (decreased hepatic clearance of drug8 ).	
drug1 may compete with other drugs, such as drug2 , for sites of metabolism in the liver, thus elevating the serum levels of such compounds to potentially toxic levels. 	
Therefore, when concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 is anticipated, it may be necessary to monitor blood levels and/or reduce the dosage of such compounds. 	
Such concomitant use should be administered under careful medical supervision.	
Administration of drug1 decreases oral clearance of drug2 by about 5%. 	
The clinical implication of this effect is not known. 	
Patients with Severe Hepatic or Renal Impairment Caution should be exercised when drug1 Capsules are administered to patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.	
Pharmacokinetic studies show that there are no significant alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters of drug1 or drug2 to warrant dosage adjustment when drug3 is administered with these drugs. 	
A pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that coadministration of drug1 and drug2 results in a significant decrease in the pharmacokinetic parameters (~36% for Cmax and ~28% for AUC) of drug3 . 	
Administration of a higher dose of drug1 should be considered when coadministering with drug2 . 	
The effects of drug1 , drug2 or drug3 on the pharmacokinetics of drug4 were not studied.	
drug1 , particularly drug2 , may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias during drug3 anesthesia and therefore should be used only with great caution or not at all. 	
drug1 - The pressor effect of drug2 is markedly potentiated in patients receiving drug3 ( drug4 ). 	
Therefore, when initiating pressor therapy in these patients, the initial dose should be small and used with due caution. 	
The pressor response of drug1 may also be potentiated by drug2 .	
The CNS-depressant effect of drug1 is additive with that of other drug2 , including drug3 . 	
As is the case with many medicinal agents, drug1 may slow the metabolism of a concomitantly administered drug. 	
Should this occur, the higher serum concentrations of that drug may result in increased pharmacologic or adverse effects of that drug. 	
Such occurrences have been reported when drug1 was administered to patients on drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 -like drugs. 	
Sever neurologic signs, including coma, have occurred with concurrent use of drug1 .	
Reduced absorption of drug1 and drug2 have been reported when those agents were administered concomitantly with drug3 . 	
When daily doses of drug1 2 g and weekly doses of drug2 7.5 mg were coadministered to 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients in a drug-drug interaction study, the pharmacokinetic disposition of the drugs was not altered. 	
Daily doses of drug1 2 g (maximum 3 g) and weekly doses of drug2 7.5 mg (maximum 15 mg) were administered alone or in combination to 310 rheumatoid arthritis patients in two controlled 52-week clinical studies. 	
The overall toxicity profile of the combination revealed an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events, especially nausea, when compared to the incidence associated with either drug administered alone. 	
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: The presence of drug1 or its metabolites in body fluids has not been reported to interfere with laboratory test procedures.

drug1 : There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of drug2 with the co-administration of 100 mg drug3 for 10 days. 	
Patients receiving drug1 should be monitored appropriately. 	
No dosage adjustment of drug1 or drug2 is recommended.	
While co-administration of drug1 appeared to increase the clearance of drug2 by 70%, these results are not conclusive because of the small number of subjects studied and because patients took variable doses of drug3 . 	
Combination therapy with drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 is not indicated.	
drug1 may reverse the analgesic activity of drug2 . 	
Concurrent use with drug1 including drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 (e.g. smoking) may result in enhanced vasoconstriction.	
Interactions for drug1 ( drug2 ): drug3 , Oral drug4 , drug5 , drug6 	
Interactions for drug1 ( drug2 ): drug3 - impairs the intestinal absorption of drug4 	
drug1 - concurrent use decreases gastrointestinal absorption of drug2 ; 	
requirements for drug1 may be increased in patients receiving drug2 .	
drug1 can interact with drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 .	
drug1 : Absorption of a single dose of drug2 was decreased when administered to 12 stable renal transplant patients also taking drug3 - drug4 containing drug5 (30 mL): the mean Cmax and AUC(0-t) values for MPA were 25% and 37% lower, respectively, than when drug6 was administered alone under fasting conditions. 	
It is recommended that drug1 and drug2 not be administered simultaneously. 	
drug1 : When studied in stable renal transplant patients, drug2 , USP (MODIFIED) pharmacokinetics were unaffected by steady state dosing of drug3 . 	
drug1 / drug2 : may be taken with drug3 ; 	
however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts. 	
Both drug1 / drug2 and drug3 concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, their coexistence may compete for tubular secretion and further increase in the concentrations of the two. 	
drug1 / drug2 : Given that drug3 and drug4 inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that drug5 not be administered concomitantly with drug6 or drug7 . 	
drug1 and Drugs that Bind Bile Acids: These drugs interrupt enterohepatic recirculation and reduce drug2 exposure when coadministered with drug3 . 	
Therefore, do not administer drug1 with drug2 or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, for example bile acid sequestrates or oral drug3 , because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of drug4 . 	
Oral drug1 : Given the different metabolism of drug2 and oral drug3 , no drug interaction between these two classes of drug is expected. 	
However, in a drug-drug interaction study, mean drug1 AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with drug2 . 	
Therefore, it is recommended that oral drug1 are co- administered with drug2 with caution and additional birth control methods be considered. 	
drug1 : During treatment with drug2 , the use of drug3 should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. 	
Influenza vaccination may be of value. 	
Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 	
Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with drug1 by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. 	
Interference of drug1 hydrolysis may lead to less drug2 available for absorption.	
 drug1 has been used concomitantly with other drugs commonly used in COPD without increases in adverse drug reactions. 	
These include drug1 , drug2 , and oral and inhaled drug3 . 	
However, the co   administration of drug1 with other drug2 containing drugs (e.g., drug3 ) has not been studied and is therefore not recommended.	
Interaction with Other drug1 : drug2 SHOULD BE USED WITH GREAT CAUTION AND IN REDUCED DOSAGE IN PATIENTS WHO ARE CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING OTHER drug3 , GENERAL drug4 , drug5 , OTHER drug6 , drug7 (INCLUDING drug8 ), drug9 AND OTHER drug10 (INCLUDING drug11 ). 	
RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, HYPOTENSION, AND PROFOUND SEDATION OR COMA MAY RESULT.	
Drug-Drug Interactions: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug1 capsules and other drug2 have not been determined. 	
However, interactions may be expected and drug1 capsules should NOT be used in combination with other drug2 . 	
The pharmacokinetic interaction between drug1 and drug2 capsules was investigated. 	
The results indicate significant changes in drug1 clearance (26% decrease) and AUC (44% increase). 	
Therefore, drug1 capsules should be used with caution in combination with drug2 , particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg. 	
Results from limited in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction studies between drug1 and drug2 are inconclusive. 	
Therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 capsules.        	
Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., drug1 ) may have an additive effect when given with drug2 . 	
Patients treated with extended release drug1 plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.	
Concomitant administration contra-indicated:  - Vasoconstrictive drug1 .  	
Concomitant administrations not recommended:  - drug1 and drug2 : Certain drug3 interact with drug4 and drug5 leading to increased serum concentrations of the latter. 	
This may result in severe ventricular arrhythmia, typically torsades de pointe. 	
Although such a reaction has not been demonstrated with drug1 , concomitant administration of drug2 with drug3 or drug4 is not recommended. 	
- drug1 , drug2 : Other drugs such as drug3 or drug4 , which are metabolised by hepatic CYP3A isozymes have been associated with QT interval prolongation and/or cardiac arrythmias (typically torsades de pointe) as a result of increase in their serum level subsequent to interaction with significant inhibitors of the isozyme, including some drug5 . 	
Although such a risk is not verified for drug1 , combination of drug2 with such drugs is not recommended.	
drug1 : The effects of chronic drug2 use on the metabolism of drug3 are not known. 	
When a single 100 mg dose of drug1 was administered one hour after the initiation of drug2 (300 mg four times a day), the apparent total drug3 clearance of this single dose in normal healthy adults was reduced by 18% (compared to the apparent total drug4 clearance in the same subjects in the absence of drug5 ). 	
drug1 : drug2 , 100 mg, was given twice daily for 13 days to 12 healthy volunteers. 	
On day 11, drug1 (650 mg four times daily) was started and continued for 8 days. 	
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 were assessed on days 11 and 13. 	
Coadministration with drug1 reduced the peak concentration and AUC values for drug2 by approximately 11%. 	
drug1 : drug2 , 100 mg, was given twice daily fro 13 days to 12 healthy volunteers. 	
On day 11, drug1 (650 mg, four times daily) was started and continued for 8 days. 	
The pharmacokinetics of drug1 were assessed on days 11 and 13. 	
Peak plasma concentrations and AUC of drug1 were reduced approximately 10% in the presence of drug2 .	
Because drug1 have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on drug2 therapy may require downward adjustment of their drug3 dosage. 	
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of drug1 , it is advisable to avoid giving drug2 in conjunction with drug3 . 	
Absorption of drug1 is impaired by drug2 containing drug3 , drug4 or drug5 , and drug6 -containing preparations. 	
The concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 	
Concurrent use of drug1 with oral drug2 may render oral drug3 less effective.	
There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with drug1 in humans. 	
Administration of drug1 in combination with drug2 resulted in a two-fold decrease in drug3 clearance in a non-human primate study and in a 1.5-fold increase in drug4 serum levels in clinical studies.	
The concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. 	
 drug1 may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 	
Drugs Eliminated by Active Tubular Secretion: Although studies to assess drug-drug interactions with drug1 have not been conducted, drug2 has the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g. drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and drug9 ). 	
Coadministration of drug1 with drugs that are eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may increase the serum concentration of drug2 and/or the coadministered drug due to competition for this elimination pathway. 	
Careful patient monitoring is recommended in patients receiving such drugs. 	
Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between drug1 and laboratory tests have not been studied.	
Caution should be observed in administering drug1 to patients receiving drug2 or drug3 because the extrapyramidal effects of these drugs can be expected to be potentiated by inhibition of catecholamine synthesis. 	
Concurrent use of drug1 with drug2 or other drug3 can increase their sedative effects.	
You cannot take drug1 if you have taken a drug2 ( drug3 ) such as drug4 ( drug5 ), drug6 ( drug7 ), or drug8 ( drug9 ) in the last 14 days. 	
Changes in drug1 and other diabetes drug therapies may be necessary during treatment with drug2 .	
drug1 may reduce the effects of drug2 ( drug3 ). 	
This could lead to an increase in blood pressure. 	
Tell your doctor if you are taking drug1 . 	
Before taking this medication, tell your doctor if you are taking a drug1 such as drug2 ( drug3 ), drug4 ( drug5 ), drug6 ( drug7 ), drug8 ( drug9 ), drug10 ( drug11 ), drug12 ( drug13 ), drug14 ( drug15 ), or drug16 ( drug17 ). 	
These drugs may decrease the effects of drug1 .	
drug1 has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of drug2 by the mechanism of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, leading to an increase in dosage requirements for drug3 . 	
Therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in drug1 dosage requirements when administering drug2 to patients on drug3 . 	
In addition, drug1 should be given with caution to patients receiving other drugs susceptible to the influence of hepatic enzyme induction.	
 drug1 -containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. 	
Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of drug1 -containing or drug2 (like drug3 or drug4 ) and drug5 within 24 hours of each other should be avoided. 	
drug1 reduce drug2 clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. 	
Therefore, the use of drug1 tablets in patients receiving drug2 is contraindicated . drug3 ( drug4 ) (e.g., drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) have been reported, rarely, to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with drug9 . 	
If concomitant treatment with drug1 and an drug2 is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.	
The bioavailability of drug1 is decreased 80% by drug2 , when drug3 and drug4 are administered at the same time, and 60% by some drug5 - or drug6 -containing drug7 , when administered 1 hour before drug8 . 	
drug1 may decrease bioavailability of drug2 by up to 50% when taken 2 hours after drug3 . 	
The bioavailability of drug1 is increased 2-4 fold by drug2 but is not significantly altered by coadministration of drug3 . 	
The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug1 are not significantly modified by drug2 coadministration. 	
In vitro studies show that drug1 does not displace drug2 from its binding site on protein.	
There is usually complete cross-resistance between drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 brand drug4 . 	
As there is in vitro evidence that drug1 (e.g., drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 ) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, they should be administered with caution to patients receiving concurrent drug5 therapy.    	
Other eye drops or medications such as drug1 ( drug2 ) and drug3 ( drug4 , drug5 ) may decrease the effects of drug6 ophthalmic.	
drug1 , particularly drug2 , may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias during drug3 anesthesia and therefore should be used only with great caution or not at all. 	
drug1 : The pressor effect of drug2 is markedly potentiated in patients receiving drug3 ( drug4 ). 	
Therefore, when initiating pressor therapy in these patients, the initial dose should be small and used with due caution. 	
The pressor response of drug1 may also be potentiated by drug2 .	
 drug1 is not expected to inhibit the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. 	
A multiple dose drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that drug1 approximately doubled drug2 AUC0-   . Since drug3 is partially metabolized by CYP3A and drug4 le is known to be a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme, care should be taken while dosing drug5 with drug6 and other strong P450 3A inhibitors including drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , drug13 , drug14 , drug15 or drug16 . 	
Dose adjustment of drug1 Capsules may be required, and iPTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as drug2 . 	
Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of drug1 , such as drug2 , may interfere with the absorption of drug3 Capsules.	
drug1 competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of drug2 . 	
Therefore, use of drug1 in combination with drug2 should be avoided. 	
In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of drug1 is also inhibited at relevant concentrations by drug2 and drug3 . 	
The clinical significance of these in vitro interactions is unknown; 	
therefore, concomitant use of drug1 with either of these drugs should be undertaken with caution.	
No specific cytochrome P450-based drug interaction studies have been conducted. 	
No pharmacokinetic interaction between 85 mg/m2 drug1 and infusional drug2 has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks. 	
Increases of drug1 plasma concentrations by approximately 20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m2 drug2 dosed every 3 weeks. 	
Since platinum containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these products may be decreased by coadministration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds; 	
although, this has not been specifically studied.	
drug1 is not known to interact with other drugs including drug2 supplements; 	
interactions have not been systematically studied. 	
Concomitant administration of drug1 with other chelation therapy, such as drug2 is not recommended. 	
Drug/Laboratory Tests Interaction: drug1 may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests. 	
In vitro studies have shown drug1 to cause false positive results for ketones in urine using nitroprusside reagents such as Ketostix    and falsely decreased measurements of serum uric acid and CPK.	
drug1 may accentuate the orthostatic hypotension that may occur with drug2 . 	
Antihypertensive effects of drug1 and related compounds may be counteracted when drug2 are used concomitantly. 	
Concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.	
A total of 11 clinical drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the potential for interaction between drug1 and drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 . 	
In these studies, no interaction that altered the pharmacokinetics of drug1 was observed. 	
There was no effect of a single dose or multiple doses of drug1 on drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 pharmacokinetics. 	
drug1 AUC was increased by 21% with no effect on Cmax in the presence of steady-state drug2 compared with drug3 alone. 	
drug1 AUC and Cmax were increased by 18% and 42%, respectively, in the presence of steady-state drug2 compared with drug3 alone. 	
Patients receiving drug1 or drug2 in combination with drug3 should be monitored for drug4 or drug5 toxicity and drug6 or drug7 dosage should be reduced if necessary. 	
 drug1 is not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and, therefore, would not be expected to alter P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activity.    	
Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of drug1 (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). 	
Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of drug1 or drug2 . 	
 drug1 requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. 	
drug1 may decrease arterial responsiveness to drug2 . 	
This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. 	
drug1 may increase the responsiveness of drug2 . 	
drug1 renal clearance is reduced by drug2 , increasing the risk of drug3 toxicity. 	
drug1 may add to or potentiate the action of other drug2 . 	
Potentiation occurs with drug1 or drug2 .	
drug1 / drug2 : drug3 / drug4 does not influence the pharmacokinetics of drug5 in healthy volunteers (N= 10). 	
5 hours. 	
drug1 : In healthy volunteers (N= 11), drug2 did not influence the pharmacokinetics of drug3 . 	
drug1 : Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that drug2 is unlikely to alter the oral clearance of drug3 (N= 54). 	
drug1 : drug2 , a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic bases via the cationic transport system, caused a 50% increase in drug3 AUC and a 40% increase in half-life (N= 12). 	
drug1 : drug2 , a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the aruonic transporter, did not noticeably influence drug3 pharmacokinetics (N= 12). 	
Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , and drug7 ) decreases the oral clearance of drug8 by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 , and drug13 ) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of drug14 . 	
CYP interactions: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect drug1 elimination because drug2 is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro. 	
 drug1 does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYPIA2, CYP2C9, CYP2CI9, CYP2EI, and CYP3A4. 	
Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 uM, indicating that drug1 will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the highest recommended clinical dose (1.5 mg tid). 	
drug1 : Since drug2 is a drug3 , it is possible that drug4 , such as the drug5 ( drug6 , drug7 , drug8 ) or drug9 , may diminish the effectiveness of drug10 . 	
Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions There are no known interactions between drug1 and laboratory tests.	
Do not exceed a 5 mg daily dose of drug1 when administered with therapeutic doses of drug2 or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. 	
Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of drug1 on the QT interval in 76 healthy women, the QT prolonging effect appeared less with drug2 10 mg than with 30 mg (three times the maximum recommended dose), and the effect of drug3 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control drug4 at its therapeutic dose. 	
This observation should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe drug1 for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval.	
drug1 at a Dose of 10 mg Once Daily Dosed to Pharmacokinetic Steady State  - did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of drug2 (predominantly a cytochrome P450 1A2 substrate). 	
- did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of drug1 (a substrate of cytochromes P450 2A6 and 2C9) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of drug2 on prothrombin time or the INR (International Normalized Ratio). 	
- did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive drug1 . 	
- did not change the plasma concentration profile of drug1 (a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4) or drug2 , its carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with drug3 60 mg twice daily. 	
drug1 at Doses of    100 mg Daily Dosed to Pharmacokinetic Steady State:  - did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral drug2 containing drug3 1 mg/ethinyl drug4 35 mcg. 	
- did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of drug1 or drug2 following administration of either oral drug3 or intravenous drug4 .  	
drug1 , which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of drug2 approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of drug3 . 	
No dosage adjustment for drug1 is recommended. 	
It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as drug1 or drug2 , are co-administered with drug3 . 	
 drug1 has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. 	
In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of drug1 did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , oral drug5 ( drug6 1 mg/ drug7 35 mcg), drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 . 	
Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, drug1 was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. 	
These medications included drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 . 	
drug1 , which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of drug2 approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of drug3 . 	
No dosage adjustment for drug1 is recommended. 	
It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as drug1 or drug2 , are co-administered with drug3 .	
In a pharmacokinetic study of 18 chronic hepatitis C patients concomitantly receiving drug1 , treatment with drug2 once weekly for 4 weeks was associated with a mean increase of 16% in drug3 AUC; 	
in 2 out of 18 patients, drug1 AUC doubled. 	
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; 	
however, patients should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of increased narcotic effect.	
As with other drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic inhibition or enhancement, etc.) 	
is a possibility. 	
Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of drug1 ( drug2 ) Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metab-olizing enzymes. 	
Drugs that are Metabolized by and/or Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Many drugs are metabolized by and/or inhibit various cytochrome P450 enzymes, e.g., 2D6, 1A2, 3A4, etc. 	
In vitro studies have shown that drug1 is a substrate for several of these enzymes, including 2D6, 1A2, and 3A4. 	
While in vitro studies have shown that drug1 is not a potent inhibitor of any of these enzymes, an indication that drug2 is not likely to have a clinically significant inhibitory effect on the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes, the concomitant use of drug3 with most other drugs metabolized by these enzymes has not been formally studied. 	
Consequently, it is not possible to make any definitive statements about the risks of coadministration of drug1 with such drugs. 	
drug1 : Concomitant administration of drug2 (equivalent to 60 g) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of drug3 (15 mg) in 6 healthy male subjects. 	
However, the impairment of cognitive and motor skills produced by drug1 were shown to be additive with those produced by drug2 . 	
Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid drug1 while taking drug2 . drug3 : Concomitant administration of drug4 (15 mg) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of drug5 (15 mg) in 12 healthy subjects. 	
However, the impairment of motor skills produced by drug1 has been shown to be additive with those caused by drug2 . 	
Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid drug1 and other similar drugs while taking drug2 .	
drug1 : Spontaneous adverse reaction reports of patients taking concomitant drug2 with recommended doses of drug3 demonstrate QT interval prolongation and rare serious cardiac events, e.g. 	
death, cardiac arrest, and ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes. 	
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that drug1 markedly inhibits the metabolism of drug2 , resulting in elevated plasma drug3 levels. 	
Presence of unchanged drug1 is associated with statistically significant prolongation of the QT and QTc intervals.	
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated. 	
drug1 : Torsades de pointes and elevated parent drug2 levels have been reported during concomitant use of drug3 and drug4 in clinical trials of drug5 and from foreign post-marketing sources. 	
One death has also been reported from foreign post- marketing sources. 	
Concomitant administration of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated. 	
Due to the chemical similarity of other drug1 (including drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 ) to drug5 , and drug6 , concomitant use of these products with drug7 is not recommended pending full examination of potential interactions. 	
drug1 : Clinical drug interaction studies indicate that drug2 and drug3 can exert an effect on drug4 metabolism by a mechanism which may be similar to that of drug5 , but to a lesser extent. 	
Although erythromycin measurably decreases the clearance of the drug1 acid metabolite, its influence on terfenadine plasma levels is still under investigation. 	
A few spontaneous accounts of QT interval prolongation with ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes, have been reported in patients receiving drug1 or drug2 . 	
Concomitant administration of drug1 with drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 is contraindicated: Pending full characterization of potential interactions, concomitant administration of drug5 with other drug6 , including drug7 , is not recommended. 	
Studies to evaluate potential interactions of drug1 with drug2 are in progress.	
Acromegalic patients with diabetes mellitus being treated with drug1 and/or oral drug2 agents may require dose reductions of these therapeutic agents after the initiation of therapy with drug3 . 	
In clinical studies, patients on drug1 often needed higher serum drug2 concentrations to achieve appropriate IGF-I suppression compared with patients not receiving drug3 . 	
The mechanism of this interaction is not known.	
drug1 should be used with caution in digitalized patients, since the combination of drug2 and drug3 may cause ectopic arrhythmias. 	
drug1 or drug2 may potentiate the action of drug3 . 	
Therefore, when initiating pressor therapy in patients receiving these drugs, the initial dose should be small and given with caution.	
drug1 , a bacteriostatic drug2 , may antagonize the bactericidal effect of drug3 and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.	
Concomitant use of drug1 with drug2 may result in an adverse drug interaction.	
drug1 has been studied on a background of drug2 and drug3 . 	
The use of drug1 , in combination with drug2 and drug3 , has been associated with an increase in bleeding compared to drug4 and drug5 alone (see	
Drug Interactions: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Caution is advised when drug1 is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system (ie, some drugs in the drug classes of drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ). 	
Drugs such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 were shown to significantly increase the C max and AUC of orally administered drug7 . 	
These drug interactions may result in increased and prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of drug1 . 	
Although not studied, the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors drug1 and drug2 may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of drug3 . 	
Caution is advised when drug1 is used concomitantly with these drugs. 	
Dose adjustments should be considered and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated. 	
Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 , induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral drug4 in adult studies. 	
Although clinical studies have not been performed, drug1 is expected to have the same effect. 	
Caution is advised when administering drug1 to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered. 	
The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the drug1 due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of drug2 . 	
The sedative effect of drug1 is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly drug2 (eg, drug3 , drug4 and drug5 ), drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 and drug10 . 	
Consequently, the dose of drug1 should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response. 	
No significant adverse interactions with common premedications (such as drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and other drug6 ) or local drug7 have been observed.	
The concomitant use of other drug1 including drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , general drug5 , drug6 , other drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , and drug10 may produce additive CNS depressant effects. 	
When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. 	
drug1 or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with drug2 may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. 	
It has been reported that the incidence of bradycardia was increased when drug1 was combined with drug2 for induction of anesthesia. 	
In addition, CNS toxicity has been reported (confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of drug1 with drug2 ; 	
no clear-cut cause and effect relationship was established.	
Dosages of concomitantly administered drug1 should be reduced by approximately half, because drug2 amplifies the therapeutic actions and side-effects of drug3 . 	
Combination with drug1 ( drug2 ) is associated with increased risk of seizures. 	
Additive sedative effects and confusional states may emerge if drug1 is given with drug2 or drug3 . 	
This may be avoided by using the lowest dose possible with the substances in question. 	
Exert particular caution in combining drug1 with other drug2 ( drug3 and drug4 ): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma. 	
Reduce both the dose of drug1 and the dose of the other drug. 	
If possible, avoid such combinations. 	
drug1 and/or stimulantes of the drug2 / drug3 type may counteract the specific actions of drug4 . 	
Concomitant use of these substances should be avoided. 	
Coffee and black tea should be avoided because they decrease the absorption of drug1 considerably. 	
The same is true for drug1 ; 	
these should be given 1 to 2 hours before or after oral administration of drug1 .	
Usage with drug1 : Due to the potential for increased CNS depressants effects, drug2 should be used with caution in patients who are currently receiving drug3 .	
The CNS depressant effects of drug1 may be additive with that of other drug2 ..	
Limited evidence suggests that drug1 may influence the intensity and duration of action of drug2 .	
drug1 : In a multiple-dose study in 30 normal weight subjects, coadministration of drug2 and 40 grams of drug3 (e.g., approximately 3 glasses of wine) did not result in alteration of drug4 pharmacokinetics, drug5 pharmacodynamics (fecal fat excretion), or systemic exposure to drug6 . 	
drug1 : Preliminary data from a drug2 and drug3 drug interaction study indicate a reduction in drug4 plasma levels when drug5 was coadministered with drug6 . 	
drug1 : In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving drug2 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, drug3 did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug4 . 	
drug1 and Analogues: A pharmacokinetic interaction study showed a 30% reduction in drug2 supplement absorption when concomitantly administered with drug3 . 	
drug1 inhibited absorption of a drug2 supplement by approximately 60%. 	
The effect of drug1 on the absorption of supplemental drug2 , drug3 , and nutritionally-derived drug4 is not known at this time. 	
drug1 : In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving drug2 80 mg three times a day for 5 days, drug3 did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (blood glucose-lowering) of drug4 . 	
drug1 (extended-release tablets): In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving drug2 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, drug3 did not alter the bioavailability of drug4 (extended-release tablets). 	
Oral drug1 : In 20 normal-weight female subjects, the treatment of drug2 120 mg three times a day for 23 days resulted in no changes in the ovulation-suppressing action of oral drug3 . 	
drug1 : In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving drug2 120 mg three times a day for 7 days, drug3 did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 300-mg dose of drug4 . 	
drug1 : In a 2-way crossover study of 24 normal-weight, mildly hypercholesterolemic patients receiving drug2 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, drug3 did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug4 . 	
drug1 : In 12 normal-weight subjects, administration of drug2 120 mg three times a day for 16 days did not result in any change in either drug3 pharmacokinetics (both R- and S-enantiomers) or pharmacodynamics (prothrombin time and serum Factor VII). 	
Although undercarboxylated osteocalcin, a marker of vitamin K nutritional status, was unaltered with drug1 administration, vitamin K levels tended to decline in subjects taking drug2 . 	
Therefore, as drug1 absorption may be decreased with drug2 , patients on chronic stable doses of drug3 who are prescribed drug4 should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters.	
drug1 competes with drug2 for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of drug3 . 	
This led to statistically significant increases in the elimination half-life (38%) and in the extent of systemic exposure (56%). 	
Therefore, the coadministration of drug1 with drug2 is not recommended. 	
There is evidence that drug1 may reduce serum levels of drug2 to subtherapeutic levels (therapeutic range considered to be 50 to 100    g/mL total drug3 ).	
 drug1 does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. 	
Because drug1 is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of drug2 . 	
On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs.  	
drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 : In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 ), the clearance of drug7 was significantly increased and drug8 blood concentrations were decreased. 	
However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for drug1 is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3 drug2 : Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between drug3 and drug4 has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that drug5 may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of drug6 .4,5  Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P 388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by drug7 . 	
In humans, drug1 , drug2 , and drug3 do not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug4 .  	
In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. 	
drug1 did not increase blood levels of high-dose drug2 .	
CYP3A4 Inhibitors: drug1 , an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of drug2 when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions). 	
For patients receiving drug1 or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other drug2 (eg, drug3 , drug4 ) or drug5 (eg, drug6 , drug7 ) or drug8 or drug9 , the recommended dose of drug10 is 2 mg daily. 	
Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between drug1 and laboratory tests have not been studied.	
Since drug1 is metabolized by a P450 enzyme system, drugs that induce or inhibit this drug metabolizing enzyme system may elicit important drug-drug interactions that may alter drug2 plasma concentrations. 	
Agents that might be coadministered with drug1 in AIDS patients for other indications that could elicit this activity include drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 	
In vitro perfusion of isolated rat liver has shown that drug1 caused a significant reduction in drug2 metabolism and that drug3 altered the relative concentration of trimetrexate metabolites possibly by competing for sulfate metabolites. 	
Based on an in vitro rat liver model, nitrogen substituted drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 ) were potent, non-competitive inhibitors of drug5 metabolism. 	
Patients medicated with these drugs and drug1 should be carefully monitored.	
drug1 : Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were observed in patients receiving drug2 concomitantly with drug3 . 	
Physicians should carefully monitor PT and INR in patients concurrently administered drug1 and drug2 . 	
Other drug1 Severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported with concomitant use of drug2 and other drug3 (e.g., drug4 ). 	
Monitor platelet count every 2 weeks for the first 2 months.	
Nasal Spray: Formal studies designed to evaluate drug interactions with drug1 have not been done. 	
No drug interaction studies have been performed with drug1 nasal spray ingredients. 	
Currently, no drug interactions with drug1 have been observed. 	
The effects of prior use of drug1 in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients have not been assessed; 	
however, in patients with Paget's Disease prior drug1 use appears to reduce the anti-resorptive response to drug2 nasal spray.	
The absorption of oral medications may be decreased during the concurrent use of drug1 because of decreased gastric motility and delayed gastric emptying. 	
drug1 should be used with care in patients taking other drugs that are capable of causing CNS effects such as drug2 , drug3 , or drug4 . 	
Special attention should be paid to potential interactions with drugs having anticholinergic properties; 	
e.g., other drug1 , drug2 (including drug3 ), drug4 , and drug5 . 	
Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 will interfere with the gastric secretion test.	
Formal interaction studies of drug1 with other drugs have not been performed. 	
Patients studied in clinical trials of drug1 were routinely treated with drug2 and drug3 . 	
drug1 (such as drug2 and drug3 ) and drugs that alter platelet function (such as drug4 , drug5 , and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after drug6 therapy. 	
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions During drug1 therapy, results of coagulation tests and/or measures of fibrinolytic activity may be unreliable unless specific precautions are taken to prevent in vitro artifacts. 	
 drug1 is an enzyme that, when present in blood in pharmacologic concentrations, remains active under in vitro conditions. 	
This can lead to degradation of fibrinogen in blood samples removed for analysis.	
drug1 may interact with drug2 or drug3 (causing too great a decrease in adrenal function).	
Although drug1 (a mixture of three stereoisomers) has been administered safely following succinylcholine-facilitated tracheal intubation, the interaction between drug2 and drug3 has not been systematically studied. 	
Prior administration of drug1 can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of drug2 . 	
Evidence of spontaneous recovery from drug1 should be observed before the administration of drug2 . 	
The use of drug1 before drug2 to attenuate some of the side effects of drug3 has not been studied. 	
There are no clinical data on the use of drug1 with other drug2 . 	
drug1 and drug2 (administered with drug3 / drug4 to achieve 1.25 M.C. 	
decrease the ED50 of drug1 by as much as 25% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages). 	
These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of drug1 by as much as 35% to 40%. 	
A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of drug1 may be expected with higher concentrations of drug2 or drug3 . 	
 drug1 has little or no effect on the ED50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20%. 	
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of drug1 such as drug2 include certain drug3 (e.g., drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , and drug11 ), drug12 salts, drug13 , local drug14 , drug15 , and drug16 . 	
The neuromuscular blocking effect of drug1 may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral drug2 , drug3 , or certain drug4 ) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing drug5 has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered drug6 or drug7 . 	
While the effects of chronic drug1 or drug2 therapy on the action of drug3 are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher. 	
Some drug interactions are:  - birth control pills - drug1 - medicines for angina or high blood pressure - medicines for pain - medicines to control seizures such as drug2 or drug3 - certain drug4 given by injection - drug5 - drug6 - drug7 - drug8 or drug9 - local drug10 such as drug11 - general drug12 - drug13 or other drug14 	
Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between drug1 and the following agents/classes have been observed. 	
These are described in greater detail below: drug1 and the following agents/classes have been observed. 	
These are described in greater detail below:  Oral drug1 , drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , drug6 , drug7 , drug8 , drug9 , drug10 , drug11 , drug12 ,  Oral drug13 : Clinically significant hypoglycemia may be precipitated by the use of drug14 with oral drug15 ; 	
one fatality has been reported from hypoglycemia in association with combined drug1 and drug2 use. 	
drug1 reduces the metabolism of drug2 , drug3 , and drug4 and increases the plasma concentration of these agents. 	
When drug1 is used concomitantly with these or other drug2 , blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the drug3 should be adjusted as necessary. 	
drug1 : Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant drug2 and drug3 . 	
In post-marketing experience, as with other drug1 , bleeding events (bruising, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and melena) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving drug2 concurrently with drug3 . 	
Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving drug1 and drug2 is recommended. 	
(See &lt;a href= &quot;flucon_cp.htm#CP&quot;>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.) 	
drug1 : drug2 increases the plasma concentrations of drug3 . 	
Careful monitoring of drug1 concentrations in patients receiving drug2 and drug3 is recommended. 	
(See &lt;a href= &quot;flucon_cp.htm#CP&quot;>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.) 	
drug1 : drug2 may significantly increase drug3 levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment. 	
Careful monitoring of drug1 concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving drug2 and drug3 . 	
(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.) 	
drug1 : drug2 enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered drug3 . 	
Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of drug1 when it is administered with drug2 . 	
drug1 : drug2 increases the serum concentrations of drug3 . 	
Careful monitoring of serum drug1 concentrations in patients receiving drug2 and drug3 is recommended. 	
drug1 : Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving drug2 in conjunction with drug3 , interaction studies have been performed. 	
One study at a 200-mg daily dose of drug1 failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval. 	
Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of drug1 demonstrated that drug2 taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of drug3 when taken concomitantly. 	
The combined use of drug1 at doses of 400 mg or greater with drug2 is contraindicated. 	
The coadministration of drug1 at doses lower than 400 mg/day with drug2 should be carefully monitored. 	
drug1 : There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom drug2 and drug3 were coadministered. 	
A controlled study found that concomitant drug1 200 mg once daily and drug2 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in drug3 plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval.	
The combined use of drug1 with drug2 is contraindicated. 	
drug1 : The use of drug2 in patients concurrently taking drug3 or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs. 	
In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering drug1 . 	
Patients should be carefully monitored. 	
drug1 : There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom drug2 and drug3 were coadministered. 	
Patients receiving drug1 and drug2 concomitantly should be carefully monitored. 	
drug1 : There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom drug2 and drug3 were coadministered. 	
Patients receiving drug1 and drug2 concomitantly should be carefully monitored. 	
drug1 : Following oral administration of drug2 , drug3 resulted in substantial increases in drug4 concentrations and psychomotor effects. 	
This effect on drug1 appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of drug2 than with drug3 administered intravenously. 	
If drug1 , which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with drug2 , consideration should be given to decreasing the drug3 dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored. 	
drug1 tablets coadministered with drug2 - and drug3 -containing oral drug4 produced an overall mean increase in drug5 and drug6 levels; 	
however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of drug1 and drug2 levels. 	
The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual drug1 and drug2 AUC values with drug3 treatment are likely the result of random variation. 	
While there is evidence that drug1 can inhibit the metabolism of drug2 and drug3 , there is no evidence that drug4 is a net inducer of drug5 or drug6 metabolism. 	
The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown. 	
Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the &lt;a href= &quot;flucon_cp.htm#CP&quot;&gt;CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur.	
The interaction of drug1 , drug2 , with other drugs has not been well studied. 	
Use of drug1 and drug2 -- drug3 , drug4 , alone or in combination with drug5 and drug6 , may cause bleeding complications. 	
Therefore, careful monitoring is advised. 	
In the treatment of acute MI, drug1 , when not otherwise contraindicated, should be administered with drug2 ( see below ). 	
Anticoagulation and drug1 After Treatment for Myocardial Infarction -- In the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the use of drug2 has been shown to reduce the incidence of reinfarction and stroke. 	
The addition of drug1 to drug2 causes a minimal increase in the risk of minor bleeding (3.9% vs. 3.1%), but does not appear to increase the incidence of major bleeding (see	
When drug1 is used with other drug2 , potentiation of antihypertensive effect may occur. 	
Patients should be followed carefully to detect side reactions or unusual manifestations of drug idiosyncrasy. 	
Patients may require reduced doses of drug1 when on drug2 . 	
If hypotension does occur during anesthesia, it usually can be controlled by drug1 . 	
The adrenergic receptors remain sensitive during treatment with drug1 . 	
When drug1 and drug2 are given concomitantly the patient should be carefully monitored for symptoms of drug3 toxicity. 	
Read the circular for drug1 preparations. 	
Several studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of drug1 when it is ingested with drug2 or drug3 . 	
This may adversely affect blood pressure control in patients treated with drug1 . 	
Coadministration of drug1 with drug2 or drug3 is not recommended. 	
 drug1 : See CONTRAINDICATIONS. 	
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions drug1 may interfere with measurement of: urinary uric acid by the phosphotungstate method, serum creatinine by the alkaline picrate method, and SGOT by colorimetric methods. 	
Interference with spectrophotometric methods for SGOT analysis has not been reported. 	
Since drug1 causes fluorescence in urine samples at the same wave lengths as catecholamines, falsely high levels of urinary catecholamines may be reported. 	
This will interfere with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. 	
It is important to recognize this phenomenon before a patient with a possible pheochromocytoma is subjected to surgery. 	
drug1 does not interfere with measurement of drug2 ( drug3 ), a test for pheochromocytoma, by those methods which convert drug4 to drug5 . 	
 drug1 is not recommended for the treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. 	
Rarely, when urine is exposed to air after voiding, it may darken because of breakdown of drug1 or its metabolites.    	
drug1 : Concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may result in increased systemic toxicity since drug4 inhibit the breakdown of drug5 . 	
Antimyasthenics Concurrent use of drug1 and antimyasthenics may result in loss of control of symptoms of myasthenia gravis due to antagonism of the effects of antimyasthenics on skeletal muscle. 	
Temporary dosage adjustment of antimyasthenics may be required. 	
Also antimyasthenics may have anticholinesterase activity. 	
drug1 medications: Concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may result in additive depressant effects. 	
drug1 : drug2 may increase the diffusion rate of drug3 , resulting in a decreased time of onset, but an increase in systemic toxicity. 	
drug1 (such as drug2 ): Concurrent use of drug3 and drug4 may result in prolongation or enhancement of the neuromuscular blockade. 	
drug1 : Concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may result in a reduction of the antibacterial action of the drug4 . 	
drug1 : Concurrent use of drug2 and drug3 may extend the plasma half-life of drug4 .	
drug1 : Patients on drug2 , and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of drug3 Tablets therapy. 	
The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the drug1 or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with drug2 . 	
If drug1 cannot be interrupted, close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of drug2 Tablets, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour. 	
The rate and extent of drug1 absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant drug2 . 	
The bioavailability of drug1 was reduced by drug2 , however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. 	
drug1 Supplements and drug2 : drug3 Tablets may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. 	
Use of drug1 ( drug2 , drug3 , drug4 and others), drug5 supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium ( drug6 , drug7 , drug8 and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. 	
Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. 	
drug1 : Increased serum drug2 and symptoms of drug3 toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant drug4 and ACE inhibitor therapy. 	
These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum drug1 concentration is recommended. 	
Use of a drug1 may further increase the risk of drug2 toxicity. 	
drug1 : A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma drug2 concentrations when coadministered with drug3 Tablets, but an effect of drug4 on the plasma concentration of drug5 / drug6 has not been excluded. 	
drug1 : Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between drug2 and drug3 . 	
However, this has not been investigated in human studies. 	
Coadministration of both drugs should proceed with caution. 	
Food Interaction: Oral administration of drug1 Tablets with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of drug2 absorption relative to the fasted state. 	
However, the extent of biotransformation of drug1 to the active metabolite, drug2 , is reduced approximately 43%, resulting in a reduction in the plasma ACE inhibition curve of approximately 20%, probably clinically insignificant. 	
In clinical trials, drug1 was generally administered in a non-fasting state.        	
drug1 can interact with the drugs of the following categories:  - Blood dyscrasia: can cause unpredictable myelotoxicity - Bone marrow depressants: can cause a predictable dose-related myelotoxicity - Radiation therapy: may cause marrow depression - Neurotoxic medications: can cause neurologic toxicity - drug2 : can increase seizure activity - drug3 : may potentiate the replication of the drug4 virus, may increase the side effects of the vaccination, and decrease patient's response to the vaccine - drug5 : may cause shortness of breath and bronchospasm - drug6 : may decrease patient's response to the drug7 	
drug1 inhibits some of the liver's ability to metabolize some other drugs - drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , and drug6 . 	
Thus the concentrations of these drugs would increase meaning side effects may be seen. 	
A dose adjustment may be required.	
The concomitant use of drug1 with other drug2 or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. 	
 drug1 may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 	
This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. 	
Mean drug1 plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when drug2 was administered with drug3 , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. 	
Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as drug1 (e.g., drug2 and drug3 ) or drug4 (e.g., drug5 and drug6 ), may alter drug7 mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). 	
The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. 	
Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. 	
Concurrent ingestion of drug1 (20 mL of drug2 containing drug3 , drug4 , and drug5 ) did not significantly affect the exposure of drug6 or drug7 .
