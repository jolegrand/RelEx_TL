-LSB- Interaction between drug1 and drug2 -RSB- . 
The drug interaction between drug1 and drug2 has been the subject of much study in recent years . 
Contradictory results regarding the effect of drug1 on platelet reactivity and on clinical outcome in drug2 - treated patients have been reported in literature . 
Concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 was found to decrease the exposure -LRB- AUC -RRB- to clopidogrel 's active metabolite by 50 % and to sharply increase platelet reactivity , as a result of inhibition by drug3 of CYP2C19 , a cytochrome P450 -LRB- CYP -RRB- enzyme . 
drug1 has a much weaker effect on drug2 's pharmacokinetics and on platelet reactivity during concomitant use . 
The influence of the other drug1 when used simultaneously with drug2 has not yet been investigated in adequately randomized studies . 
Regulatory agencies state that the combination of drug1 and the CYP2C19 inhibitors drug2 and drug3 should be avoided . 
To date , there is no conclusive evidence of a clinically-relevant interaction between any of the drug1 and drug2 . 
Interaction of drug1 and drug2 , in vitro and in vivo , in human A375 melanoma cells . 
We evaluated mechanisms of interaction between the alkyating agent drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- and the pro-oxidant , drug3 , in the human A375 melanoma cell line . 
The effect of drug1 and drug2 , alone and in combination , was evaluated for growth inhibition -LRB- MTT -RRB- , radiolabeled drug uptake , cellular thiol content -LRB- HPLC -RRB- , and DNA strand breaks -LRB- Comet assay -RRB- . 
Pharmacokinetic and antitumor effects were evaluated in mice . 
Growth inhibition in vitro was additive with the two drugs . 
There was no effect on drug uptake or on the number of DNA strand breaks . 
There was a > 75 % reduction in cellular glutathione and cysteine with drug1 but not drug2 . 
Co-administration of the two drugs in mice caused an increase in the area under the curve of both drugs , but the combination was not effective in reducing human A375 melanoma tumors in vivo . 
drug1 and drug2 show additive effects in vitro but not in vivo in human A375 melanoma cells . 
Enhancement of humoral immune responses to inactivated Newcastle disease and drug1 by oral administration of drug2 in chickens . 
Newcastle disease -LRB- ND -RRB- and avian influenza -LRB- AI -RRB- are common in the poultry industry . 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- on the humoral immune responses of chickens to drug3 and drug4 drug4 . 
In experiment 1 , oral administration of drug1 at a dose of 5 mg/kg of BW for 7 d on the immune response in chickens intramuscularly injected with drug2 was evaluated . 
Results showed that drug1 significantly increased the antibody level against ND in the serum of chickens . 
In experiment 2 , the same regimen of drug1 was administered to chickens inoculated with drug2 , and an enhanced serum antibody response to AI vaccination was also observed . 
Considering the safety of drug1 , because no adverse effect was found throughout the experiments , drug2 may be a promising oral adjuvant to improve immunization in poultry . 
Protective effect of drug1 and drug2 against the acute toxicity of diepoxybutane to human lymphocytes . 
The biotransformation and oxidative stress may contribute to 1,2:3,4 - diepoxybutane -LRB- DEB -RRB- - induced toxicity to human lymphocytes of Fanconi Anemia -LRB- FA -RRB- patients . 
Thus , the identification of putative inhibitors of bioactivation , as well as the determination of the protective role of oxidant defenses , on DEB-induced toxicity , can help to understand what is failing in FA cells . 
In the present work we studied the contribution of several biochemical pathways for DEB-induced acute toxicity in human lymphocyte suspensions , by using inhibitors of epoxide hydrolases , inhibitors of protective enzymes as glutathione S-transferase and catalase , the depletion of glutathione -LRB- GSH -RRB- , and the inhibition of protein synthesis ; 
and a variety of putative protective compounds , including antioxidants , and mitochondrial protective agents . 
The present study reports two novel findings : -LRB- i -RRB- it was clearly evidenced , for the first time , that the acute exposure of freshly isolated human lymphocytes to DEB results in severe GSH depletion and loss of ATP , followed by cell death ; 
-LRB- ii -RRB- drug1 elicits a significant protective effect on DEB induced toxicity , which was potentiated by drug2 . 
Collectively , these findings contribute to increase our knowledge of DEB-induce toxicity and will be very useful when applied in studies with lymphocytes from FA patients , in order to find out a protective agent against spontaneous and DEB-induced chromosome instability . 
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist protects dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons from degeneration in drug1 - treated monkeys . 
Degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus are important pathological features of Parkinson 's disease . 
There is an urgent need to develop therapies that slow down the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson 's disease . 
In the present study , we tested whether the highly specific metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist , drug1 , reduces dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by chronic treatment with low doses of drug2 . 
Weekly intramuscular drug1 injections -LRB- 0.2-0 .5 mg/kg body weight -RRB- , in combination with daily administration of drug2 or vehicle , were performed until the development of parkinsonian motor symptoms in either of the two experimental groups -LRB- drug3 / drug4 versus drug5 / vehicle -RRB- . 
After 21 weeks of drug1 treatment , all drug2 / vehicle-treated animals displayed parkinsonian symptoms , whereas none of the drug3 / drug4 - treated monkeys were significantly affected . 
These behavioural observations were consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter imaging data , and with post-mortem stereological counts of midbrain dopaminergic neurons , as well as striatal intensity measurements of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity , which were all significantly higher in drug1 / drug2 - treated animals than in drug3 / vehicle-treated monkeys . 
The drug1 treatment also had a significant effect on the drug2 - induced loss of norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus and adjoining A5 and A7 noradrenaline cell groups . 
In drug1 / vehicle-treated animals , almost 40 % loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neurons was found in locus coeruleus/A5/A7 noradrenaline cell groups , whereas the extent of neuronal loss was lower than 15 % of control values in drug2 / drug3 - treated monkeys . 
Our data demonstrate that chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist , drug1 , significantly reduces drug2 toxicity towards dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell groups in non-human primates . 
This suggests that the use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists may be a useful strategy to reduce degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons in Parkinson 's disease . 
In vitro activity of drug1 combined with drug2 against clinical isolates of drug3 - resistant Staphylococcus aureus . 
This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of drug1 combined with drug2 against isolates of drug3 - resistant Staphylococcus aureus -LRB- MRSA -RRB- . 
A total of 87 clinical isolates of MRSA collected from three Chinese hospitals were included in the study . 
The checkerboard method with determination of the fractional IC index -LRB- FICI -RRB- was used to determine whether drug1 combinations act synergistically against these isolates . 
The susceptibility results for drug1 and drug2 were interpreted according to the most relevant criteria . 
The results demonstrated the following interactions : 76 isolates -LRB- 87.4 % -RRB- showed synergistic interactions -LRB- FICI 0.5 -RRB- and 11 isolates -LRB- 12.6 % -RRB- showed indifferent interactions -LRB- 0.5 & lt ; FICI & lt ; 4 -RRB- . 
No antagonistic interactions -LRB- FICI 4 -RRB- were observed . 
The combination of drug1 and drug2 can be synergistic against MRSA . 
Further studies are required to determine the potential clinical role of this combination regimen as a therapeutic alternative for certain types of MRSA infections . 
drug1 enhances drug2 - mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by up-regulation of cell surface HER2 expression . 
Although it was previously reported that drug1 combined with drug2 improved the progression-free survival rate compared with drug3 alone for patients with drug4 - refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer , the mechanism is purported to be an antiproliferative effect relating to the synergism of these two agents . 
We evaluated how drug1 interacts with drug2 in HER2-positive breast cancer , with a particular focus on drug3 - mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity -LRB- ADCC -RRB- . 
In an in vitro assay , drug1 induced HER2 expression at the cell surface of HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines , leading to the enhancement of drug2 - mediated ADCC . 
Furthermore , we present a case report in which a second drug1 treatment following drug2 resulted in the marked shrinkage of multiple metastatic tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer . 
drug1 may have the potential to convert drug2 - refractory to drug3 - sensitive tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer by up-regulation of the cell surface expression of HER2 . 
Improved parathyroid hormone control by drug1 is associated with reduction in drug2 requirement in patients with end-stage renal disease . 
Uncontrolled hy-per-parathyroidism causes bone marrow fibrosis , leading to drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- resistance . 
Medical treatment with drug1 is effective in reducing plasma parathyroid hormone -LRB- PTH -RRB- levels , but its effect on drug2 dosing is unknown . 
METHODS AND AIMS : We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 40 end-stage renal disease -LRB- ESRD -RRB- patients -LRB- age : 55 14 ; mean SD ; 21 : male -RRB- who had at least 12 months of drug1 therapy . 
The distribution of renal replacement therapies were : 14 peritoneal dialysis , 18 conventional hemodialysis and 8 nocturnal hemodialysis . 
Standard dialysis related biochemical indices and medications used were recorded . 
The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the difference in drug1 responsiveness before and after 12 months of drug2 therapy . 
Our secondary objective was to determine if there was a relationship between the changes in PTH and drug1 requirement . 
Overall , PTH levels decreased from 197.5 -LRB- 151.8 ; 249.2 -RRB- to 66.1 -LRB- 41.2 ; 136.5 -RRB- -LRB- median -LRB- 25th ; 75th percentile -RRB- -RRB- pmol/l ; 
p & lt ; 
0.001 . 
drug1 dose increased from 30.0 6 to 63 25 mg/day , p < 
0.05 . 
Hemoglobin remained unchanged -LRB- 116 13 to 116 13 g/l -RRB- , while drug1 requirement decreased from 40 -LRB- 20 ; 60 -RRB- to 24 -LRB- 19 ; 59 -RRB- g/week , p = 0.02 . 
The remainder of the dialysis-related biochemistry -LRB- electrolytes , calcium , phosphate , iron status -RRB- and vitamin D use remained unchanged . 
A reduction in PTH level of greater than 30 % was experienced by 82.5 % -LRB- 33/40 -RRB- of our cohort . 
Among the responders , the fall in PTH and reduction drug1 requirement were related -LRB- R = -0.48 , p = 0.004 -RRB- . 
Reduction of PTH by drug1 is associated with a decrease in drug2 requirement . 
The interface between bone and bone marrow in uremia represents a critical step in red blood cell production which merits further investigation . 
drug1 does not inhibit the absorption of 5 milligrams of drug2 or drug3 at doses less than 800 milligrams in nonpregnant women . 
drug1 is the only known component in the diet that may affect absorption of both drug2 and drug3 . 
However , the evidence for a drug1 effect on drug2 absorption mainly comes from studies that did not isolate the effect of drug3 from that of other dietary components , because it was detected in single-meal studies . 
Our objective was to establish potential effects of drug1 on absorption of drug2 and drug3 and the dose response for this effect in the absence of a meal . 
Fifty-four healthy , nonpregnant women were selected to participate in 4 drug1 absorption studies using iron radioactive tracers . 
We evaluated the effects of drug1 doses between 200 and 1500 mg on absorption of 5 mg drug2 -LRB- as drug3 -RRB- . 
We also evaluated the effects of drug1 doses between 200 and 800 mg on absorption of 5 mg drug2 -LSB- as concentrated RBC -LRB- CRBC -RRB- -RSB- . 
drug1 was administered as drug2 in all studies and drug3 were ingested on an empty stomach . 
drug1 doses 1000 mg diminished drug2 absorption by an average of 49.6 % . 
A drug1 dose of 800 mg diminished absorption of 5 mg drug2 by 37.7 % . 
In conclusion , we demonstrated an isolated effect of drug1 -LRB- as chloride -RRB- on absorption of 5 mg of iron provided as drug2 -LRB- as sulfate -RRB- and drug3 -LRB- as CRBC -RRB- drug3 . 
This effect was observed at doses higher than previously reported from single-meal studies , starting at ~ 800 mg of drug1 . 
Synergistic interaction between drug1 and drug2 is sequence dependent in human non-small lung cancer with EGFR TKIs-resistant mutation . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that drug1 has the anti-tumor activity in human non-small cell lung cancer -LRB- NSCLC -RRB- . 
This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of drug1 and that of concurrent or sequential administration of drug2 and drug3 in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to EGFR TKIs . 
NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M mutation and K-ras mutation were exposed to either drug1 or drug2 or both based on various sequential administrations . 
After exposure , the cell viability was measured by MTT assay , cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry , and alterations in signaling pathway were determined by immunoblotting . 
drug1 exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in NSCLC cell lines and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase , whereas drug2 arrested at S phase . 
Although single or concurrent use of drug1 and drug2 has some anti-proliferative effects , the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti-tumor activity . 
When cells were exposed to drug1 followed by drug2 , synergism was observed . 
The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by drug1 exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to drug2 . 
In contrast , the reverse of this sequential administration resulted in antagonism , which may be due to differential effects on cell cycle arrest . 
drug1 as a single agent exhibits anti-proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M and K-ras mutations but the sequential administration of drug2 followed by drug3 is superior to drug4 followed by drug5 and concurrent administration . 
Determinants of sensitivity to drug1 induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells . 
The drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- , one of S-adenosylhomocysteine -LRB- AdoHcy -RRB- hydrolase inhibitors , has shown antitumor activities in a broad range of solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia . 
Here , we examined its effects on multiple myeloma -LRB- MM -RRB- cells and found that , at 500 nM , it potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in 2 of 8 MM cell lines . 
RNA from un-treated and drug1 treated cells was profiled by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and genes with a significant change in gene expression were determined by significance analysis of microarray -LRB- SAM -RRB- testing . 
ALOX5 was the most down-regulated gene -LRB- 5.8-fold -RRB- in sensitive cells and was expressed at low level in resistant cells . 
The results were corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR . 
Western-blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon drug1 treatment . 
Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to drug1 in H929 cells . 
Furthermore , down-regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929 . 
Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells . 
We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in drug1 insensitive cells , and cotreatment with drug2 and drug3 , a Bcl-2 family inhibitor , synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of drug4 insensitive MM cells . 
Taken together , this study shows one of mechanisms of the drug1 efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down-regulate the ALOX5 levels . 
In addition , drug1 insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2 , and the combination of drug2 and drug3 could synergistically induced apoptosis . 
These results suggest that drug1 may be exploited therapeutically for a subset of MM . 
Drug interaction of drug1 with infant colic drops . 
drug1 -LRB- Forest Laboratories UK , Kent , UK -RRB- is a widely available over-the-counter preparation used to relieve colic symptoms in neonates and infants . 
The active ingredient is drug1 . 
No drug interactions with drug1 are documented in the current summary of product characteristics . 
The authors report the case of an infant with confirmed congenital hypothyroidism on drug1 who experienced a possible drug interaction with drug2 . 
Despite adequate drug1 dosage , thyroid stimulating hormone -LRB- TSH -RRB- was high , suggesting undertreatment . 
Questioning revealed the child was taking drug1 drops before feeds while on drug2 . 
The colic drops were immediately discontinued and TSH promptly normalised with a reduction in thyroxine requirement to an age appropriate dosage . 
Drug interaction of drug1 with drug2 has not been reported previously and is not listed in the British National Formulary for Children . 
Clinicians and parents need to be aware of this interaction to avoid unnecessary undertreatment and prevent potential long-term neurological sequelae . 
drug1 locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference in adolescent male and female rats neonatally treated with drug2 . 
Neonatal drug1 treatment has been shown to produce an increase in dopamine D2-like receptor sensitivity that persists throughout the subject 's lifetime . 
The objective was to analyze the effects of neonatal drug1 treatment on effects of drug2 in adolescent rats using locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference procedures . 
Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with drug1 -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- or saline from postnatal days -LRB- P -RRB- 1 to P11 and raised to adolescence . 
For locomotor sensitization , subjects were given drug1 -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- or saline every second day from P35 to P47 and were placed into a locomotor arena . 
In female rats , neonatal drug1 treatment enhanced drug2 locomotor sensitization compared with drug3 - free controls sensitized to drug4 . 
Male rats demonstrated sensitization to drug1 , although this was muted compared with female rats , and were unaffected by neonatal drug2 . 
For conditioned place preference , subjects were conditioned for 8 consecutive days -LRB- P32-39 -RRB- with drug1 -LRB- 1 mg/kg -RRB- or saline and a drug-free preference test was conducted at P40 . 
Rats treated with neonatal drug1 enhanced time spent in the drug2 - paired context compared with drug3 - free controls conditioned with drug4 , but only female controls conditioned with drug5 spent more time in the drug-paired context compared with saline-treated controls . 
Increased D - like receptor sensitivity appears to have enhanced the behavioral effects of drug1 , but these effects were more prevalent in adolescent female rats compared with male rats . 
Effect of drug1 - mediated CYP3A4 inhibition on clinical pharmacokinetics of drug2 -LRB- drug3 -RRB- , an orally active drug4 . 
drug1 is partly metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro . 
This study evaluated the effect of a potent CYP3A inhibitor , drug1 , on the pharmacokinetics and safety of drug2 . 
Patients received a single drug1 oral dose on day 1 , followed by 4 days wash-out period . 
On days 5-9 , drug1 was administered . 
On day 8 , a single drug1 dose was co-administered with drug2 . 
drug1 was administered as single agent three times a week on day 15 and onward . 
In the presence of drug1 , there was 1.6 - and 1.8-fold increase in C -LRB- max -RRB- and AUC of drug2 , respectively . 
No substantial change in T -LRB- max -RRB- or half-life was observed . 
No difference in drug1 - pharmacokinetics between patients carrying CYP3A5 * 1 / * 3 and CYP3A5 * 3 / * 3 alleles was observed . 
Most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal related . 
Patients had asymptomatic hypophosphatemia -LRB- 64 % -RRB- , and urine analysis suggested renal phosphate wasting . 
Co-administration of drug1 with CYP3A inhibitors is feasible as the observed increase in drug2 PK parameters was not considered clinically relevant . 
Considering the variability in exposure following enzyme inhibition and the fact that chronic dosing of drug1 was not studied with CYP3A inhibitors , close monitoring of drug2 - related adverse events is necessary . 
Effects of CYP inhibitors on drug1 metabolism and toxicity in rat liver slices . 
We present a comprehensive in vitro approach to assessing metabolism-mediated hepatotoxicity using male Sprague-Dawley rat liver slices incubated with the well characterized hepatotoxicant , drug1 , and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 -LRB- CYP -RRB- enzymes . 
This approach combines liquid chromatography mass spectrometry -LRB- LC MS -RRB- detection methods with multiple toxicity endpoints to enable identification of critical metabolic pathways for hepatotoxicity . 
The incubations were performed in the absence and presence of the non-specific CYP inhibitor , drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- and isoform-specific inhibitors . 
The metabolite profile of drug1 in rat liver slices shares some features of the in vivo profile , but also had a major difference in that epoxide dihydrodiol hydrolysis products were not observed to a measurable extent . 
As examples of our liver slice metabolite identification procedure , a minor glutathione adduct and previously unreported 7-O-desmethyl and glucuronidated metabolites of drug1 are reported . 
drug1 induced hepatocellular necrosis in a dose - and time-dependent manner . 
drug1 decreased the toxicity of drug2 , increased exposure to parent compound , and decreased metabolite levels in a dose-dependent manner . 
Of the isoform-specific CYP inhibitors tested for an effect on the drug1 metabolite profile , only drug2 was noticeably effective , indicating a role of CYPs 2A6 , 2C9 , 2Cl9 , and 2E1 . 
With respect to toxicity , the order of CYP inhibitor effectiveness was drug1 > drug2 ~ drug3 > drug4 . 
drug1 and drug2 had no effect , while drug3 appeared to augment drug4 toxicity . 
These results suggest that rat liver slices do not reproduce the reported in vivo biotransformation of drug1 and therefore may not be an appropriate model for drug2 metabolism . 
However , these results provide an example of how small molecule manipulation of CYP activity in an in vitro model can be used to confirm metabolism-mediated toxicity . 
Glycosidic enzymes enhance retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of drug1 . 
To determine whether the co-injection of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes improves retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- . 
drug1 containing cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein -LRB- GFP -RRB- , under the control of a chicken - actin promoter , was delivered by intravitreal injection to adult mice in conjunction with enzymes including drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , or drug5 . 
Two weeks later , retinal flatmounts were examined for GFP expression using confocal microscopy . 
Without the addition of enzymes , transduction was limited to occasional cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer . 
The addition of drug1 or drug2 greatly enhanced transduction of the retinal ganglion cell layer and increased the depth of transduction into the outer retina . 
drug1 had a limited effect and drug2 was ineffective . 
Electroretinograms survived with higher concentrations of drug1 and drug2 than were required for optimal retinal transduction . 
drug1 - mediated retinal transduction is improved by co-injection of drug2 or drug3 . 
Improved transduction efficiency may allow intravitreal injection to become the preferred route for delivering gene therapy to both the inner and outer retina . 
drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- -- better than drug3 -LRB- drug4 -RRB- 
The FDA has approved drug1 -LRB- drug2 - AstraZeneca -RRB- , an oral drug3 , for use with low-dose drug4 to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome -LRB- ACS -RRB- . 
It will compete with drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- and drug3 -LRB- drug4 -RRB- for such use . 
drug1 is expected to become available generically in the US within the next few months . 
The role of p27 -LRB- Kip1 -RRB- in drug1 - enhanced drug2 cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cells . 
Less than 50 % of ovarian cancers respond to drug1 . 
Effective strategies are needed to enhance drug1 sensitivity . 
A library of silencing RNAs -LRB- siRNAs -RRB- was used to identify kinases that regulate drug1 sensitivity in human ovarian cancer SKOv3 cells . 
The effect of drug1 , an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases , on drug2 sensitivity was measured in ovarian cancer cells and HEY xenografts . 
The roles of p27 -LRB- Kip1 -RRB- , Bcl-2 , and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by drug1 and drug2 were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling -LRB- TUNEL -RRB- assay , siRNA knockdown of gene expression , transfection with Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression vectors , and flow cytometry . 
All statistical tests were two-sided . 
Src family and Abl kinases were identified as modulators of drug1 sensitivity in SKOv3 cells . 
The siRNA knockdown of Src , Fyn , or Abl1 enhanced drug1 - mediated growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells compared with a control siRNA . 
HEY cells treated with drug1 plus drug2 formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone . 
Treatment of HEY xenograft-bearing mice with drug1 plus drug2 inhibited tumor growth more than treatment with either agent alone -LRB- average tumor volume per mouse , drug3 + drug4 vs drug5 : 0.28 vs. 0.81 cm3 , difference = 0.53 cm3 , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- = 0.44 to 0.62 cm3 , P = .014 -RRB- ; 
drug1 + drug2 vs. 
drug1 : 0.28 vs. 
0.55 cm3 , difference = 0.27 cm3 , 95 % CI = 0.21 to 0.33 cm3 , P = .035 -RRB- . 
Combined treatment induced more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells than did either agent alone . 
The siRNA knockdown of p27 -LRB- Kip1 -RRB- decreased drug1 - and drug2 - induced apoptosis compared with a negative control siRNA -LRB- sub-G1 fraction , control siRNA vs. p27 -LRB- Kip1 -RRB- siRNA : 42.5 % vs. 20.1 % , difference = 22.4 % , 95 % CI = 20.1 % to 24.7 % , P = .017 -RRB- . 
Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 suggest that drug1 - mediated induction of p27 -LRB- Kip1 -RRB- enhanced drug2 - induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression . 
Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or drug1 enhances drug2 sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through p27 -LRB- Kip1 -RRB- - mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression . 
Influence of drug1 on drug2 induced antinociception and its pharmacokinetics . 
drug1 -LRB- CAS 94-62-2 -RRB- , an alkaloid obtained from Piper nigrum and P. 
longum , is a known inhibitor of various enzymes -LRB- CYP isozymes -RRB- responsible for biotransformation of drugs . 
By inhibiting the metabolism of drugs , drug1 improves the bioavailability of drugs . 
In the present study drug1 -LRB- 10 mg/kg -RRB- significantly increased the dose-dependent antinociceptive activity of drug2 evaluated by both drug3 writhing and formalin test , when it was administered with drug4 . 
drug1 plasma concentration was also increased when it was administered with drug2 . 
The synergistic antinociception activity of drug1 when administered with drug2 can be attributed to increased plasma concentration of drug3 . 
From this study it can be concluded that drug1 can be used as a bioenhancer along with drug2 . 
Prevention of emergence agitation in seven children receiving low-dose drug1 and drug2 total intravenous anesthesia . 
Emergence agitation -LRB- EA -RRB- can be a distressing side effect of pediatric anesthesia . 
We retrospectively reviewed the records of 7 pediatric oncology patients who received low-dose drug1 in conjunction with drug2 for total intravenous anesthesia -LRB- TIVA -RRB- repeatedly for radiation therapy . 
EA signs were observed in all 7 patients in association with drug1 TIVA but did not recur in any of 123 subsequent anesthetics sessions during which low-dose drug2 was added to drug3 . 
Based on this experience , we suggest that low-dose drug1 added to drug2 may be associated with prevention of EA in children with a history of EA with drug3 TIVA . 
-LSB- Efficacy of fixed combination drug1 / drug2 in hospitalized patients with hypertensive disease -RSB- 
Efficacy and tolerability of fixed drug1 / drug2 combination was studied in 86 patients with hypertensive disease hospitalized in departments of general internal medicine or cardiology . 
All patients had indications for antihypertensive therapy and were randomized either to fixed combination drug1 / drug2 -LRB- n = 43 -RRB- or to therapy which corresponded to the hospital formulary -LRB- n = 43 -RRB- . 
Correction of drug1 therapy was performed by treating physician at daily rounds . 
Self-control of blood pressure -LRB- BP -RRB- was performed by patients with the use of UA767PC apparatus . 
Results of BP self-control were compared with clinical measurements in order to detect concealed inefficacy of treatment . 
Results . 
Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination drug1 / drug2 -LRB- 93 % -RRB- was comparable with that on traditional therapy -LRB- 90 % -RRB- . 
But the use of fixed combination drug1 / drug2 compared with traditional therapy was associated with lower clinical and self measured BP , quicker achievement of target BP -LRB- 5.8 + / -2.3 and 9.2 + / -1.8 days , respectively , 0.05 -RRB- , lesser number of drug3 -LRB- 2.5 + / -0.6 and 3.0 + / -0.9 days , respectively -RRB- , lower rate of concealed inefficacy of treatment -LRB- 12 and 31 % , respectively , 0.05 -RRB- . 
Conclusions . 
We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed drug1 / drug2 combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time , with the use of fewer drug3 , and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment . 
Antitumor effects of drug1 , a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF , in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia . 
The therapeutic outcome for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia -LRB- T-ALL -RRB- remains poor ; 
thus , novel , targeted therapies are urgently needed . 
Recently , we showed that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor -LRB- HB-EGF -RRB- , a member of the EGF family , is a promising target for the treatment of various types of cancer . 
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HB-EGF is a therapeutic target for T-ALL , and to further elucidate the antitumor effects of a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF , drug1 -LRB- drug2 -RRB- . 
We elucidated the expression of HB-EGF in T-ALL cell lines , and evaluated the effect of drug1 on these cells alone or in combination with drug2 . 
The expression of EGFR and EGFR ligands was determined by flow cytometry , RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR . 
Induction of apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay . 
HB-EGF was strongly expressed by T-ALL cell lines , and the expression of both HB-EGF and EGFR was enhanced by drug1 . 
drug1 induced apoptosis , and furthermore , the combination of drug2 plus drug3 enhanced cytotoxicity in a T-ALL cell line . 
These results suggest that HB-EGF is a promising therapeutic target for T-ALL . 
Distinct synergistic action of drug1 and drug2 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . 
The dicarbonyl compound drug1 is a natural constituent of Manuka honey produced from Manuka flowers in New Zealand . 
It is known to possess both anticancer and antibacterial activity . 
Such observations prompted to investigate the ability of drug1 as a potent drug against multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa . 
A total of 12 test P. 
aeruginosa strains isolated from various hospitals were tested for their resistances against many drug1 , most of which are applied in the treatment of P. 
aeruginosa infections . 
Results revealed that the strains were resistant to many drugs at high levels , only drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 showed resistances at comparatively lower levels . 
Following multiple experimentations it was observed that drug1 was also antimicrobic against all the strains at comparable levels . 
Distinct and statistically significant synergism was observed between drug1 and drug2 by disc diffusion tests when compared with their individual effects . 
The fractional inhibitory concentration index of this combination evaluated by checkerboard analysis , was 0.5 , which confirmed synergism between the pair . 
Synergism was also noted when drug1 was combined with drug2 and drug3 . 
drug1 failure in an HIV-positive woman on drug2 therapy resulting in two ectopic pregnancies . 
Since its introduction in 1999 , drug1 remains one of the preferred contraceptive choices for many women as it offers a highly effective means of long-term contraception for three years that does not rely on adherence . 
Like all drug1 , certain hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs may reduce its efficacy . 
We present an interesting case of an HIV-positive woman on drug1 therapy having tubal pregnancies on two separate occasions with drug2 in place . 
drug1 and CYP 2D6 inhibitors : caution . 
drug1 , an drug2 , is the standard hormone treatment for breast cancer . 
It is extensively transformed into its active metabolites by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system , especially into drug1 by isoenzyme CYP 2D6 . 
Co-administration of drug1 with isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors reduces this metabolism . 
drug1 inhibit isoenzyme CYP 2D6 . 
drug1 and drug2 reduce the plasma concentration of drug3 by about 50 % . 
Two epidemiological studies involving about 3700 women have shown a link between the use of drug1 and an increased frequency of breast cancer recurrence . 
Other studies , with a lower level of evidence , were less convincing . 
Studies of other isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors showed no increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence , but they lacked statistical power . 
It is better to avoid prescribing isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors to women treated with drug1 for breast cancer , especially drug2 such as drug3 and drug4 . 
Depression does not always require drug1 therapy , and drug2 have no proven preventive impact on hot flushes linked to the menopause . 
If in certain cases , an drug1 is considered necessary , it may be advisable to replace drug2 with drug3 . 
Phase I trial of drug1 and drug2 in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma : evidence for drug3 - drug4 interaction via P-glycoprotein . 
Multiple myeloma -LRB- MM -RRB- is an incurable plasma-cell neoplasm for which most treatments involve a therapeutic agent combined with drug1 . 
The preclinical combination of drug1 with the mTOR inhibitor drug2 has displayed synergy in vitro and represents a novel combination in MM . 
In vivo CYP3A activity is significantly lower in drug1 - treated as compared with drug2 - treated renal allograft recipients . 
In vitro studies have identified drug1 and drug2 as CYP3A inhibitors . 
In the current study in renal allograft recipients , we used intravenously and orally administered drug1 as a drug probe to assess whether the study drugs at doses that are generally used in clinical practice have differential effects on in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities . 
Systemic and apparent oral drug1 clearance were 24 % -LRB- 269 73 vs. 354 102 ml/min , P = 0.022 -RRB- and 31 % -LRB- 479 190 vs. 688 265 ml/min , P = 0.013 -RRB- , respectively , lower in drug2 - treated patients -LRB- n = 20 -RRB- than in matched drug3 - treated patients -LRB- n = 20 -RRB- . 
The latter displayed drug1 clearances similar to those in two larger cohorts of nonmatched drug2 - treated patients -LRB- n = 58 and n = 80 -RRB- and to those receiving a drug3 - free regimen -LRB- n = 6 -RRB- . 
This implies that in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities are significantly lower in patients receiving drug1 than in those receiving drug2 , indicating that , at the doses generally used in clinical practice , drug3 is the stronger of the two with respect to CYP3A inhibition . 
This observation has important implications in the context of drug-drug interactions in transplant recipients . 
-LSB- Influence of drug1 and drug2 on MPTP-evoked behavior violations in C57BL/6 mice -RSB- . 
The effects of drug1 drug2 -LSB- drug3 -RSB- -LRB- 10 mg/kg , p. o. -RRB- 
and/or drug1 drug2 -LRB- 100 mg/kg , p. o. -RRB- , as well as that of neurotoxin drug3 -LRB- drug4 -RRB- -LRB- 4 x 20 mg/kg , i. p. -RRB- 
were studied in elevated plus maze test on C57BL/6 mice . 
On second day after injection , drug1 decreased the locomot or activity in comparison to saline . 
Acute administration of drug1 or drug2 failed to influence locomotion in mice , while their combination normalized motor activity . 
The results obtained confirm the role of inflammatory processes in parkinsonism and suggest expediency of combined pharmacotherapy of neurodegenerative diseases . 
Exposure to oral drug1 is unaffected by drug2 but greatly increased by drug3 . 
This study examined drug-drug interactions of oral drug1 with the cytochrome P450 -LRB- CYP -RRB- 2B6 inhibitor drug2 and the CYP3A inhibitor drug3 . 
In this randomized , blinded , crossover study , 11 healthy volunteers ingested 0.2 mg/kg drug1 after pretreatments with oral drug2 -LRB- 250 mg twice daily -RRB- , drug3 -LRB- 200 mg once daily -RRB- , or placebo in 6-day treatment periods at intervals of 4 weeks . 
drug1 treatment increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity -LRB- AUC -LRB- 0 - -RRB- -RRB- of oral drug2 by 2.4-fold , whereas drug3 treatment did not increase the exposure to drug4 . 
The ratio of drug1 AUC -LRB- 0 - -RRB- to drug2 AUC -LRB- 0 - -RRB- was significantly decreased in the drug3 -LRB- P & lt ; 0.001 -RRB- drug4 zole phases -LRB- P = 0.006 -RRB- as compared to placebo . 
In the drug1 and drug2 phases , the areas under the effect-time curves -LRB- self-reported drowsiness and performance -RRB- were significantly higher than those in the placebo phase -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- . 
The findings suggest that the dosage of drug1 should be reduced in patients receiving drug2 . 
Interaction of drug1 with different drug2 is antagonistic in breast but not in other cancer cells . 
drug1 , an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 , is being investigated for enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy in cancer clinical trials . 
This study investigates the ability of drug1 to sensitize cells from different origins to several drug2 . 
The effect of the drug 's mechanism of action and sequence of administration are also investigated . 
The sensitivity , cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA damage of five different cancer cell lines -LRB- HeLa , HCT116 , HepG2 , MCF7 and U251 -RRB- to drug1 , drug2 , drug3 and drug4 drug5 following different incubation schedules were analyzed . 
We found antagonism between drug1 and the four drugs in the breast cancer cells MCF7 following all incubation schedules and between drug2 and drug3 in all cell lines except for two combinations in HCT116 cells . 
drug1 with the other three drugs in the remaining four cell lines resulted in variable interactions . 
Mechanistic investigations revealed that drug1 exerts different molecular effects in different cells . 
In some lines , it abrogates the drug-induced G2/M arrest enhancing pre-mature entry into mitosis with damaged DNA thus increasing apoptosis and resulting in synergism . 
In other cells , it enhances drug-induced G2/M arrest allowing time to repair drug-induced DNA damage before entry into mitosis and decreasing cell death resulting in antagonism . 
In some synergistic combinations , celecoxib-induced abrogation of G2/M arrest was not associated with apoptosis but permanent arrest in G1 phase . 
These results , if confirmed in-vivo , indicate that drug1 is not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with drug2 for other cancers . 
Moreover , combination of drug1 with other drugs should be tailored to the tumor type , drug and administration schedule . 
drug1 - drug2 interaction and associated gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case-control study . 
Bleeding is the most common and worrisome adverse effect of drug1 therapy . 
One of the factors that might increase bleeding risk is initiation of interacting drugs that potentiate drug1 . 
We sought to evaluate whether initiation of an drug1 increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in drug2 users . 
Medicaid claims data -LRB- 1999-2005 -RRB- were used to perform an observational case-control study nested within person-time exposed to drug1 in those 18 years . 
In total , 430,455 drug1 users contributed 407,370 person-years of drug2 use . 
The incidence rate of hospitalization for GI bleeding among drug1 users was 4.48 per 100 person-years -LRB- 95 % CI , 4.42-4 .55 -RRB- . 
Each gastrointestinal bleeding cases was matched to 50 controls based on index date and state . 
drug1 users had an increased odds ratio of gastrointestinal bleeding upon initiation of drug2 -LRB- OR = 1.73 -LSB- 95 % CI , 1.25-2 .38 -RSB- -RRB- , drug3 -LRB- OR = 1.63 -LSB- 95 % CI , 1.11-2 .38 -RSB- -RRB- , drug4 -LRB- OR = 1.64 -LSB- 95 % CI , 1.27-2 .12 -RSB- -RRB- , drug5 -LRB- OR = 1.47 -LSB- 95 % CI , 1.02-2 .11 -RSB- -RRB- . 
Also drug1 , which is not believed to interact with drug2 , increased the risk of GI bleeding -LRB- OR = 1.75 -LSB- 95 % CI , 1.30-2 .35 -RSB- -RRB- . 
drug1 users who initiated drug2 , drug3 , drug4 , drug5 , or drug6 had an increased risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding . 
However , the elevated risk with drug1 suggests that a drug-drug interaction may not have been responsible for all of the observed increased risk . 
drug1 enhances the antinociceptive effect of drug2 in mice . 
drug1 , a highly selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist , was recently introduced into clinical practice for its sedative and analgesic properties . 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the psychostimulant drug drug1 has any effect on drug2 - induced antinociception and locomotor inhibitor activity in mice in acute application . 
In both sexes of swiss albino mice ; 
antinociception was assessed with hot-plate test and the locomotor , exploratory activities were assessed with holed open field test . 
The animals were received ; 
saline + saline , drug1 -LRB- 10 mg/kg -RRB- + saline , saline + drug2 -LRB- 15 g/kg -RRB- and drug3 -LRB- 10 mg/kg -RRB- + drug4 -LRB- 15 g/kg -RRB- , intraperitoneally , 30 min before hot plate or holed open field tests . 
In the hot plate test in mice , co-administration of 15 g/kg drug1 with 10 mg/kg drug2 intraperitoneally not only enhanced , but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by drug3 . 
At the same time , the locomotor inhibitory effect of drug1 was counteracted by drug2 . 
We concluded that the combined administration of drug1 with drug2 may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation , which limits the use of drug3 as an drug4 in humans . 
Interaction study of drug1 and drug2 with co-administered drugs . 
drug1 and drug2 are drug3 used in treating urinary and respiratory tract infections . 
drug1 are known to have interactions with drugs that are active in gastro intestinal tract . 
Being drug1 and lomefloxacin drug2 the interaction study of was carried out with drug3 , drug4 , drug5 and drug6 . 
The interaction was studied at neutral , acidic and basic conditions both at room temperature and 37 C . 
The effect of dissolution medium simulating various body environments with response to pH has been examined in order to elucidate the interactions . 
The response of drug1 and drug2 after interaction with co-administered drugs at different conditions and temperature were noted using a Shimadzu HPLC system with PDA detector . 
It was seen that interaction of these drug1 was more at 37 C than at room temperature . 
drug1 and drug2 reacts faster with drug3 and drug4 in acidic media whereas with drug5 in basic media and drug6 in neutral media . 
The study ensures the interaction of drug1 with selected class of drugs . 
In order to achieve the effective therapeutic effect appropriate time intervals between administrations of drugs is essential .
